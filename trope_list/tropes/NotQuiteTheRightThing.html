<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry">Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry</a></em>: Sara can't bring herself to kill her brother, despite witnessing the massacre at Grabera. Because of this, he kills yet another person that Sara has allowed herself to care about. Although he is still the most important person in her life, she decides to stop him from hurting anyone else.
</li><li> The anime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> begins with this trope: a doctor disobeys hospital director's orders and saves the life of a child whose foster parents had been killed, only to discover ten years later that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">the child had murdered said foster parents himself</a> and committed a string of other murders since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and prior to</span> then as well. Not to mention that said child decided to "thank" him by killing the director <em>and</em> the entire board that demoted him. And then to be even more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend">Poisonous Friend</a>, Tenma himself ends up getting the blame for these murders, and turns fugitive years later when the boy returns and kills one of his patients, who was an accomplice in the boy's serial mass murder of entire families. Tenma gets blamed for that too.
</li><li> Discussed in episode 23 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em>, Yu wonders, having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">breakdown as he does</a>, to Yosuke if he made the right decision to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spare Namatame, since Namatame was responsible for Nanako's kidnapping and subsequent death</span>. His decision ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out to have been the right one, leading to both Nanako's revival and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that Namatame, while also responsible for Yukiko, Kanji, Rise and Naoto's kidnappings, was <em>not</em> responsible for the murders or the warning letter Yu had previously received</span>.

Turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vamdemon</span> didn't plan on using that entrance at all - he made everyone think he did, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man he was possessing at the time and influencing to carry out his plans</span>. Instead, he tricked the cast into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">following him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamLand">another dimension powered by dreams and wishes</a>, where he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">regain his physical body and become much stronger than before</a></span>.
</li><li> Pressured into trying to sell one thousand copies of her doujin when selling one tenth of that would be next to impossible, Nagi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> ignores working on the doujin itself, knowing there's no way she can make it good enough. If she doesn't sell at least seven hundred, she'll take a loss of up to (about) two thousand dollars. Instead, she spends her time making an extensive advertising campaign focused on photos of Maria and attaches them to the doujin as a a bonus. While the doujin does sell, nobody cares about it and they simply throw it away, often right in front of her, because all they care about is the photo book. Given that Nagi wanted to prove to herself that she was special and talented, all she managed to do was make it even more obvious that her manga was worthless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Loke, also known as Leo, does this at one point. He, one of the Celestial Spirits, along with his fellow spirit Aries, are under contract with the cruel Karen Lilica, who treats them like property. When Karen plans on punishing Aries for (supposedly) tattling on her to her guild master, Leo forcibly swaps places with Aries and gives Karen an ultimatum- cancel both their contracts or he'll stay in the real world, since Karen can't summon more than one spirit at a time. While Karen initially thinks Loke's bluffing (since spirits can't stay in the human world for extended periods of time), as time goes on and she can't work due to not being able to summon a spirit, she tries to fool him into thinking she's turned over a new leaf, but he doesn't believe her. Karen then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">goes out on a job despite not being able to summon her spirits</a>, getting herself killed. This causes Loke to be exiled from the spirit world until Lucy pleads his case with the Celestial Spirit King, and results in Aries' key falling into the hands of Angel, who not only is a villain, but is no less cruel than Karen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> The heroes face a typical "Which life do we save?" situation, when both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Erwin, commander of the Survey Corps</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Armin, who's Mikasa and Eren's childhood friend</span> are dying and only one of them can be saved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren and Mikasa</span> forcefully argue in favor of the latter, and while they are biased, they also point out some valid contributions that this person has made, although it is also argued that the former individual's contributions are greater. Ultimately, the choice is made to save the latter individual, in part because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Levi realizes that Erwin was actually relieved at the prospect of facing death</span>, and it is successful, but the individual questions whether it was worth the sacrifice, and no one present can say anything much more encouraging than that he'll have to prove it was.
</li><li> The Warriors' motivations also fall into this category. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They hail from a nation where their people live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto">Fantastic Ghetto</a>, and have volunteered to serve Marley in hopes of earning better treatment. This required them to inherit one of the Nine Titans, a process that shortens their lifespan to 13 years and dooms them to become a living weapon for the military. And their attack on the Walls was because they were raised to believe the people living there were "children of the devil" ....and even after learning this isn't the case, they decide to continue on with their mission in hopes of saving their people. Nearly a decade after volunteering and sacrificing their lives, their families are <em>still</em> living in the ghetto and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Reiner</a> helplessly watches as his younger cousin is groomed to become his successor</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>
<ul><li> Kuroyukihime, with a well-chosen taunt and skillful use of Brain Burst, goads Araya, who's bullying Kuroyukihime's new friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Haruyuki</a>, into punching Haruyuki and knocking him into her in full view of the social cameras, finally getting Araya caught in the act and placed on suspension. Unfortunately, a vengeful Araya steals a car and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">tries to kill Kuroyukihime and Haruyuki in retaliation</a>, causing Kuroyukihime, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">blames herself for what happened</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice almost all her points and almost lose her life to save Haruyuki</a>.
</li><li> In the manga adaptation, Taku ends up briefly falling into this trope before being talked out of it.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">An added scene</a> has Chiyu and Kuroyukihime play a virtual doubles tennis match against Haru and Taku as a test; if Chiyu's team wins, Taku will install Brain Burst on her. After Chiyu and Kuroyukihime win the first set 40-0, Kuroyukihime accuses the boys of holding back. She realizes that Taku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetYouWin">is willing to let Chiyu win</a> in order to grant Chiyu's desire to become a Burst Linker. Kuroyukihime says she understands how Taku feels, but says he can't simply let her win out of kindness, but has to take the test seriously for her sake. Taku gets the point, resulting in him and Haru narrowly winning the second set, before being beaten in the third and final set.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Doflamingo's father, Saint Homing, chooses to leave the World Nobles and live as an ordinary person to teach his sons how to live. While his intentions are good, since we've seen the kind of people the World Nobles turn out to be, in practice, it ends up forcing his family to live in poverty, and in danger from those who have grudges against the World Nobles, since the Donquixotes are no longer protected. Homing comes to regret his decision, making an unsuccessful attempt to get his sons reinstated as nobles, and he ultimately loses his life when Doflamingo (who's learned nothing from the experience) kills him in a vain attempt to return to the nobility.
</li><li> At the end of the "Southern Cross" section of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a>,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zor Prime sacrifices his life to stop the Robotech Masters, but in so doing only scatters the spores of the Flower of Life <em>everywhere,</em> guaranteeing that the Invid will come and attack the Earth.</span> From a meta standpoint, this is particularly harsh because in the original, pre-<em>Robotech</em> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross</a>,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Seifriet Weiße</span>'s sacrifice was <em>not</em> in vain and did save the day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako">Shirobako</a></em>, Shigeru Sugie, a veteran animator, notices that Ema Yasuhara, a newbie, is less than confident in herself, since she doesn't know if she'll ever be able to make a living off of animating. Sugie advises Ema to focus on learning how to get her work done more quickly while she's young, saying that if she does, she'll naturally improve in other regards. Possibly as a result of this, Ema deviates from her usual style, which results in her having to redo some of her cuts, and Segawa's harsh criticism of Ema's latest work worsens Ema's fears that she doesn't have what it takes to be an animator. Sugie's goal was to help her do better and become more confident, but in the short term, his advice backfired, at least as a result of how Ema chose to follow it.

</li><li> <em>My Two Mommies</em>:
<ul><li> Himari, the protagonist, feeds a stray cat named Shiro near her school, despite her classmate Kanda complaining about her doing so. One day, Himari finds a kitten at Shiro's usual spot, and realizes that Shiro was pregnant. Kanda then reveals that Shiro abandoned her kitten, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls out Himari</a>, saying this happens when she irresponsibly feeds strays but doesn't take care of the kittens. Himari, guilt-stricken, then decides to help Kanda take care of Shiro's kitten.
</li><li> Some time later, Kanda reveals that she fell into this trope herself. She volunteered to help raise cats when she was younger, hoping to reduce the number of abandoned cats. Despite her efforts, she noticed that people continued to abandon pets, hoping that volunteers like her would take care of them, and concluded that her volunteer work wasn't helping.

Since all of his family and friends are embroiled in the supernatural, they end up avoiding Ichigo entirely and isolate him for <em>two years</em> so they won't talk about it around him. Ichigo gets the impression that his loved ones only wanted him when he had powers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairWeatherFriend">don't want him around</a> since they don't need him anymore.

Which in turn causes relationships within the group to splinter and Soul Society to be whipped into frenzy trying to find him.
</li><li> This trope is often played around with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Gensokyo20XX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Gensokyo20XX">Gensokyo 20XX</a></em> series, especially with Yukari's choices, namely being the warden's lover (20XXII), leaving Reimu to find Ran, Chen, and Flandre (20XXI), and, locking Reimu in a room when her mind goes south (20XXV). However, she did note that to do the alternative would be worst and that in the 20XXII and 20XXV cases that she wouldn't have done them if she really had a choice.
<ul><li> In 20XXI, we have the instance Chen was blinded by a well-intentioned stranger who didn't wish to turn her into the youkai hunters, figuring that, if she was blind, then they will not go after her but that put her at the mercy of otherwise seen dangers that she could have avoided. This is virtually summed up in this quote from Chapter 15:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Blinding her, well-intentioned in motives? Yes. Foolish? Most definitely."
</div><ul><li> From 20XXIV, after Chen is attacked and left incontinent and with her left arm and leg paralyzed, Kaguya, with the reluctant help of Mokou, go to take revenge on whom she sees as responsible (a group of antagonistic kitsune) and it results in their house being burned down, causing everyone to go somewhere else.

That said, while the protagonists consider killing Ozai to rectify this mistake and thwart a possible coup, it's also believed that doing so would undermine Zuko's legitimacy as Fire Lord, which largely comes from not being like his father.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheOutside">The Outside</a></em>, we have something of a lesser version of this, as Satsuki does mean well and genuinely wants to care for Ryuuko but, due to not being exactly mentally well and having iffy ideas of what that looks like, it's clear she's not a capable guardian for her and, so, she loses custody, sending the latter to foster care.

Perhaps the best example is when he finds a race of beings so utterly ugly that they constantly weep. He wishes for them to become beautiful and always laugh, but it turns out that their tears are actually necessary. The book also contains a variation, in that Bastian frequently commits acts that, while seemingly benevolent in nature, are motivated more by a desire to look good rather than do good, or because he thinks he'll benefit in some way from it. The narration notes that a person's reasons for an act can be just as important as the act itself.

He goes nuts, calls in every ally he can get, makes a dangerous deal with the Faerie Queen Mab, and then kills<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the entire Red Court, stopping a dangerous war that had killed thousands of humans and wiping out an entire nation of nasty monsters</span>.

<ul><li> The destruction of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Red Court</span> has created a colossal power vacuum which many power-hungry factions are eager to fill, creating even more conflict and chaos.

After Warsaw is freed by the Race, the Jews cooperate with them in order to survive, and are seen as traitors to humanity by doing so. The fact that attempts to condemn the Race for their actions such as destroying Washington D.C. are altered and turned into praises don't help.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Valar</a> were motivated to things like bringing the Elves to the Undying Lands or rewarding the Edain with Númenor entirely by good intentions. The text still takes the time to strongly imply that doing so was ultimately the wrong thing to do.
<ul><li> In Tolkien's legendarium, trying to impose <em>any</em> vision or much of anything else on the world is likely to end badly, because the free wills and free choices of Elves and Men are so vital, and because no finite entity comprehends enough of How Things Work in the universe to be able to predict the consequences of their actions outside their purview. Tolkien had a low opinion both of reactionaries ('Embalmers') and progressives ('Reformers'), Sauron started out as a Reformer, the Elves of Eregion who made the Rings were Embalmers. Both were Not Quite the Right Thing.
</li><li> <em>The Silmarillion</em> brings this into play a lot. The whole family of Húrin, but especially Túrin's life is this (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Morgoth</a> cursed the whole family into this) for example.

Harry is horrified at the idea that he might have helped Voldemort on his way back to power, but Dumbledore consoles him that he only did the best he could at the time. He also notes that Wormtail owes Harry his life, which may come in useful in the future.
<ul><li> Sure enough, it finally pays off in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>: when Wormtail tries to strangle Harry, the latter reminds him that he owes Harry his life.

<ul><li> Ned Stark finds himself in <em>several</em> situations in which being just <em>slightly</em> less scrupulously moral could have had things turn out much better for him. Among them:
<ul><li> When he warns Cersei that he has discovered that her children are bastards and plans to tell King Robert. His intention is to give her the chance to flee with her children, since he (almost certainly correctly) believes that Robert will kill the children when he finds out. Instead, it simply gives her ample warning and time to move her own plans forward.
</li><li> Later, shortly after Robert's death, Renly Baratheon offers to support him as Lord Regent if he'll take Cersei's children hostage to ensure that she doesn't move against them (and strongly implies that he expects Ned's support for his claim to the throne in return). Ned might have accepted Renly's help and supported his claim, accepted his help and then later refused his claim in favor of Stannis, accepted his help on the condition that he renounce his claim, or refused his help but taken his advice to seize the children. Instead, he refuses the help, the claim, <em>and</em> the advice, meaning that he has no support and no leverage when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Littlefinger betrays him and sides with the Lannisters</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the more tragic examples is Robb Stark's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> downfall; he has been an unstoppable military threat in the War of Five Kings, and the Lannisters are at their wits' end trying to figure out any way to take him on in the battlefield, but then he is "comforted" by a young noble girl while recovering from a wound after one of his conquests. Robb is immediately caught in a dilemma between "doing the right thing" and marrying the girl whose virginity he just took (as he is in a medieval-style world, where without her virginity a girl will, at best, have much lower prospects for marriage and be judged her whole life, or be tremendously shamed and shipped out to a nunnery at worst), or "doing the right thing" and honoring his betrothal to a Frey girl. Robb decides the girl's honor takes precedence over his own and marries her, which results in the Freys betraying him, murdering him and most of his followers, and desecrating his corpse.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Of course, the Freys themselves, and their powerful ally Roose Bolton, were already planning on betraying Robb, given the Freys reluctant support, and Roose's undercutting of the war effort.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Daenerys Targaryen breathes this trope. She desperately wants to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">best kind of Targaryen</a>, and she makes many decisions that are, at root, both heartfelt and from the moral highlands by many readers' lights. Heck, from an outside perspective, more than a few could arguably lead to a better-run, more economically viable region, <em>if</em> properly researched, planned, implemented and integrated. Unfortunately, Targaryens have this noted... tilt... towards a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">go now, go big or go home</a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadnessPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMadnessPlace">The Madness Place</a>/ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a> approach when it comes to politics, economics and social engineering, and Dany is also having to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">play a lot by ear from a moment-to-moment basis</a> both just to stay alive and to get anywhere while doing so. So, yeah: understandable levels of insufficient risk assessment occur. On top of that, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Westeros and Essos are too culturally different</a> (and her worldview is also initially too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White</a>-and-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat">sheltered-all-over</a> when contrasted with the more nuanced, sociopolitical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grayscale</a> around her) for almost <em>anything</em> she does to try pushing her agendas to have even close to the expected outcomes in either the medium or longer terms. And, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">it rarely goes well</a>: for example, you'd think <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> trying to rid Slaver's Bay of slavery to be a fundamentally good thing all around, right? Nope: the resulting economic and social collapse that leads to several bloodbaths, what amounts to a budding world war <em>and</em> a pandemic later when trying to do it in only a few months with little-to-no cross-class backing... is kind of hinted at in the millennia-old name of the place. Slave liberation by an outsider needs way more prep work than she put in, in short.</span>
</li><li> Jaime Lannister has a long, complicated and incredibly painful relationship with this trope, one about as much of a rollercoaster as the one with with his sister (who often has something to do with the complexities in both). A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> joining the Kingsguard against his father's wishes, but to "do the right/honourable thing" by both his king and maybe-future queen (and beloved sister)? That... backfired. Killing the Mad King for what basically was the greater good? Oh, boy; what a mess. Protecting his lover and kids by throwing a preteen boy off a tower? Duuuuuuuuude. Trying to protect the Stark girls... while still backing his father (who would rather they conveniently died after getting used to cement alliances)? Um. Finally coming clean to his brother about a huge family secret at the worst emotional and political point imaginable? Oops. Cleaning up the Riverlands and reinstating the rule of law (or what passes for it) on behalf of the Iron Throne; you know, this being the same place you earlier actively helped to destabilize on behalf of said Throne? Good luck with that!

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>. CSI in general (all three shows) has a strong thread of ironic justice running through it. Almost any time a character either breaks the law to bring someone else to justice (say, by planting evidence or searching without a warrant), or kills someone because the law can't punish them for their crimes, it will backfire. Anyone killed out of a sense of "justice" will turn out to have been innocent the entire time, and the killer will always wind up devastated over what they've done. Criminals framed for a crime or illegally arrested will turn out to be innocent as well, potentially resulting in the person doing the frame losing everything in the process. Crime absolutely does not pay - regardless of the reasons - in the CSIverse. Some specific examples include:
<ul><li> In the episode "Feeling the Heat" a couple euthanize their child upon seeing symptoms of Tay Sachs, a painful degenerative disease to which they had already lost another child (disguising it as the husband accidentally leaving him in the car on a hot day; itself an example because it opens him up to being arrested for neglect). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out that the child was healthy. For added irony the symptoms were caused by exposure to the very weedkiller they poisoned him with.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in one episode where the father of a missing girl planted an already-dead body he stole inside the chimney of the man he suspected of killing said daughter in order to put police suspicion on him after failing to convince them just with his words (and planting the man's son's ID on it as pure revenge<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15llt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15llt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15llt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hoping that briefly thinking his son would dead would put him through the same pain he's gone through</span>). His plan succeeded spectacularly, as his dead daughter's body was <em>also</em> hidden in a brick extension to the chimney in question (and, as an added bonus, the villain tries to pin it on his apparently dead son, who overhears the entire thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">and disowns him</a>). Considering the judge limited the initial warrant to the chimney the man not only made his own luck but hit the jackpot with it, making this overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: Dany frees a great deal of younger oppressed slaves and incorporates them into her followers. The willing ones seem to make a cult of personality out of her. The only problem being that other classes of bondsmen have taken the opportunity to either become cruel dictators themselves or otherwise allowed their former masters to enslave them again without any complaint since they know of little else, meaning her crusade to end slavery has actually <em>worsened</em> the situation, despite being a morally good course of action. It gets even worse later on, mostly due to the writers making everything easier for her so they could quickly get through the storyline. After taking down the majority of her enemies in Slaver's Bay, she just <em>leaves</em> for Westoros during this unstable economic state. Not before she leaves her mercenary boyfriend in charge, as if he has <em>any</em> knowledge of administrating a city, let alone an entire region! After Season Six, nothing is mentioned about whether the "Bay of Dragons" is doing well or not, so for all we know, it's already on the brink of collapse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em>': During one episode, Max gets a call from 99 while he and the Chief are in the middle of a shootout with KAOS agents. When he expresses surprise that she's home early from her assigned mission, she happily tells him that she fooled the KAOS agents who were following her by sending them on a wild goose chase to pier 47. Max (who's <em>at</em> pier 47) ruefully wishes she had sent them to pier 50 instead.
</li><li> This happens in the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> where he is institutionalized; House chews out the doctor who forced a delusional patient to confront the fact that he was not actually a super hero (then went catatonic). House ends up trying to "help" the guy and only makes things worse. But he eventually learns a lesson about the difference between trying to "fix" things and actually just apologizing.

One of the best if not <em>the</em> best TOS episodes, combining the grey areas of real world moral choice with a harsh lesson in the nasty implications of time travel, and also an implicit rebuke to the idea that love conquers all. Kirk was very much in love with Edith, she was not just a pretty skirt he was chasing... but that <em>didn't matter</em>. What was necessary was necessary. Spock's emotionless act is transparently undercut by the genuine sympathy and pity in his simple, dry statement to McCoy, "He knows, Doctor. He knows."
</li><li> The re-imagined <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> does this ALL the time. From Colonial One's abandoning of the civilian ships in the miniseries to the <em>Olympic Carrier</em> to mutiny to military dictatorships to banning abortion to baby-stealing to torture to assassination to suicide-bombing to election-rigging - the characters (mainly Commander/Admiral Adama and President Roslin) constantly wrestle with the decision to do the <em>easy</em> thing or the <em>right</em> thing. And they actually make crappy decisions a good deal of the time.
<ul><li> Abandoning the ships in miniseries turns out to be tragically right, though. And it's not like they had any choice (those ships didn't have any FTL engines, and would never have been able to escape the Cylons anyway).

<ul><li> In "Genesis of the Daleks", the Doctor is tasked with destroying or altering the behavior of the Daleks so as to make them a negligible threat. The Doctor, however, realizes that by doing so, he would rob the different races of the universe of a chance to end warring amongst themselves, as countless civilizations put aside their differences to band together in grand coalitions against the Daleks, learning to work together in harmony along the way.
</li><li> Many centuries later in the Doctor's timeline in "The Magician's Apprentice"/"The Witch's Familiar" two-parter, the action starts when his twelfth self is about to rescue a frightened young boy from an unconventional minefield — then he learns that the boy is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Davros, who grew up to create the Daleks</span>. The Doctor decides to simply leave the boy to his fate (leaving the sonic screwdriver behind) instead of saving him, but it doesn't take long for him to realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this probably started Davros on the path to evil</span>; in the present, he seeks to atone for this — perhaps with his own life.

Oma Desala comments that the universe is an infinitely complicated place full of unforseeable consequences which an individual can't control, but they can control whether they themselves are good or evil.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> episode "Sunday", a couple of personnel get infected with tumors that explode like bombs. When the team finds out about the tumors, one of the personnel is already in surgery for injuries sustained when the first person blew up. Sheppard calls Dr. Beckett and orders him to evacuate himself and his staff before the man explodes, but Beckett refuses to abandon his patient to die. One of his nurses stays with him to help remove the explosive tumor, which Beckett then takes to the waiting EOD technicians. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Just as Beckett hands off the tumor to the bomb squad guy, it blows up, killing both of them.</span> There would have been one less fatality if Beckett had just followed Sheppard's orders.

By contrast, Al Swearengen hasn't an honorable bone in his body, but he's got enough self-interest, moral flexibility (and just enough compassion) to help the town immeasurably.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>, Barry accidentally time travels to the previous day.

Instead of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being killed by Wells/Thawne for unmasking him</span>, Cisco is kidnapped by the Rogues along with his brother and is forced to rebuild their weapons. Cold then forces Cisco to reveal the Flash's identity, which Cold uses to blackmail Barry into letting the Rogues operate without interference.
</li><li> Pops up frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>. It would seem to be the right thing to do to help a mother look for her missing child or give a lost teenager a ride or help a woman load her wheelchair into her van. Until it turns out that those people are serial killers, and by helping them, you've unwittingly become their next victim or endangered others.
<ul><li> Subverted in one episode. Morgan interviews an inmate at the request of the parole board. After reviewing his prison record and talking with him, Morgan advises that he's been rehabilitated and deserves to be released. Less than 24 hours later, he's been arrested for a new murder. Only, upon investigation, it turns out that he was innocent in the first place and this new crime is self-defense after confronting one of the men responsible for framing him in the first place.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Declaring Exterminatus on a planet is generally a delicate matter, as it involves the total and complete annihilation of an entire planet's population. In theory, it's used when they cannot be saved from Chaos or genestealer infection, and this outweighs the planet's benefits (in terms of providing men, materiel or resources), but unfortunately what with Chaos plots and Inquisitors going rogue/falling to Chaos, there are quite a few occasions where Exterminatus merely furthered the enemy's plans.
</li><li> Kryptmann's Gambit: an extreme version of the above dilemma, in which Inquisitor Kryptmann managed to bait an entire Hive Fleet away from countless inhabited worlds by... getting them to go for other inhabited worlds which he Exterminus'ed before they fell, denying the Tyranids the biomass they needed to replenish their losses. Finally the fleet was weak enough that it could be stuck in a stalemate with the ork system of Octarius, at the cost of Kryptmann's standing (he's been declared Excommunicate Traitoris), several trillion people and (much more importantly) several inhabitable planets. Also, the fact that Octarius is now in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between the two species with the most to gain from it: tyranids devour biomass to create new lifeforms (usually better adapted to whatever they're fighting), while orks create spores when they die that mature into more orks. And orks pour into the system all the time, having heard about the fight to be had. Whichever side wins the war will be essentially unstoppable. This later gets another wrinkle when Ghazgul joins the fight and his leadership turns it into another Armageddon-style eternal stalemate; these massive battles become foci of WAAAGH energy, and every Ork in the galaxy is being empowered by it.

While this seems like a good thing, according to the epilogue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dagna's research deeply explores how lyrium contributes to magic, giving the Circle an excuse to set up a semi-independent group in Orzammar. However, the Chantry becomes enraged at the prospect of Orzammar harboring mages not under their control, seriously straining the relations between the Chantry and Orzammar</span>. The negative effects can only be avoided by mage warden under the right circumstances.
</li><li> Shows up in the quest where a dwarf tries to establish a Chantry presence in Orzammar. If you help him do this, the epilogue reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">resentment of the Chantry's presence eventually sparks mass riots throughout the city. The leader of the Orzammar Chantry, who happens to be the dwarf you helped, is killed in these riots, further straining relations with the Chantry to the point that they are seriously considering launching an Exalted March (ie <em>holy war</em>) against Orzammar</span>.
</li><li> In order to get any support from Orzammar, you need to ensure that one of two candidates for kingship takes the throne. One candidate is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Lord Harrowmont</a>, a fairly good natured man who is said to have been chosen by the former king himself as the successor. The other is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">Prince Bhelen</a>, the remaining son of the former king, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> correctly</span> suspected of killing his older brother and framing his other sibling (possibly main character) among other shady schemes for the throne. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Choosing Harrowmont results in Orzammar closing itself off from the surface world and strengthening the already oppressive caste system. Choosing Bhelen results in Orzammar becoming a benevolent dictatorship, opening up to others, taking back some lost land, and eventually abolishing the caste system.</span> Yeah, this game loves it some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>. Then again, the game does show that Bhelen is a progressive wanting to stop Orzammar's slow death while Harrowmont is a traditionalist to the point of stagnation.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> During Samara's recruitment mission, you come across an Eclipse merc willing to surrender and who is practically begging for her life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> You can let her live, despite her going for a gun, but you'll find an audio log that reveals that she was the one who murdered the Volus merchant, and that she took sadistic pleasure in it as well. A perceptive player might deduce this, as she's wearing an Eclipse uniform and all recruits must commit at least one murder before being allowed a uniform.</span> Ultimately, however, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>: If you listen to the news afterwords (the same news that talks about Blasto), they say that she was arrested.
</li><li> The suicide mission is another example when picking roles for the squad members. Usually, who to pick is obvious (for example it's obviously a bad idea to pick Jacob for hacking the doors open despite him volunteering because as Miranda points out, you need a tech expert. Jack and Samara are obvious biotic badasses who can easily hold up a biotic field against seeker swarms, though despite her comments, Miranda isn't). But there's a couple of seemingly good choices that could come as a nasty surprise to the player, as well as a seemingly bad choice that actually works. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zaeed Massani seems at first glance like he'd be perfect to lead the fire team. Didn't he help co-found the Blue Suns? And doesn't he always survive when getting into fights? <em>But</em>, a fire team leader can't succeed unless he also protects his team, and Zaeed has a history of <em>getting his team killed.</em> Let's also hope you didn't interpret Thane's rapid analysis of the Citadel's weakpoints and security as squad-worthy tactical awareness; he's an assassin, and thus used to working alone. Likewise, some players might pick Mordin to go through the vents and hack the doors open; isn't he a genius? <em>But</em>, Mordin's expertise is entirely in the life sciences; he has no <em>computer</em> experience at all. As for the seemingly bad choice, when Miranda volunteers to lead the fire team, Jack will complain that nobody trusts her, or if Jack was killed by the Occulus laser Garrus will raise the complaint instead. <em>But</em>, as Miranda said, it's not a popularity contest. Miranda has years of leadership experience, so Jack and Garrus' objections notwithstanding, she <em>is</em> a good fire team leader choice!</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: Since this is the game where all your choices come together, it's natural that there are some cases of this. Usually it's the "heroic" (i.e. Paragon) decisions that pay off, but there are some exceptions.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Some players wanted to avoid genocide against geth by rewriting the heretic geth in Mass Effect 2, but that actually makes peace between quarians and geth <em>harder</em> as the rewritten geth join the forces fighting the quarians. Of course if you succeed anyway or side with the Geth, that's more war assets for you.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also, if you destroyed the Collector Base instead of saving it, you get a weaker War Asset from the Cerberus base than you would have if you'd preserved the base (although doing so also makes destroying the Reapers instead of controlling them easier).</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As the Extended Cut ending DLC reveals in one of its slides, if you cured the genophage with Wreav as the leader instead of Wrex, Wreav gathers a huge krogan army to make war on the galaxy, a point Shepard can touch on if convincing Mordin to fake curing the genophage if Wrex and Eve are dead.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The only way to get both Salarian as well as Krogan support is by killing Wrex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> and letting Eve die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> - that way, the Krogan are led by the warlike Wreav without the tempering influence of the wise woman; which in turn enables you to convince the salarian scientist (Mordin or his replacement) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> to fake curing the genophage. If you provided the Krogans with a competent leadership, the scientist won't play along and rat you out to the Krogans should you decide to sabotage the genophage cure, resulting in them withdrawing their support to the war effort, if you did cure the genophage, the Salarians will withdraw theirs.</span>
</li><li> You can also approve a soldier's transfer to the fight against the Reapers, so that she can avoid possibly having to kill her brother in Cerberus. However, your war assets will take a hit as Alliance forces take casualties from a lack of engineers in the fight against Cerberus. Detail-oriented players may have noticed the N7: Cerberus Lab mission contains journal entries from the soldier's brother. They reveal he's already been "integrated", which erased his personality, and it's possible he's one of the mooks you killed in that mission anyway.
</li><li> There's an asari with post-traumatic stress disorder you can overhear telling her story to a counselor. Eventually she begs to have a gun, and since you-as-Shepard have Spectre authority, you can use the Spectre Terminal to authorize giving her a gun. But if you do that, she kills herself, and this traumatizes the medical workers to such an extent that your War Assets take a hit as the doctors' minds aren't completely on the job.
</li><li> Putting pressure on a dock officer to allow more refugees into the Citadel will decrease the value of your Citadel Defense Force war asset due to an overflow of refugees.
</li><li> Not taking the Renegade Option when speaking to Kelly Chambers (advising her to change her identity) will result in her being executed by Cerberus troops during the invasion of the Citadel.
</li><li> If you side with Tali during her argument with Admiral Xen (pressuring Xen into using her research ships to search for survivors rather than salvage the remains of the Geth dreadnought), you will lose out on a pretty hefty War Asset for the Crucible.
</li><li> Taking the Paragon option and letting Javik touch the memory shard will cause him to decide to kill himself once the war is over.

<ul><li> Convincing Arcade to fight alongside the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Remnants</span> against Caesar in the NCR and Legion endings results in him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being branded a war criminal and hunted down due to his revealing his Enclave affiliation</span>.
</li><li> Going for the Independence ending results in the Followers of the Apocalypse being flooded beyond capacity by new patients due to the massive increase in mayhem and dismemberment caused by the resulting power vacuum.
</li><li> For the Brotherhood of Steel questline, the current Elder McNamara has kept the whole bunker on lockdown for years, seeming to be a sign of the Brotherhood's stagnancy. You can play kingmaker for a successor, Hardin, who wants to lift the lockdown. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out Hardin simply wanted to lift the lockdown so they could start mugging Wastelanders for their pre-war tech without restraint. McNamara was actually one of the <em>most</em> progressive members of the Brotherhood, who ends the lockdown as soon as he gets proper evidence that it was safe to do so and can be convinced to make peace with the NCR—something Hardin completely refuses.</span>
</li><li> <em>Honest Hearts</em> features one of these in both outcomes of the final choice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helping Daniel evacuate the Sorrows saves more people from dying, but Zion — one of the last fertile and non-nuked areas in the world — is destroyed by the now-unopposed White Legs.

He's rigged up his lair's sprinklers to disperse irradiated water, which he originally did to provide an extra "power up" for himself and the then-sentient ghouls who lived there with him. Unfortunately, as experienced players know, an overabundance of radiation is one of the theories about <em>why</em> ghouls turn feral. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And this is brought up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in the suicide note you can find on the body of Oswald's dead girlfriend. Confronting him with the possibility that he might have been the one who inadvertently turned his friends into incurably insane mindless monsters will cause him to break down and abandon the place, allowing you to clear him out without having to kill him.</span>

</li><li> A girl is attacked and badly wounded by a griffin and expected to die despite the village healer's best efforts.

There are a number of points in the game in which the heroes are given a choice of two actions; one obviously "good" and one obviously "bad". The "bad" morality choices usually turn out exactly as you would expected. The subversion/deconstruction comes in the fact that the "good" morality choice almost always has a completely unforeseeable, incredibly negative consequence in the future, often as bad or even worse than what would have if you made the "bad" choice, which the heroes never even become aware of and which is only revealed to the player by the narrator.
<ul><li> As an example, the first morality choice you get in the game is to kill another mercenary who's been helping you, or to pretend to kill him and tell him to disappear. If you kill him, he dies. If you let him live, he escapes Shanghai before all the shit goes down, and moves to a quiet tropical island...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">where he's killed by an assassin while sleeping on a beach lounger</a>.
<ul><li> That being said, the point of the morality choices in the game are that you can't control anything beyond the choices <em>you</em> make: Rios and Salem aren't bad guys, and they aren't good guys. They're just guys in the middle of a chaotic situation trying to do what they think is right in the moment. Whether it works out later is beyond the scope of their choice, and they really don't <em>care</em> one way or the other what happens after they part ways: they have their own problems to deal with. In other words, it's personal morality vs. omniscient morality.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol">Alpha Protocol</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Rome, you will be given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> of saving your friend or defusing bombs that threaten to kill dozens, if not hundreds, of people. If you choose to save the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>, the bombs go off. If you defuse the bombs, she is shot dead in front of you. From a purely utilitarian perspective, defusing the bombs is obviously the right thing to do, since many more people will die if they go off. The epilogue reveals that, either way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">whoever dies becomes a symbol for the movement to enact harsh new anti-terrorism laws (which was the villain's goal all along)</a>. However, if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> lives, she becomes a grassroots political figure in the movement to oppose them.
<ul><li> To elaborate: if the bombs go off, Europe uses this incident to increase its anti-terrorism laws. If Madison dies, then <em>America</em> uses her death to increase its anti-terrorism laws (which isn't actually the villains' goal with the operation, but certainly does not harm their interests), and nobody has come up to the plate to oppose them.
</li></ul></li><li> In Taiwan, your choice is to save the President from being assassinated or prevent a violent riot that could kill hundreds of people. Again, from a utilitarian perspective, the gain of keeping the region stable and preventing a Taiwanese/Chinese arms escalation by preserving the President's life may outweigh the civilian life cost, but saving him actually leads to worsened Taiwan/China relations since he uses his increased popularity with the public to push for official Taiwanese independence. If you let him die and instead focus on stopping the riots, the riots are stopped cold and nobody else dies, and the President is replaced with a pro-reunification successor who defrosts Taiwan's relationship with China by starting reunification talks and more or less killing the Taiwanese pro-independence movement (and thus possibly costing the U.S. an ally in the long run).
</li><li> Ultimately, it turns out that there <em>is</em> no completely right choice in <em>Alpha Protocol</em>. At the end of the game, regardless of the choices you've made, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the bad guy's plan succeeds and global tensions are increased almost to the point of a new cold war</span>. However, the choices that you make can ultimately influence the ending in important ways: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if you're able to prove that Alpha Protocol and Halbech are behind the increased tensions by saving the lives of key individuals and preventing the evidence from being destroyed as a result, then world tensions are implied to decrease</span>. Alternatively, you can make things much better or much worse in the epilogue based on the choices you make. Getting to the endgame, though, is a foregone conclusion, regardless of what you decide.
</li><li> An unintentional one is the result of a never-fixed bug. One Russian mission involves infiltrating a building, which depending on a previous choices is either guarded by local rent-a-cops or US marines. If you can't talk your way in and non-violently sneak in (or talk your way in and open the wrong door), the ending flag that gets triggered is that you massacred the marines even if they weren't there. This destroys any chance at the best endings since your word and evidence associated with you is now worthless.

<ul><li> In the 5th trial, a student makes a claim that is very obviously a lie, and you have easy means to prove it. Considering revealing lies in testimonies is what you've been doing the entire game until this point, and that the only other suspect in the case is <em>the</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a></em>, revealing the lie seems like the obvious choice, but doing this leads to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Bad Ending.</a> Despite resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>the main character being voted guilty and sentenced to execution</em></span>, <em>not</em> revealing the lie actually ends up being the best choice for everyone.
</li><li> In the third chapter, Makoto takes Taka to see Alter Ego, against Kyoko's wishes- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alter Ego's creator, Chihiro, had just been murdered by Taka's best friend Mondo, so Taka was hoping for some way to apologize to Chihiro and ease his conscience, since he blames himself for what happened. During the meeting, Alter Ego then takes on Mondo's appearance and mannerisms, causing Taka to break out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and become the incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> "Kiyondo," as well as becoming a bit obsessed with Alter Ego. This turn of events, and Kiyondo's resulting rivalry with Hifumi, enable Celeste to put a plan for murder into action, manipulating Hifumi into killing Kiyondo, then killing Hifumi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a nasty example of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DateWarp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DateWarp">Date Warp</a></em>. If the player-as-Janet is doing Nathaniel's route, at one point Janet reads the diary of Bianca, Nathaniel's old girlfriend. From the diary Janet learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before she started dating Nathaniel, Bianca slept around with multiple men for fun</span>. Naturally, players hoping to win Nathaniel's heart will be tempted to reveal the contents of the diary to Nathaniel, after all, Nathaniel practically worshiped Bianca when she was alive, shouldn't he be told something so important? Oh, and what a bonus, it would open up space for Janet in his heart...well, <em>not quite</em>. See, if you actually tell Nathaniel about the diary, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he incredulously wonders what makes you think he didn't <em>already know about this</em>. Actually, he and Bianca talked about this like grown-ups as they were dating, and Nathaniel decided he didn't care so they could move on. Janet on the other hand is a <em>child</em> because she was snooping in someone else's private diary and tattling on the writer.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DreamDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DreamDaddy">Dream Daddy</a></em>, you can tumble (or get tumbled by) Robert on your first night in the neighborhood, but doing so means he stops seeing you as a potential romantic interest, locking out his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding">Good Ending</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, during the Heaven's Feel route, the protagonist faces the choice of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Sakura, an innocent abuse victim who he loves, or sparing her and risking her killing innocent people entirely unintentionally</span>. The former choice has Shirou emulating his foster father Kiritsugu and killing his emotions to do what's "right"...and severely disappointing Ilya (who was previously <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">abandoned by Kiritsugu, her father</span>) and Rin (who is then forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill her sister</span>), with the implication being that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he will eventually kill them <em>too</em></span>. Even the Tiger Dojo inhabitants are speechless. And the one person with congratulations happens to take pleasure in the suffering of others... The latter choice also cannot be considered the 'right' thing because while you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spare an innocent</span>, it results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura being saved, but only after unconsciously devouring many people and putting the world in danger</span>.
</li><li> There's a minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em>. Usually the choices to get the girls' routes are pretty obvious. But there's a case in Makoto's route where the player might make an understandable screw-up: on January 23rd, first the player needs to look for Amano Mishio... but the next correct choice is to leave without talking to Mishio. The player's first instinct would be to talk to Mishio since Mishio is Makoto's friend, but that's the wrong choice because it won't get you the information you need on this particular day. You need to talk to Mishio <em>later</em>, when she herself is more willing to talk to you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters">Little Busters!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Komari's route, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Komari starts mentally deteriorating because she realized that she did in fact have a big brother after all, which she forgot on her dying brother's advice since the memory of his loss was so painful. Then Komari starts to use the player character, Riki, as a "surrogate". Given Komari's nasty mental state and how much the truth would break her, it's understandable if the player chooses that yes, Riki will pretend to be Komari's big brother. But doing that means Komari remains in a dream forever, leading to a Bad Ending. To get Komari's good ending you have to tell Komari the truth no matter how painful it is. It hurts Komari at first but then she and Riki end up romantically involved.</span>
</li><li> Kurugaya's route starts with some girls harassing Riki by sticking thumbtacks in his shoes. When Kurugaya asks Riki what's bothering him, he can either tell her the truth, or keep her in the dark. It would be safe to assume that telling her the truth is the best option, but doing so leads to an early bad end. Instead, he must keep Kurugaya in the dark about the situation, though she still ends up figuring out about the girls who were harassing Riki.
</li><li> Early on in Haruka's route, Riki learns which class she's in because of Kanata. When Haruka asks how he learned which class she's in, he can either tell her the truth or lie and say he checked the faculty office. Similar to what happens with Kurugaya, Riki's supposed to lie instead of tell Haruka the truth, as she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up depressed and assumes that Riki, the one thing she had that her sister Kanata didn't, would prefer Kanata over her</span>.
</li><li> In Kud's route, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riki is given the choice of letting Kud go back to her homeland, or asking her to stay in Japan. It's understandable why one would pick letting her stay, as Tevua is in the middle of an armed conflict and the land is engulfed in riots. However, asking Kud to stay results in a Bad Ending where her relationship with Riki remains stagnant, and with her witnessing the execution of her mother on a live news broadcast</span>.
</li><li> An example occurs in Haruka's route that isn't connected to player choices, but rather the decision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanata made when she was a kid to lie about an allergy to eggs. She did it when her and Haruka's extended family forced them to compete against each other by comparing their cooking skills, and did so because she didn't want Haruka to face even more abuse from their family. However, the family thought that Haruka was trying to induce an allergic reaction to harm Kanata, so she faced even worse beatings than usual</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The player's first instincts are probably wrong when playing Mayu's or Mizuka's routes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/OneKagayakuKisetsuE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/OneKagayakuKisetsuE">One Kagayaku Kisetsu E</a></em>. This is because in Mayu's route, you need to keep pushing her to do things <em>other</em> than what she wants so that Mayu will move past her animal-like behavior. And in Mizuka's route, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> choices are the right ones, even the choice that leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mizuka in a dark room with random men copping a feel</span>. Why? Because in order to become involved with Mizuka, Kouhei has to stop taking her for granted, and he only does that if he realizes that Mizuka loves him so much she'll put up with him even when he's a jerk.
</li><li> There's a more merciful example of this trope than usual in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em>. In the DS-exclusive fifth case to the first game in the series, Phoenix Wright recovers a piece of cloth cut from a murder victim's chest, which appears to be crucial evidence Phoenix Wright needs. Then Damon Gant, the police chief whose safe you took this evidence from, says he knows you have a piece of evidence, wouldn't you like to show it to the court? But he phrases his request as a taunt, as if he <em>wants</em> you to present the evidence; this should raise the player's suspicions which is why this example of this trope is more merciful than usual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you present the evidence the first time Damon Gant asks you for it, the fingerprints on the cloth belong to <em>Ema Skye</em>, which gives Lana Skye a reasonable motive both to cover up the supposed Joe Darke murder and to kill Bruce Goodman, who was asked to review evidence of that case. That causes you to instantly lose. The correct response is to hide the cloth, then present it <em>later</em> when you're later capable of proving that while the prints on the cloth belong to Ema, the <em>condition</em> of the cloth proves that Damon Gant was the murderer. Damon Gant will try to call you out on withholding evidence, but you can then point out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">it wasn't relevant until he proved it was</a>, thereby defeating him once and for all.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero">Steins;Gate 0</a></em> involves one of these <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leading to the eventss of this game/timeline. During the events of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueEnding">True Ending</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">first game</a>, Mayuri managed to snap Okabe out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAholdOfYourselfMan">a slap to the face</a> and a pep talk about how he shouldn't give up, which, coupled with a plan from his future self, led to him saving Kurisu, and stopping World War 3 before it even started while he was at it. <em>0</em>, howover, takes place after an alternate version of that event where instead, taking pity on his state at the time, Mayuri encouraged Suzuha to let him recover from his experience before trying to time travel again. Instead, Okabe dove right into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, and by the time he finally snaps out of it, he's missed his window of opportunity to make things right. Thus, in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>...the attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, Mayuri travels to the past to encourage her past self to get Okabe not to give up at that pivotal moment, while Okabe proceeds to become the future version of himself who would give his past self the plan to set everything right.</span>
</li><li> In the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TimeHollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TimeHollow">Time Hollow</a></em>, this happens to Ethan a lot. His first try at fixing each past incident usually makes things worse, and he has to try something else. He has even more trouble in the second half of the game, but this time it's because the bad guy is actively undercutting him.
</li><li> An irritating example occurs at the end of Akiha's route in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akiha has finally succumbed to her demon blood and become a mindless killer. She made you <em>promise</em> to kill her when this happened</span>.

This is her <em>normal</em> end. <em>Keeping</em> your promise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and putting her out of her misery</span> nets you a Bad End despite being much less miserable. (To get the best ending, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, but that's beside the point.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WickedWillow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WickedWillow">Wicked Willow</a></em>, every use of the protagonist's magic can backfire, and numerous seemingly innocent choices (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">healing Avery's liver</span>) have negative consequences for at least some people.

Two other pairs were trapped in the same fashion; both groups were able to figure out the trick in time. When Kanna approaches them asking how they managed it, Mishima lies, claiming that the solution required physical strength — something the petite middle schooler couldn't pull off on her own. Sara and Joe back him up, but this turns out to have been a poor decision later, as Sue Miley gleefully reveals the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> to Kanna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after executing Mishima</span>, hitting her even <em>harder</em>.

<ul><li> This trope is a consistent running theme in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CobraKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CobraKai">Cobra Kai</a></em>, as multiple characters try their best to do the right thing and fail horribly.
<ul><li> Moon is well aware of how the Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do students are one bad day away from killing each other, and does her best to encourage the groups to reconcile. Unfortunately, she does this primarily by inviting both factions to a party without telling either that the other is coming as well. As a result, the night kicks off with both groups feeling ambushed and uneasy.
</li><li> Daniel believes that the aggressive teachings of Cobra Kai require a counter to balance them, and teaches his students the much more passive, peaceful Miyagi-Do school instead. Unfortunately, he emphasizes the martial component of the school more than its philosophy, and constantly alludes to how Cobra Kai is an evil force that requires a counterbalance. As a result, his students wind up contemptuous of their rivals and tend to make only token efforts to avoid combat.
</li><li> During the party in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CobraKaiS2E9Pulpo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CobraKaiS2E9Pulpo">Cobra Kai S2E9 "Pulpo"</a></em>, Hawk briefly tries to adhere to Johnny's teachings about turning the other cheek and showing mercy, an act that does not come easily to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>.

While the Reverend <em>has</em> fought otherworldly invaders and all manner of creatures who did harm, in this case he's actually wrong: Sara/Kellith has actually decided that she's going to do good for the world and promote peace and love. So the Reverend gets the Syndicate (i.e. the organised bad guys) to help him kill her and what would have been a controlled attempt to kill just one person gets hijacked by the Chessmaster, resulting in a large part of the school getting blown up, a number of security personnel and teachers getting maimed and/or killed and all the students being incredibly traumatised.

Turns out that because of that, Chumbucket doesn't have to pay royalties. Carver is seething.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, the main character ultimately agree that the best thing to do regarding their friend Elyon being the Princess of Meridian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">is to not tell her</a>, believing that doing so would cause her unnecessary stress and panic while trying to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. This works...until said villain, who's Elyon's older brother, realizes that they're doing this and decides to tell her everything himself, causing her despise her friends and join his side, making everything worse.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CarmenSandiego">Carmen Sandiego</a> episode "The Stockholm Syndrome Caper", Ivy gets captured at the exact time Carmen crashes in the middle of a forest. With Shadow-san occupied elsewhere, Player has to make the call about who to send Zack after first; since Ivy is less trained and skilled than Carmen and she's actively the prisoner of people who A) think she's Carmen and B) wouldn't hesitate to hurt her either way, Player decides to prioritize her over Carmen. This ends up causing Carmen to nearly freeze to death because while Ivy escaped her captors, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedundantRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedundantRescue">her rescue unnecessary</a>, Carmen was injured in her crash and couldn't make it to shelter before succumbing to the elements.

While seeking out the heroes' Enchiridion, Finn finds a trio of fairies trapped in quicksand. Naturally, he frees them, only to find that they're evil and quickly use everything he does to justify destroying old ladies. Finn nearly has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBsod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBsod">Heroic BSoD</a> until Jake reminds him that A. it was still the right decision to make at the time and B. there's no logical reason for all these old ladies to be here, so they have to be illusions and Finn hasn't actually caused any harm.
