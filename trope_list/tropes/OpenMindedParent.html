Or they genuinely just accept it with frightening ease, telling us they're pretty cool (if weird) people.

<ul><li> Hazumu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl">Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl</a></em> worries about the reaction to his accident, then finds his parents happily chatting with an alien in their kitchen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tenchi's grandfather very quickly accepted a whole flock of strangers moving into his house, although this was related to <em>his</em> secret identity, too. Rather the house belongs to Tenchi's father Nobuyuki, but then he probably likes the idea being surrounded by pretty women. And of course he's really aware of everything.
</li><li> Nobuyuki is also fairly open-minded regarding his son, too. When Nobuyuki sees Ryoko in Tenchi's room, he assumes that Tenchi snuck Ryoko in to sleep with her. Nobuyuki says that, as Tenchi's father, he should respect his son's privacy, and leaves them alone. Not that it stops him from trying to video-tape it from outside "for posterity".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarmaladeBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarmaladeBoy">Marmalade Boy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the anime, Miki and Yuu spend the <em>entire series</em> worrying about their parents' reactions to the two of them dating, only to learn that all four parents knew about it the whole time and thought it was cute.
</li><li> In the manga, things aren't <em>that</em> easy since they really didn't know and Yuu's father Youji even gave him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a> for not asking, but it ends up fine anyway. Yuu thought he was not Youji's son but Jin's (Miki's father, long story) and he felt forced to break up with Miki, as that would make them half-siblings by blood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's really Youji's son. Youji felt vexed for this and angry that Yuu wouldn't just ask them, so he gets angry for the first time in the 8-volume manga.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> To a greater extreme, at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Magical Girl Pretty Sammy</a></em>, it's revealed that not only did her parents know Sasami was Pretty Sammy, but so did her entire school class. They just collectively decided to go along with the whole secret identity thing, because Sasami seemed to want it that way.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>, Aki Hinata encounters Keroro the moment she gets home from work, and not only accepts him into the Hinata home but uses him as inspiration for a new manga character.
</li><li> Kagome's mom, grandpa, and brother are all very accepting of Kagome's time-traveling to fight demons in the feudal era in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>. They seemingly think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">it's better to accept and support Kagome's unavoidable destiny</a> - Mrs. Higurashi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> enough to even buy presents for the rest of the group. They also don't have a problem with Inuyasha and notice early on that she has feelings for him. When her brother asks Inuyasha for romantic advice, he was shocked to learn that they had never told each other they were in love.
</li><li> The parents of the three main protagonists of <em>Kiss×sis</em> take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and are ridiculously understanding about Keita's love life. They are completely fine with both pseudo-incest and student-teacher romance (which even the teacher in question finds disturbing). They also permit (and sometimes even encourage) their children's not-so-innocent games. The only time they oppose their kids' decisions is when Keita talks about marrying both his step-sisters, which they don't do because they are morally opposed to it, but because of the Japanese legal status of polygamy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> Yuri is deeply worried about what will happen when he shows up at home with his entire boy harem, including fiance, from another magical world where he is king. Much to his surprise, his parents already knew he was going to be king, and are merely disappointed that he didn't tell him sooner. His (male) fiance then proudly announces their engagement, despite all Yuri's protests, only for his mother and fiance to plan a shopping trip to buy a wedding gown, much to Yuri's horror.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>
<ul><li> when the time came for Nanoha to explain to her family that she's a mage and how she plans to officially join the Time-Space Administration Bureau, the only one who appeared even remotely shocked upon finding out that magic and different dimensions existed was Nanoha's sister, Miyuki. This might have more to do with the ferret she's been adoring as a pet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">turns out to be a guy</a>. Even before that, during the first season, Nanoha has to join the TSAB for a few days to help out in their investigation, which necessitates missing school and staying onboard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> rather than at her house. What exactly did she tell her parents she was doing during this time? Well, no one's really sure<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0r0g9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0r0g9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0r0g9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">she <em>says</em> she explained the situation, but without mentioning magic... which really doesn't leave very much left to explain</span>, but whatever she told them, it was enough for them to allow their nine-year-old girl to run around with people they've never met for a few days.
</li><li> This can be explained if one is familiar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever">the source material</a>, where her father and older siblings are all ninja bodyguards who take on entire terrorist organizations by themselves. Not letting her run off on a potentially life-threatening mission would be downright hypocritical.
</li><li> This also applies to Nanoha when she becomes a parent herself as she allows her daughter Vivio to pursue any hobby she wants to have (which happens to be magical martial arts) and is fully supportive of her daughter's choice, even providing training sessions for her if she ever asks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em>, Daimon Sayuri was perfectly all right with her son bringing home a small dinosaur Digimon, calling him "Agu-chan" and scolding Masaru for fussing when he took the last of the fried eggs. She comes across as kind, but rather simple-minded, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she reveals that she knew about DATS and Digimon all along, as that was why Masaru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> Suguru... well, disappeared. She had accepted long ago that Masaru would follow in his father's footsteps, and so was utterly unsurprised</span>.
</li><li> Back in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon</a></em>, Izzy's parents take well to Tentomon once they're introduced, and his mother even jumps into linking Cupid to a Digital World prophecy despite not knowing the Digital World existed until recently. The trope is oddly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Izzy himself finds out his parents' long-kept secret that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">adopted</a>, and reveals he'd suspected it already, still loves them and considers them very much his real parents.</span>

</li><li> Takato's parents are quite okay with Guilmon's presence. Mrs. Matsuda is more apprehensive, but not reaching the other extreme.
</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl><ul><li> Mrs. Ketchum has no problem with allowing her son Ash, age 10, to travel the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> world - with or without any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">traveling companions</a> and amass a small personal army of creatures who protect him; it's a custom that borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage">Rite of Passage</a>, after all. Plus, his friends sometimes crash at his place for arbitrary lengths of time as well; again, she's cool with this, and dotes on them almost as though they were her own children. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">the second movie</a>, she's slightly annoyed with him being right in the middle of the end of the world. But she loosens up later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, Gold's mom asks where her son is, but turns around and says "Oh well, he'll be back when he wants to." before getting an answer.
</li><li> When Miyako, Kanon's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari">Umi Monogatari</a></em>, finds out that a mystical talking turtle and two girls from the sea claiming to be her daughter's friends are going to be staying at her house, she's perfectly fine with it.
</li><li> Shinichi's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> don't seem to mind that he's staying as a child so he can be with his girlfriend more. Not exactly in the beginning though, where Yusaku and Yukiko played a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to try force Shinichi/Conan come with them to the USA, so he'd get his condition cured and then testify against the Black Organization. He had to talk with them quite a bit to convince them otherwise.
</li><li> Kyu's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em>. When Kyu is back home one day, she tells him a "cutie" (his childhood friend Kaoru) has come to meet him and wonders if she is Kyu's girlfriend. She then leaves the home to buy groceries to leave Kyu and Kaoru alone. Later, when she sees Kyu and Kaoru holding hands (for an entirely different reason), she apologises for disturbing them. It's later hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mrs. Renjou is actually in a similar, but more down to Earth situation as Sayuri Daimon. She married Satoru Renjou fully knowing that he was a policeman who lived constantly in danger, took it in stride even when Satoru had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe">almost completely disappear from her and little Kyuu's lives to protect them</a>, and ever since his tragic death she's sensed that Kyuu will want to follow in his footsteps.</span> Hence why she offered little resistance when Kyuu said he wanted to go to the DDS, and supported him and his friends as much as she could. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She even lets Ryu live with them for a while.</span>
</li><li> Keima's mother Mari accepts Elsie relatively quickly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows">The World God Only Knows</a></em>. However, she's quite pissed off at her husband as Elsie states that she's an illegitimate child of his.
</li><li> The Fujiwara couple in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends">Natsume's Book of Friends</a></em> are fairly reasonable when their foster son Natsume often shows up disheveled and in situations that he cannot fully explain to them. They are unaware of his spiritual abilities but are supportive and understanding regardless.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series, Nita's parents seem to be awfully accepting of the fact that she's made herself a personal enemy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lone Power</a> by becoming a foot soldier for the Cosmic Forces of Good. But then this might just be resignation in the face of the fact that there's absolutely nothing they can do to stop her: grounding your daughter is pretty futile when she can both walk through walls and teleport.
<ul><li> Apparently, Kit's father took it amazingly well. "My son's a <em>brujo</em>....cool."
</li><li> Don't think that it was easy though. At the time they decided to come out to their parents (during <em>Deep Wizardry</em>), Nita had volunteered to take part in an undersea ritual with the whale wizards without fully understanding that the role she had taken required her to sacrifice herself to complete it. Telling your parents you're probably going to die in the course of your work never goes over well. However both the terms of the ritual and the Wizard's Oath entail that she can't go back on her commitment without serious consequences—at best, the surrender of her wizardry and a boost for the Lone Power, at worst, if the ritual fails, the destruction of the Atlantic seaboard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She makes it out alive because someone was able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>.</span> By the same token, it's dishonorable at best to use wizardry to get out of something like being grounded, and Tom and Carl, the local Seniors, cooperate with parents in on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> and aren't above restricting the powers of a misbehaving wizard if they absolutely have to. (Nita's sister Dariane gets grounded from interplanetary travel in <em>A Wizard's Holiday</em>—worse than it sounds since she has close friends in parts of the universe too far away to observe using conventional astronomy.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheHegemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowOfTheHegemon">Shadow of the Hegemon</a></em>, Peter is flabbergasted when his parents tell him how proud they are of his secret double life as a famous columnist. They then gently chide him for not realizing that his genius is genetic especially given the intellects of his own siblings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing">The Pale King</a></em>: Chris's mother defends her son's actions while dealing with her own issues with regards to feminism and individuality.
</li><li> Peter Grant's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> are very accepting of the fact he's gone from junior copper to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheApprentice">apprentice wizard</a> copper. At one point he reflects that in his Mum's culture being a "witch smeller" is probably <em>more</em> respectable than being a policeman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>: Michael Carpenter, which is even more notable considering that he's also a devout churchgoing Christian. Upon seeing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> daughter return home from running away with all her piercings, tattoos, and multicoloured hair, his first instinct is to hug her. Afterwards, he relays to the protagonist:
<div class="indent"><strong>Michael:</strong> Harry, am I just too old?

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em>. Daniella Ivashkov seems to accept the relationship of her son Adrian with dhampir Rose, though the Moroi in general and her husband Nathan look down on such relationships. She later has a private talk with Rose, revealing that she simply figures their relationship won't last. She is content to let it run its course.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy">Maeve Binchy</a> novel <em>Evening Class</em>, a young woman is explaining to her younger sister that she is actually her mother. She states that <em>her</em> mother's reaction to her out of wedlock teen pregnancy was to say, "Won't it be grand to have another baby around the house." Already remarkable, but even moreso considering that this was Ireland in the 1950s, where such a situation was a <em>major</em> embarrassment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeartsWeSold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeartsWeSold">The Hearts We Sold</a></em>, Gremma's parents are fine with the fact that their daughter is a lesbian. Gremma reveals that briefly after she came out, she saw "how to be supportive of gay kid" in her mom's search history.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrannyKStein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrannyKStein">Franny K. Stein</a></em> book series, Franny's parents do their best to be supportive of their daughter's dabbling in mad science.

He takes Oliver aside and comes out to him, nervous that Oliver will be upset. Oliver indicates to him that both he and his wife Felicity had suspected before William left to live with his mother's parents.

</div></li><li> Richard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a> is one of these towards his daughter Alexis. Amusingly, Alexis is in any case actually far more mature and grounded than her father ever was, and perhaps even <em>over</em>-responsible (on more than one occasion, he actually tries to push her into doing something crazy and irresponsible, believing she's spending the best years of her life wound a little too tight).
<div class="indent"><strong>Castle:</strong> When I was your age I... wait. I can't tell that story. It's wildly inappropriate. Which, oddly enough, is my point. Don't you want wildly inappropriate stories that you can't tell your children?

<ul><li> Joyce Summers tries her absolute hardest to be one after finding out Buffy is The Slayer. She gets there in the end, but it takes her a full season! She attempts to tag along on Buffy's patrols and even brings snacks!
</li><li> Furthermore, Giles' role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> repeatedly has him being the best father any of the cast has ever had, from being fiercely, murderously protective of Buffy to going out of his way to make people happy, even intentionally trying to sacrifice himself to stop Dark Willow, rather than finding a way to kill her. In the comic continuation, he becomes a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> for Faith, too.

Johnny does seem a little uncomfortable when it comes to Alexis's past teenage adventures, but he is non-judgemental in the present. He also tells his pansexual son that he supports all his sexual encounters regardless of gender. Moira gives her daughter advice on seducing men, and she's downright impressed when a hot, towel-clad man comes out of her son's bathroom.

(Note that there are certain things she's somewhat less open-minded about. She kicked Ace out of the house for camping the Quad in a Quake Deathmatch.)
<ul><li> One, renting a room in a huge house is not the same as shacking up with people. Two, Ace's mom is far wilder than Ace is ever going to be: Ace doesn't have a last name because his unmarried mom got knocked up and didn't want to admit who the father was. And if you think that's wild, consider: risk-taker, Air Force sergeant, knows lots of languages, can't talk about what she does when she goes back into the Air Force, self-image is that of a superheroine... <a class="urllink" href="http://tmi-comic.com/2009/01/19/stellarportal/">yep, you guessed it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> Hasuki from <em>Moon Over June</em> was sufficiently annoyed at her parents over her name that she got into lesbian porn for the express purpose of getting back at them. Given that her mother is the sort of person who, during a telephone conversation in the middle of a shoot, reminds her daughter to pace herself so her jaw does not get tired; it is clear that it did not work.

This may have something to do with the Mobius Double Reacharound nature of the timeline(s) there... or, put another way, it's heavily suggested that the guardians know about SBURB and the adventure the kids will be going on, as well as the fact that it's inevitable, so they don't bother trying to stop them.

His boyfriend being a cyborg mad scientist though was a bit hard to swallow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SabrinaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SabrinaOnline">Sabrina Online</a></em>: Sabrina first met RC's parents when they walked in on them sleeping together.

One story, summed up nicely by the page picture, ends with the father revealing he'd bet his son's mother twenty dollars that their son was gay. Another has a daughter telling her father that she's gay and a vegetarian. The father is incredulous... that she's a vegetarian.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Noob">Noob</a></em> franchise has a recurring subject matter of parents of some of the players or other people of older generations having a negative view of gaming. Arthéon's mother, already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">quite meddling</a> in the first place, restricted his playing hours because of that view, which put him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> position to his guildmates and eventually led to his downfall.

After Steven's outburst, Greg starts talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">how happy he is that Steven can talk to him about these things</a>, and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a> would have ended badly for him, which Steven immediately tunes out.
</li><li> Connie Maheswaran's mother, when we first meet her, is very controlling and strict towards her daughter. In the episode "Nightmare Hospital", after Steven and Connie protect her from two gem mutants, she promises to not only be more open to Steven and the Gems' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveFriendInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveFriendInfluence">influence on Connie</a>, but she will be less controlling as well. On Connie's first mission, in the episode "Gem Hunt", Connie's mother has asked Steven to take pictures of Connie, showing her openness and willingness to allow Connie to aid Steven and Pearl.
</li><li> Barb Miller — mother of Sadie Miller — starts off as a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a> but becomes more open to Sadie's wishes to live her own life once Sadie starts calling her out on her controlling behavior. However, we also see a more negative side to this in season 4. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Sadie doesn't come home one night, Barb waits until the next day to look for her, proclaiming that Sadie is old enough to decide whether she sleeps at home or not. This leads to a MAJOR <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> when Steven tells her that Sadie was <em>already headed home</em> when he saw her on the night of her disappearance</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> (and later shown in a comic), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">Avatar Korra's</a> parents, Tonraq and Senna, are fully supportive of their daughter's romantic relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive">Asami Sato</a>—while they're obviously a little surprised upon first learning of it, they're very happy for the two, even going so far as to treat Asami like a second daughter. However, Korra's parents do make a point of warning her and Asami that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">not everyone may be as accepting of the relationship as they are.</a> Avatar Aang is also depicted as such in this series, as he, because of his Air Nomad upbringing, has absolutely no problems with his daughter Kya being lesbian.
</li><li> The dad of the titular protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WillasWildLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WillasWildLife">Willa's Wild Life</a></em> (as well as the book on which it's based, Dan Yaccarino's <em>An Octopus Followed Me Home</em>) seems to be okay with her keeping a zoo full of exotic animals at home, yet it's not clear of how dad is able to afford the upkeep. Willa's so dog-gone sweet that dad indulges her.
