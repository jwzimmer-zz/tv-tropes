You know the universe hates you when getting groped by God is one of your lesser problems.
</li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu">Haré+Guu</a></em> were in a strange place metaphysically already, but then the god-like Guu shows an interest in them and it gets much weirder.

</li><li> Rincewind from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series is knowingly favored of The Lady (that is, of Luck), resulting in an amazing capacity for survival... but also what he calls "preemptive karma;" if it even looks as if something good will happen to him in the future, his karma will ensure that something bad happens immediately, and continues happening so the good things never come around. It doesn't help that being the Lady's favored puts you on the top of Fate's most-hated list. A side-effect of the conflict between Luck and Fate is that even Death himself does not know when Rincewind is going to die. <br/><br/> The only reason that the last statement is true is because of this: Due to the machinations of the Lady, and counter-machinations of Fate, Rincewind has been bounced through time and space so often, the most impressive fact of his life is that he has yet to run into himself. Finding the start, let alone end, of a life like that is damnably hard, even for Death. (Although Rincewind would be (dis)pleased to learn that Death has taken such a personal interest in him that his lifetimer is kept on Death's desk, much as a butterfly collector would keep an interesting specimen. The shape is akin to what you might expect if a drunken glassblower went about making a normal egg-timer, and had a continuous case of hiccups.) <br/><br/>So, when the wizards bring him back and make him comfortable, it scares him more than anything. Because things only stop going wrong when Fate is lining up an even bigger punch. But this seems to have come to an end as of <em>The Last Hero</em> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he accepts the fact he will be on the mission to save the world but clearly states he isn't volunteering. He simply knows by some machination of him hiding he would end up on the ship, or someone would remember his relationship with the people dooming the world and would be forced to join the mission. So he is just cutting out the middle part and getting on board but isn't volunteering for the mission</span>.
<ul><li> While Rincewind is the best-known and the one whose relationship with the deity "playing" him is most often explored, it's evident that other characters in the <em>Discworld</em> novels are also literally being used as cosmic playing pieces.

Worse, because being noble means politics (and politics + time = history), any of your accidents, screw-ups, mishaps and absolutely all of the malicious slander you get associated with will get recorded for posterity. Others will judge you well after you've died, and party games will be played ragdolling your name across witty banter. Usually entirely stripped of context, too. Yay. At least smallfolk generally don't get their horrible, insignificant and political unremarkable lives recorded for others to go all schadenfreude over; except as the occasional named face briefly highlighted as part of a rioting mob, or as a lesson advising against overly swift rises in personal status.

Or worse, if their talents outmatched the gods, or they gave a god an answer they didn't like or gave an award to someone else, they were screwed. And if there was more than one god involved...well, they were screwed either way (just look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">How can it get worse you say?</a> Well, remember the gods could take on any form, including that of any person.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">Oedipus Rex</a></em> makes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. In fact, the gods seem to have randomly picked him out specifically to be their toy: after hearing Apollo's Oracle prophesy that Oedipus would kill him, his father Laius nails his baby son's feet together and leaves him to die on a mountain. Luckily (?) for Oedipus, he's found and brought up in Corinth, where rumours begin to spread that he's a bastard. He goes to the Oracle for proof and hears that he'll kill his father and marry his mother. Not knowing he's adopted, he decides to do the decent thing and run as far as possible in the other direction...whereupon he unwittingly kills Laius and marries the Queen, Jocasta. And just when everything seems to be going well for him, a plague starts up in Thebes. He tries to fix it...by going to the Oracle, who tell him to find Laius's murderer. To cut a long story short, he does. Jocasta hangs herself, Oedipus stabs his own eyes out with the pins from her brooches, then becomes a beggar. And all apparently because the gods were bored. To be fair, the reason usually given for Oedipus' downfall is that by running away after hearing the prophecy, he was "defying the gods" and had to be punished. It's a requirement for tragedies that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a>" deserves it, which often leads to rather extreme punishments for their perceived crimes, such as Oedipus' case.
<ul><li> Actually it was because Oedipus's father captured a prince who then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">killed himself rather then be a slave</a>. (And he wasn't just any old slave to Laius; read "underage gay sex object".) The prince's father then cursed Laius to be killed by his own son. The "marry his mother" part is entirely the result of gods' jerkassness though.
</li><li> Oedipus wasn't the only member of the House of Thebes to be fate's plaything. When the founder of the House Cadmus slew Ares' pet dragon, he was later honored by the gods and married Ares' daughter Harmonia. One of the wedding gifts was a necklace that granted eternal beauty to the wearer but also carried a curse. Said necklace was passed down through the family and brought tragedy to Cadmus' descendants. Nearly every member of the family suffered unfortunate ends. This includes Actaeon, turned into a stag by Artemis and torn apart by his dogs for accidently peeping at her, Semele, mother of Dioynsus who burst into flames from seeing Zeus' true form, Pentheus, who banned the worship of Dioynsus in town but was torn to shreds by his worshippers including his mother and aunts in a fit of madness caused by the worship, Creon (Oedipus' uncle)'s son Haemon, either killed by the Sphinx or killed himself after Antigone killed herself, and Oedipus' four children, his two sons killed each other in battle over rule of the city, the aforementioned Antigone, who defied the law by trying to bury her traitor brother, and was put in jail then committed suicide, and Ismene, either just forgotten about or killed by a warrior.
</li><li> The house of Atreus was pretty bad as well in the The Oresteia. Tantalus killed and cooked his own son, Pelops, to please the gods and might have stolen some of their property. He was sentenced to Tartarus. His son, when put back together, was missing his shoulder blade, so had to be replaced with ivory. Pelops got his wife in a chariot race, with the help of a servant sabotaging the chariot of his master. Pelops didn't fufill his end of the bargin and killed the servant. The servant then laid the curse on the family. Pelop's sister, Niobe, bragged of her 14 children, and all of them were killed by Artemis and Apollo, since she insulted their mother Leto. Niobe was then turned into a rock. Atreus and Thyestes are sons of Pelops. They killed their half-brother in an attempt to get the throne, but were banished for it. Atreus' wife was cheating on him with Thyestes, and they had a struggle for the throne until Atreus found out the infidelity. Atreus killed his nephews and cooked and served them to his brother as revenge. Thysestes then, on advice from the oracle, had sex with his daughter to produce another male heir. The son/grandson Aegisthus was abandoned by his mother and was raised by Atreus. The truth was revealed later, and Aegisthus killed Atreus. Atreus had children before he died, including Agememnon and Menelaus. Menelaus was the husband of Helen of Troy, and her kidnapping by Paris caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>. Agememnon's wife cheated on him with Aegisthus and she killed Agmemnon on his return from war, and their son, Orestes, killed her with help of Elektra, his sister.
</li><li> Classical literature in general seems to be like this. For another example, take <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid">The Aeneid</a></em>: Aeneas, after a giant storm scatters and damages his fleet, pulls into the newly founded city of Carthage. The beautiful queen of Carthage, Dido, rapidly falls in love with him, and everything seems hunky-dory, with his tiny band of Trojans being accepted into civil society. However, the gods send a messenger telling him to go to Italy already, twit. Naturally, he complies, but Dido is driven mad by his abandonment of her and commits suicide, lighting an eternal enmity between Carthage and Rome. This all results from the conflicting schemes of Jupiter, Venus and Juno.
<ul><li> The Aeneid was written between 29 and 19 BC, and is as much a political publication as an entertainment one (Aeneas founding Rome was an attempt to justify the invasion of Greece). Romans were good at these sorts of stories.

Beyond that, the lousy state of the galaxy is often attributed to the sheer number of entities — the Chaos Gods, the C'Tan, Eldar farseers, and the God-Emperor — playing at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">chessmaster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">getting tangled in each others' plots</a>.

The only Space Marine chapter formed during the so-called Cursed Founding to not display obvious mutations or other defects, they nevertheless suffered distrust and prejudice - to the extent that during their debut campaign protecting a world from the forces of Chaos, an allied chapter actually abandoned them, leaving the Lamenters to suffer 80% losses before being rescued by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines">Ultramarines</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteScars">White Scars</a>.

They only re-appeared after fighting the whole way back <em>out</em>, which just made the Imperium distrust them even more. After rebuilding their strength, the Lamenters were redeployed to the other side of the galaxy as part of a brotherhood of chapters guarding another warp storm. Unfortunately one of their allied chapters (and one of the few who actually showed some amount of brotherhood to them) went renegade and dragged the Lamenters onto the wrong side of a civil war, where the Lamenters once again suffered crippling casualties. After the revolt was put down, it was decided that the Lamenters had acted out of misguided honor, and were given the chance to atone through a century-long penitent crusade... right into the oncoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Hive Fleet Kraken</a>.

Their knights fall of their horses unexpectedly, their swords breaks before a killing blow can be delivered, their grand master got dumped on a cart of manure, and their chapter house is swallowed up in a freak earthquake.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> RPG has two Disadvantages that sum up this trope: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Weirdness Magnet</a>," which attracts inconvenient strangeness to the character (the given example includes a talking dog and aliens making a base in the TV set); and "Cursed" which explicitly states "the GM can hose you any time he feels like it, and you have nothing to say about it, because you are Cursed."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em>, each character has a "Fateful Aura" that turns them into walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Weirdness Magnets</a>. Also, the more they use their awesome powers, the more likely they are to tie innocent bystanders into their growing legend. The stronger their Legend, the easier this happens and the more pronounced the effects, which is the main reason the Gods left the mortal world in the first place.
<ul><li> It's somewhat more complex than that. Fate is in essence the human desire for things to operate based on rules of Narrative story. Being Fatebound offers benefits... one binds oneself to a particular role, and becomes more likely to succeed when acting in it... while becoming less likely when trying to defy it. The Gods gathered the power of being Fatebound as Heroes to the Mortals to defeat the Titans... then withdrew from the world to let those mortals die out so that they could be who they wanted instead of who the Mortals expected them to be.

<ul><li> Mario to an extent. It seems that no matter how hard he tries, he never makes the voices stop. His life became a nightmare for him after Peach, his former girlfriend, broke up with him over his baldness. Since then, he has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>, and Bowser and Chef Pee Pee even planned once to have the latter dressed up as a woman to prevent him from killing himself. This has been done up to "Mario's New Girlfriend!", where he hooked up with Rosalina and have lived a better life since. At least until a handicapped child named Jeffy was dropped off at Mario's door, making his life worse than ever. He has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">broken into sobbing</a> several times due to being unable to deal with his situation, to the attempt where he actually killed himself once over Jeffy. Clearly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> for him.
</li><li> Chef Pee Pee gets constantly tortured by Bowser and his son Bowser Junior, especially the latter. However, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the <em>Chef Pee Pee Quits</em> series.

Johnny has had his house broken into multiple times and has been abused and humiliated by virtually every other character in the series, including <em>the grim reaper</em>. He's also unable to do anything about it as, in one of the most literal examples of the 'plaything' aspect of this trope, he's just a character in a heavily modded copy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4">The Sims 4</a>, and Joel is the one playing the game, so Johnny can do nothing to stop the train of abuse that comes his way constantly.

He was abandoned by his parents and never got proper school education as a result, having to work at a delivery service just to make a living. He has also been caught in a silo explosion which was followed by a long painful recovery, went through a possible divorce, and lost a job opportunity at the power plant to a dog which led to his run in with Homer and he quickly becomes baffled that Homer has everything a deserving and hardworking man should have despite not deserving it due to his idiotic slothful nature. Frank's obsession with trying to prove how this isn't how life should work <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends with him going crazy and electrocuting himself to death. Even his funeral was as a joke due to Homer's sleeping interrupting the service.</span> Yeah, the people behind that episode REALLY didn't like Frank Grimes.

Cartman had been anal probed for starters, Kenny has been killed many times, and Stan and Kyle would sometimes get ridiculously short ends of the stick, especially Kyle for some reason.
<ul><li> Episodes like "Cartmanland" and "HUMANCENTiPAD" seem to imply that Cartman is God's plaything, receiving what he loves and then having it taken away just to mess with him. <em>Definitely</em> a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma">Call It Karma</a>, though—"Cartmanland" largely focused on the idea that a universe where Cartman actually got what he wanted would not be just.

Granted, the prerequsit to have Fairy Godparents in the first place is to be miserable but even then he is tormented constantly. The writers even go so far as subverting the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">trope</a> by letting the character of Jorgen Von Strangle tell Timmy that his very existence causes misery for everyone. He is also frequently tormented by Francis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a>, Vicky his evil babysitter, and Mr. Crocker his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>. And that's not including his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">neglectful parents.</a> Even when Timmy wishes for his situation to improve, he is forced to wish everything back to normal (more often than not because said wishes proceed to make things worse!), a very notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, thus continuing his ongoing misery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>'s sister Candace. Her relentless quest to "bust" her brothers and prove their outlandish activities to their parents means she gets dragged through the wringer and usually gets within a whisker of succeeding, only to have it all snatched away at the last moment thanks to Dr. Doofenshmirtz's inventions backfiring, leaving her looking crazy. Though like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Wile E. Coyote</a>, Candace often brings it upon herself by refusing to give up her obsession, but it does seem that fate is against her: even if <em>the entire universe</em> has to expand to rob her of validation, it'll happen.
<ul><li> Even worse, a number of later episodes have Candace attempting to rid herself of her obsession, which inevitably fail just as badly as her attempts to "bust" Phineas and Ferb. Basically, not only is she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">not allowed to succeed</a>, she's not allowed to <em>stop trying</em>.

</li><li> Squidward from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>. It seems that the whole universe is out to make him miserable, whether it be his dreams being shattered like glass (no doubt by SpongeBob and Patrick, or just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">yanked away by anything</a>), or just being hurt for no reason. It's little wonder that fans of the show have declared him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>.
<ul><li> Plankton. If, even for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. It seems that even the most wretched attempts of wanting to steal the Krabby Patty formula, the karma will come back at him with a worse punishment.

The short "Bedside Matters" just shows, having him simultaneously run a fever and have <em>every bone in his body broken</em>, all while being "taken care of" by his nurse, Rodney.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">Gumball Watterson</a> in the episode "The Curse" where he finds himself under a plague of bad luck for no explained reason.
<ul><li> Gumball Watterson in the entire series, honestly. Half the time he does bring it on himself due to his crazy schemes but other times it seems like the universe just wants to mess with him for no good reason. Case in point, in the episode "The Vegging" when he just wants to not go on any adventures and spend a day doing nothing, the universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">goes out of it's way</a> to make sure that doesn't happen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">He was once going to be a black cat to reflect how unlucky he is.</a>
<div class="indent"> <strong>Gumball:</strong> I swear, sometimes it's like the whole universe is against me.

While karma does play a lot into their bad luck, the contrived nature of their endless pain and misfortune almost comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckAmuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckAmuck">some higher being out there having sadistic fun...</a>
<ul><li> Wile E. Coyote is a stand out example. While a key rule in his character is that he could stop his pursuits (and thus his abuse) at any time, his schemes to get a basic meal always fail in often the most contrived (and painful) of ways. Even when he anticipates an error in his plan, fate is always a step ahead of him and twists things back in his direction.
</li></ul></li><li> Frizz and Nug of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> bemoan this status endlessly.

In one episode they try to get to the candy store because there's a sale on jawbreakers, but the universe throws everything at them from a severe thunderstorm to a <em>stampede of chickens</em>. At that point, Edd gave us this quote:
