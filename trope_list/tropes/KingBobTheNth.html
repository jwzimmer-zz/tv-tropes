Arguably subverted when General Varana of House Anadile was adopted as the son of Ran Borune XXIII and took the throne as Ran Borune XXIV instead of Ran Anadile I.
<ul><li> They also seem to think that Polgara and Belgarath are hereditary names, and so the current one has an ordinal up in the hundreds—because the Tolnedrans can't wrap their minds around the fact that it's been the same two people all along.

<ul><li> The Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men in Westeros do this, sometimes more formally as "the Nth of his name." Since the books are set at the beginning of a new dynasty that comes from a different naming culture than the founding dynasty (Robert Baratheon was the first king of the Seven Kingdoms to be actually named Bob, not Jaerhaehaerysgargon), most of the kings we actually see are only the first of their name, but the previous Targaryen dynasty had racked up five Aegons, two Viseryses, two Jaeheryses, and two Aeryses, with a smattering of other names that never got recycled.
</li><li> Balon Greyjoy, whose dynasty dates back to ancient times (though they only rose to power following the Targaryen Conquest), is apparently the ninth of his name. There were also at least five King Theon Greyjoys at one point or another.
</li><li> While the exact number isn't known, the Starks have had a tradition of naming one son Brandon in every generation... going back 8,000 years to Brandon the Builder. Even if only one generation in five had a Bran in charge, and if the average reign was 20 years, that would make the current Bran Stark (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is, in theory, the King in the North after Robb died at the Red Wedding</span>) the 80th of his name.
</li><li> There's also brief mention of two kings of the Reach: Garth XII and Mern IX of House Gardener. The latter was the final king of the Reach, at the time of Aegon's Conquest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldOfIceAndFire">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a></em>, House Durrandon's time as kings of the Stormlands had a tradition of naming the firstborn son of each king after the line's founder, Durran Godsgrief. The maesters producing the in-universe documents that make up <em>The World of Ice and Fire</em> find this particularly irritating, because the fragmentary nature of the records mean that they know <em>a</em> King Durran did this or that thing, but they're not sure <em>which one</em>, leading to annotations that they <em>think</em> the King Durran who did thus-and-so was the tenth of his name - not counting the original Durran Godsgrief, whose thousand-year reign they think might have been a collection of Durrans rolled into one by the process of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth">myth-making</a>. Basically, Stormlands history is very confusing up to Aegon's Conquest and the founding of House Baratheon.
</li><li> Ironically, Robert Baratheon is the first of his name, and so is, as far as we know, Robb Stark.
</li></ul></li><li> In Suzette Haden Elgin 's Ozark cycle, the men of Ozark like to recycle names (as opposed to the women, who must be Properly Named by the Grannies from numerological principles), using numbers to distinguish. Complicated because the names are used just because someone likes the sound of them, and the numbers do not indicate direct descent, but just the number of times that name has been used... "John Jacob Traveler the Hundredth" means only that there were 99 John Jacob Travelers before him.
</li><li> In John Boyd 's Last Starship From Earth, numbers indicate descent in a professional "dynasty". However, priests, in a one-upsmanship contest between Irish and Jewish factions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>) bend this by simply counting the number of alleged priests in their families. The ludicrous Father Kelly XL "apparently decided to count his ancestors who were Druid priests."
</li><li> The not-exactly-hereditary nobles of Wright's <em>Islandia</em> count the number of their family to hold a particular position — within certain limits. In his lost "cultural" notes on Islandia, Wright explained the system, noting that it was "sometimes confusing to foreigners" — to which his daughter Sylvia added "I am a foreigner."

Since the series spans four centuries, certain names get reused; Marsellus I and III are major characters in two different books, and princes named Marsellus feature in two more. Kassandras, Atreuses and Kathrines also appear frequently.
</li><li> Emperors of Arkon in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a></em> universe use this in conjunction with their family name.

The numbers don't get particularly high, at least on the family trees included in the appendices; only the Durins, which get to Durin VII and Last, get beyond III. Aragorn was Aragorn II as Chieftain of the North, but took a new name, Elessar, as king. None of the rulers of Gondor or Arnor were numbered beyond II.
<ul><li> The Elves, in contrast, never reused names; there are several likely reasons for this, the most obvious being that they're immortal so it would be awkward. Yet seven of the Ruling Stewards of Gondor were named for Elves of the First Age (Denethor twice, Orodreth, Ecthelion twice, Egalmoth, Turgon); one may wonder what the Elves thought of that.

<ul><li> Regnal numbering only began in 12th or 13th century Europe; numbers prior to this have been applied in retrospect by historians. Before this, monarchs were distinguished by nicknames (e.g. the English kings Edmund the Magnificent and Edmund Ironside) or by paternity.
<ul><li> This is why Edward Longshanks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfPlantagenet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfPlantagenet">The House of Plantagenet</a> (r. 1272-1307) is called Edward I even though three previous Edwards (Edward the Elder, Edward the Martyr, and Edward the Confessor) had been King of England (well, King of the English...) before the Norman Conquest of 1066.
</li><li> James I and James II are properly "James I and VI" and "James II and VII" (of England and Scotland respectively), double dipping this trope. Most of the other monarchs of the UK, both before and after the act of Union, haven't recycled names from before the Scottish and English thrones merged. Current protocol is that the higher number takes precedence, hence Edward VII, Edward VIII and Elizabeth II. In the cases of Mary II, William III and William IV, the numbers happen to match: England and Scotland had each had one Mary and two Williams before the crown union. Neither had an earlier Charles or George or Victoria, so that wasn't an issue. Conveniently, since 1707, no monarch has had a name with a higher Scottish numbering than English, and the royals are unlikely to do so; thus we are unlikely to see David III, James VIII, or Robert IV on the throne any time soon.
<ul><li> In the 1950s, Scottish extremists began a campaign of blowing up mailboxes with the "EIIR" cypher (characteristically punishing the SENDERS) to highlight that Scotland never had an "Elizabeth I", so could not have an "Elizabeth II".
</li></ul></li><li> There was some talk about the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge being named Alexander, in which case he would have had to be "Alexander IV", but in the end he was named George (full name George Alexander Louis).
</li><li> The British monarchy is also relatively tame on this trope and none of the numbers have gotten into the double digits yet. Eight Henries and Edwards, seven Jameses, and six Georges. There's also four Williams in England plus one in Scotland, which also had four Malcolms.
</li><li> Averted with, among others, King Stephen, King John and Queen Anne. No numbers since they're the only monarchs to bear that name on the English/British throne. Anne doesn't stand out since there haven't been that many reigning queens but Stephen hasn't been recycled since 1154. (Not all that surprising, since King Stephen reigned during a disastrous civil war and also was the first and only member of the House of Blois to sit on the English throne, without becoming part of the ancestry of his successors. Queen Anne, on the other hand, was quite a successful monarch, so the current queen had no problem using that name for her daughter.) Contrary to a popular misconception, the name John has been reused in the English and British royal family — for instance, his grandson Edward I's prematurely-deceased eldest son was named John, the current royals are all descended from John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, and the youngest son of George V was Prince John (190519).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> has also not been recycled, but considering that she was relatively recent and that there has only been one queen regnant since her, this may not mean anything. It may be permanently unused to preserve the uniqueness, but then people thought the same thing about Elizabeth until 1952 (when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">the present monarch</a> first learned of her accession, her personal secretary asked her, "By what name shall you be known?" expecting her to pick a different regnal name<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note40qkc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note40qkc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note40qkc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most likely her second middle name Mary, becoming Mary III</span>; the ever-practical Queen surprised him and said, "My own, of course.")
<ul><li> Victoria, apparently a bit full of herself, hoped that all her successors would be named Albert or Victoria (or Victor). Her son Prince Albert Edward ditched that idea to become King Edward VII. His eldest son was named Albert Victor, but predeceased his father and grandmother without issue. His grandson Albert thought the name a bit too Germanic for a British king, and became King George VI (though he had a younger brother named George), as a symbol of continuity with his father King George V, which was meant to try to bring stability back to the country after the Abdication Crisis.
</li></ul></li><li> Charles Philip Arthur George, the present Prince of Wales, once said he intended to be "King George VII", not "Charles III", as the two previous Kings named Charles had been rather unlucky. This means that his grandson will in all likelihood be George VIII (assuming he doesn't want to mess with people by becoming Louis I or worse, Alexander IV).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zfve');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5zfve" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zfve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There having been three Kings Alexander of Scotland, the Scots would likely be very angry about him calling himself "Alexander I," and whether or not Scotland ever actually goes for independence, it's unlikely to ditch the monarchy, so Scottish opinion will matter a lot.</span> Charles' first son William on the other hand will presumably be become "William V".
</li><li> In the (now highly unlikely) event that Prince Harry became king, he would likely be Henry IX. (Although the last Henry was somewhat unsavoury, the alternatives are worse; his full name is "Henry Charles Albert David," considering that "Charles" is probably more of a no-no than "Henry"—see the bit about his dad—"Albert" is permanently reserved for Queen Victoria's Prince Consort, and "David" would not only require everyone to be confused about "David III" but would also remind his uncles about the other David—their late and unpleasant great-uncle Edward VIII, known to his family by that name.)
</li></ul></li><li> Pope John XXIII (actually the 21st Pope of this name, due to some confusion in numbering; Antipopes make everything terrible — the 20th century John XXIII is also the second John XXIII), plus John Paul II. And to complete the dual names, there was Paul VI. Also Benedict XVI, Gregory XVI, Pius XII, Leo XIII, Clement XIV, Innocent XIII, Stephen IX (once called Stephen X, due to one dying before officially becoming Pope), Boniface IX, Urban VIII, Alexander VIII, Adrian VI, Celestine V, Nicholas V, Sixtus V, Martin V (technically there were only three of the name, but a mistranslation of two Popes named Marinus led to the confusion), Anastasius IV, Eugene IV, Honorius IV, Sergius IV, and Felix IV, plus an Antipope Felix V. Before our current Pope Francis, the last Pope to have an original name was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Lando</a> (no, honestly!), reigned AD 91314 (unless one counts "John Paul" as original).
<ul><li> Interestingly, the first John Paul <em>actually called himself</em> "John Paul I" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0kcgf');"><sup>Latin </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0kcgf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0kcgf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ioannes Paulus <strong>Primus</strong></span>, which means Francis is unquestionably the first since Lando not to have an ordinal.
</li><li> Also, there's confusion in the numbering of several papal names, including numbers that were mistakenly skipped over. This is a plot point in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBranchCabell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBranchCabell">James Branch Cabell</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurgenAComedyOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurgenAComedyOfJustice">Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, the French had approximately 18 kings named Louis. And one Louis-Phillippe. Oh, and ten named Charles and six named Philip and four named Henry. The current heir to the house of Bourbon styles himself as Louis XX (Louis XIX having been the nominal last king of France for 20 minutes in 1830).
<ul><li> Deliberately invoked from the 17th Century through to the French Revolution: every heir in direct line for the throne was given the first name Louis, for <strong>eight generations</strong> beginning with Louis XIII.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xavh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6xavh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xavh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">XV was XIV's great-grandson; XVI and XVIII were XV's grandsons; XVII was XVI's son, never crowned. In each case, the intervening generations were also all named Louis.</span> In fact, Louis XVI and Louis XVIII were brothers, both named Louis but with different middle names. The first Bourbon king (Henry IV, who succeeded in 1589) was ten generations from his last royal ancestor, Louis IX (who died in 1270), and it was perhaps to reinforce their claim to the throne that the Bourbons named most of their sons Louis, although the fact that Louis IX was the only Capetian king to be canonised as a saint may have been even more important.
</li><li> There were also four Frankish kings named Clovis, which was an early form of the name that became Louis, so the real number could arguably be 22.
</li></ul></li><li> The numbering of the kings and emperors of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a> not surprisingly is a bit chaotic, even though the ordinal numbers go up as high as 7 (Henry (Heinrich) VII and Charles (Karl) VII); whether a king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor or not did not affect the ordinal number. However, as at various points you had a ruler appointing his eldest son co-ruler and having him crowned during his lifetime in a bid to turn the elective monarchy into a hereditary one or two rulers vying for the title, often when either the great feudal lords or the pope set up an "anti-emperor". Co-rulers who predeceased their fathers and anti-emperors usually did have a number assigned to them, but that rule was not strictly enforced. In one case they may also have forgotten that there already was a king or emperor of the same name and number, thus the list includes two rulers called Louis (Ludwig) IV, to wit Louis the Child (r. 900-911) and Louis the Bavarian (1314-1347). There are also rulers listed as Henry (VI.) (crowned in 1147 as co-ruler of Conrad III, but predeceased him) and one called Henry (VII.) (he was the son of Frederick II, crowned as co-emperor in 1222, but deposed by his father after he rebelled against him) as well as Henry VI (1169-1197) and Henry VII (1308-1313). Another complication occurred when Frederick of Habsburg came to the throne: when he was made king in 1440, he was assigned the number IV, counting his Habsburg predecessor Frederick the Fair (anti-king to Louis IV the Bavarian 1314-1330) as legitimate, but when he was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1452 he was renumbered Frederick III. There was also an Otto IV. There was also a co-ruler named Ferdinand IV.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NotableSwedishMonarchs">Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is probably only the 10th king named Carl/Charles/Carolus; when Swedish kings first adopted regnal numbers in the 16th century, they based them on a history that was pretty much entirely fabricated for events before the 11th century, and this history listed a number of Carls who likely never existed. It also lists a few rulers who <em>did</em> exist, but whose described connection to Sweden is questionable — for instance, in the unlikely event that an Attila rises to the throne of Sweden, he would be Attila <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AttilaTheHun">II</a> according to that history. (That's a common name in Iceland, spelt <em>Atli</em>.)
<ul><li> Another Swedish example is Erik XIV, who was probably something like the seventh or eighth Erik to rule Sweden. Like some English examples of less successful monarchs, he is and will probably remain the <em>last</em> king of that name.
</li><li> More recently, there were six kings named Gustaf. Earlier, there was Magnus IV.
</li></ul></li><li> Heinrich LXXII, Prince of Reuss-Lobenstein-Ebersdorf. But unlike with most European monarchies, his number does not indicate that he was preceded by 71 previous rulers also named Heinrich. By tradition, all male members of the House of Reuss are named Heinrich, and are numbered by order of birth within the family in general. In the Reuss Younger Line, the numbering system was reset at the beginning of each century; thus Heinrich LXXII's high number is directly related to his having been born at the very end of the 18th century (1797).
<ul><li> This is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Enforced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Enforced">enforced</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exaggerated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exaggerated">exaggerated</a> example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedAfterSomebodyFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedAfterSomebodyFamous">Naming After Somebody Famous</a>; the House of Reuss <em>requires</em> all male descendents to be named Heinrich after Henry (Heinrich) VI, Holy Roman Emperor, since the 12th century. In the Elder Line the numbers increase and are reset at the start of each century. That's why the current head of the House is Heinrich XIV (son of Heinrich IV), though the last actual ruler of Reuss (Elder Line) was Heinrich XXVII, who was the grandson of Heinrich LXVII. Confusing, no?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> was ruled by <em>thirty-three</em> separate dynasties over the course of <em>3,000</em> years.
<ul><li> The epithet that would ultimately hold the record for most used would be "Ptolemy", which was held by almost every ruling member of the Ptolemaic Dynasty, with a grand total of fifteen rulers holding the name. In second place was "Ramesses", which would have eleven.
</li><li> It bares noting, however, that the names most people now know them for were not the names that would have appeared in Egyptian records. Rather, upon assuming the throne, the pharaoh would assume a "throne name", which would be how they would be referred to by the Egyptians; since the pharaohs would often choose these names very deliberately to suit their agendas and legitimize their rule, there were rarely, if ever, any repeats. Unfortunately, those names are generally rather complicated and hard to pronounce (often having extensive meanings behind them), so most Egyptologists refer to them with their given names.
</li><li> The Cleopatra who wooed Caesar and Marc Antony was actually Cleopatra VII.
<ul><li> But not the seventh ruling Cleopatra.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The kings of Thailand, who have traditionally adopted the regnal name "Rama" since the late 18th century. The current monarch, Vajiralongkorn, has the regnal name Rama X. It's variable whether a king of Thailand will actually treat "Rama" as a regnal name or merely a title. In the current Chakri dynasty, only Vajiravudh (Rama VI) has actually called himself Rama. But it's considered an appropriate way for other people to refer to any kind as "Rama (number)", because Thai tradition is that the king's name is sacred and should not normally be spoken.
<ul><li> The kings of earlier Thai/Siamese dynasties included four kings named "Ramathibodi" (Overlord Rama), four named "Borommarachathirat" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">or "Borommaracha Thirat" or "Boromma Rachathirat"</a>), nine named "Sanphet", and four named "Borommaracha", all of which are numbered. Though many were ultimately better known by their birth names.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KnightFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KnightFever">British peerage</a>, a hereditary peer of the realm gets a number with his <em>title</em> rather than with his <em>name</em>: thus "The Nth Duke of Somewhere". If a title lapses and is later created again, the numbering starts over again. E.g., Andrew Russell is the 15th Duke of Bedford, of the Fifth Creation (1694) of that title; the First Creation was in 1414; and before that, there were two creations of Earls of Bedford, one of which remains as a subsidiary title of the Duke of Bedford, so the Duke of Bedford is also the (N+4)th Earl of Bedford, as the Dukedom was created for the 5th Earl. (This isn't entirely academic; if the male heirs of the first Duke ever die out, the heir of a younger son of the fourth Earl will become Earl <em>but not Duke</em> of Bedford.) The Duke is also the 15th Marquess of Tavistock (the title was given to the 5th Earl at the same time as his dukedom); however, the person usually who <em>uses</em> the title and is thus <em>called</em> Lord Tavistock is the Duke's (eldest and thus far only) son Henry, as a courtesy title—but although Lord Tavistock <em>uses</em> that title, he is not actually the 15th Marquess of Tavistock (which is his father) or the 16th (which he will only become when his father dies). Now, although Andrew Russell is (among other titles) an earl, he is not the Earl Russell: that's his distant cousin John Francis Russell, 7th Earl Russell, heir of a title created for the junior line descending from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EarlRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EarlRussell">John Russell</a>, third son of the 6th Duke. On yet another hand, the Duke is also the 19th <em>Baron</em> Russell, a title awarded to his ancestor in 1539 for services to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor">The House of Tudor</a>...which is not to be confused with the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Baron Russell</a> <em>of Liverpool</em>, which belongs to the descendants of an unrelated Victorian and Edwardian-era journalist and Liberal politician (the 2nd Baron Russell of Liverpool and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertrandRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertrandRussell">3rd Earl Russell</a> sent a joint letter to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">Times</a></em> in 1951 clarifying that "that neither of us is the other"). And now you know why it's critically important to include both the number and the full title when referring to British peers on first reference.
</li><li> In the Eastern Ijaw Kingdoms of Nigeria (Okrika, Opobo, Bonny, Kalabari, Nembe), kingship is the property of a particular War Canoe House (a trading company), and with its Chief becoming the Monarch. Each monarch officially reigns under the House name, adopting the regnal number following his predecessor. Most of them are in the double digits now.
<ul><li> For instance, the King of Kalabari is the tenth from the Amakiri House/Dynasty, and has the given name Abiye Suku, so he reigns as King Abiye Suku, Amakiri X.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with the actor David H. Lawrence XVII. He is not the seventeenth David H. Lawrence in his family... he is the seventeenth David H. Lawrence to be registered on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a>, who plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Eleventh Doctor</a>, managed to get the title of Matt Smith XI on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> as well.
</li><li> A similar numbering was also used in some armies to distinguish officers of the same name within one unit (or, ca. 1800, officers of the rank of colonel and above within the entire Russian army), or even privates within a regiment.
</li></ul></li><li> The House of Savoy, formerly reigning over Italy, tried to do this with the names Vittorio Emanuele and Umberto, their last four kings being, in order, Vittorio Emanuele II (originally King of Sardinia, his minister Cavour managed to expand the state enough to claim kingship over Italy), Umberto I, Vittorio Emanuele III and Umberto II, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">heir and only male child</a> being named Vittorio Emanuele. The situation is made more complex by the existence of three previous Umberto with the title of <em>Count</em> of Savoy, including the founder Umberto I the White-Handed. Other popular names were Amedeo (they got to Amedeo IX between counts and dukes, plus its presence as the second part of the regnal names of a duke, a duke-turned-king and a king) and regnal names containing Carlo and Vittorio as the first name and Emanuele as second.
<ul><li> It is an Italian tradition to name first and second son after paternal and maternal grandfathers.
</li></ul></li><li> The current Queen of Denmark may only be the second Margrethe, but her predecessors embodies this trope to its fullest: She is the first monarch in more than 450 years who isn't named either <em>Frederick</em> or <em>Christian</em>, with her father being Frederick IX and her grandfather being Christian X, and probably only because both were considered somewhat unsuitable names for a woman. She overlooked the fact that "Margrethe I" was not actually Queen "of" Denmark (she founded the Kalmar Union, a union of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden). This caused a bit of trouble when naming her heir apparent, her first son, since she wanted to keep going with the custom; they eventually decided that since her father was a Frederick, she would be counted as a Christian, and thus he was named Frederick. As Crown Prince Frederick has named his son Christian, it appears the tradition will resume with Frederick X followed by Christian XI.
<ul><li> It is worth noting, however, that Margrethe wasn't the heir to the throne when she was born<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7a4dh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7a4dh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7a4dh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> That honour went to her uncle, Hereditary Prince Knud, who would have broken the tradition if he had chosen to go with his first name</span>, as the line of succesion at the time was still very much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a>. And Margrethe naming her son Frederik also solved a long-running issue of the Christians and Frederiks being out of sync <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8wjn8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8wjn8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8wjn8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Before her, the line went Christian IX, Frederik VIII, Christian X, Frederik IX</span>. Curiously, the one time a King tried to break the synchronized line<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note94a55');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note94a55" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note94a55');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Christian IV who named his heir Christian</span>, the heir died before him, and the second in line became king as Frederik III.
</li><li> Earlier in Denmark's history, there were Eric VII, Canute VI, and Valdemar IV.
</li></ul></li><li> The Arab monarchies traditionally avert this—although names repeat, the tradition was to identify rulers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmXSonOfY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmXSonOfY">Fulan bin Allan</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ufj8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10ufj8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ufj8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Fulan" and "Allan" are Arabic equivalents of "John Doe" and "Richard Roe", and "bin" means "son of"</span>, there are two modern monarchies which are easing into this:
<ul><li> Jordan is currently on Abdullah II, son of Hussein, who has named his son and heir Hussein, making "Hussein II" likely...and it's likely that Hassan II will name his son and heir (when he has one) "Abdullah."
</li><li> Morocco is already here; the current king is Muhammad VI, and has named his son Hassan after his father Hassan II.
</li><li> Note that it's an Arab tradition to name your eldest son after your father. Assuming Jordan and Morocco remain monarchies (and the eldest sons consistently live long enough to inherit the thrones), we can look forward to some very high-numbered Husseins alternating with Abdullahs in Jordan and Hassans alternating with Muhammads in Morocco in the future... (A bit like Denmark, actually...)
</li><li> The last Muslim king of Granada, while commonly called Boabdil, had the regnal name Muhammad XII. He vied for the throne with his uncle El Zagal, also known as Muhammad XIII. It is possible that there was a failure in record keeping and that they should be called Muhammad XI and Muhammad XII instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In Tsarist Russia, the most often used name for the Tsars was, unsurprisingly, Ivan. There were six of them, alternating with Vasilies and Feodors. But after the final two Ivans turned out to be ill-fated (Ivan V was a weak-minded co-regent to the more famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a>, and Ivan VI was deposed as a baby, grew up in prison, then was killed), the Romanovs ceased to use this name (the name Feodor turned out to be even less lucky, with neither of the three Feodors turning out to be any good). Soon after they started to alternate Alexanders and Nicholases, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Revolution</a> happened before they managed to accumulate a lot of these.
<ul><li> Before Paul I, the standard naming tradition to identify monarchs without an ordinal was by name and patronymic, similar to the Arabic custom above (Anna Ioannovna<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11l0o7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11l0o7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11l0o7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Anna, daughter of Ioann (Ivan)</span>, Alexei Mikhailovich<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12wedn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12wedn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12wedn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Alexei, son of Mikhail</span> etc). Before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a>, this was used for all tsars at all, the ordinals weren't used and were assigned postfactum by historians.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with King Willem Alexander from the Netherlands, who would be Willem V (William the Fifth), but in an interview prior to his inauguration, he said:
<div class="indent"> I mean, I'm not a number. You know, Willem Five is next to Bertha 21 in the meadow. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note139mk5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note139mk5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note139mk5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Referring to cow names (The first female calf of a cow named Bertha would be named 'Bertha 2' and so on) </span>
</div></li><li> Examples from Spain include Alfonso XIII, Ferdinand VII, Charles IV, and the current monarch Felipe VI. Prior to Spanish unification, there were Henry IV of Castile, Sancho IV of Castile, and Peter IV of Aragon.
</li><li> The Byzantine Emperors had Constantine XI, Michael IX, John VIII, Leo VI, Andronikos V, Alexios V, and Romanos IV.
</li><li> In Bulgaria, the only ordinals universally agreed upon are those of Boris III, Simeon II, Coloman II and Georgi/George II. The rest are inconsistent:
<ul><li> With Tzars named Ioan/Ivan, historians argue whether every instance of the name counts (resulting in Ioan XII), or Tzars also bearing the Asen dynastic name should be numbered separately (Ioan Asen V). Ioans from the last ruling dynasty are better known by their second names, possibly similar to how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">related house of Basarab of Wallachia</a> used the name Ιoan/Ion as a title before every ruler's actual name, relying on its original Hebrew meaning of "[by] God's will".
</li><li> Those named Peter number up to II or IV, depending whether royal descendants who unsuccessfully rebelled against Byzantine occupation count.
</li><li> Theodore was the name borne by Peter II/IV before he renamed himself for the sake of continuity, so some consider the later Theodore Svetoslav as Theodore II.
</li><li> The numeral of Tzars named Mikhail/Michael is also disputed because it's not clear if Boris I also counts as Mikhail I after his baptism and renaming.
</li><li> Constantine II was the son of the last independent Tzar before the country fell to the Ottomans, but it's still disputed whether he claimed the title when he rebelled against his sovereigns.
</li></ul></li><li> Western Roman Emperors are often referred to by nicknames or variants of their surnames, for instance the three Gaius Julius Caesars in the Julio-Claudian dynasty are typically known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>.
</li><li> In Norway, the current king is Harald V<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14jmxg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14jmxg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14jmxg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> There have been six kings of Norway named Harald, but Harald Bluetooth is not included in the numbering system for monarchs. </span>, with his two immediate predecessors being Olav V and Haakon VII<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15trbe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15trbe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15trbe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Haakon could have chosen to go by his given name and been King Charles V (or Christian I, though given that his brother was King Christian X of Denmark that would've probably been too confusing), but being an elected monarch he chose to endear himself to his people (though several of his ancestors had been kings of Norway, he was himself Danish) and use the Old Norse name Haakon</span>. Harald will be succeeded by his son Haakon VIII, which will make Haakon the most common name for Norwegian monarchs when he ascends. Going back farther, we have Magnus VII.
</li><li> The Ottoman Empire had Mehmed VI, Murad V, and Mustafa IV.
</li><li> In Tonga, the current king is Tupou VI. He is only the sixth monarch of the country, as each monarch included the name Tupou, the name of their royal house, in their regnal name along with their personal name, though even that still qualifies as three of the previous monarchs were named George.
</li><li> Bavaria was particularly fond of having rulers named Ludwig. Not only did they have three kings named Ludwig, when they were a duchy, they had 10 dukes named Ludwig, for a total of 13 rulers named Ludwig. They also had 16 dukes named Henry, five named William, five named Albert, and seven named Otto, which, combined with a later King Otto, left them with eight rulers named Otto. When Bavaria was an Electorate, there were four electors named Maximilian, the last of which became the first king. Combined with the later King Maximillian II, there were five rulers named Maximilian.
</li><li> From the German House of Mecklenburg, the last ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was Adolphus Frederick VI, while the last ruler of neighboring Mecklenburg-Schwerin was Frederick Francis IV. Earlier monarchs from the House include Johann VII, Albrecht VII, Henry V, and Nicholas V of Werle.
</li><li> A twist in the United States: the former Presidents Bush are often called "Bush 41" and "Bush 43", referring to their positions in the overall line of Presidents rather than direct succession of the name. More poetic writers might stick closer to this trope and call them Bush the Elder and Bush II. Formally, though, similarly-named Presidents are distinguished by their middle names or initials, e.g. John Adams/John Quincy Adams; George H. W. Bush/George W. Bush.
<ul><li> There have only been four sets of Presidents that were knowingly related (One geneologist worked out that every president up to Obama is a cousin to some degree of all the others if you trace their lineage back to the 12th Century), the aforementioned Adams and Bushes were both father/son presidents. The two Roosevelt (Theodore and Franklin) are distinguished by nicknames (Teddy and FDR, Respectively). William and Benjamin Harrison (grandfather/grandson) tend not to have much trouble with distinguishing between them, possibly because William died in office after a month without ever having the opportunity to actually do anything. Another trend is to refer to the President by the order in which they ascended (current President Donald Trump is occasionally referred to simply as "45". Roman Numerals are almost never used by Americans when discussing the President, with the earliest known precedence of ignoring this rule established by Washington, who upon retiring after 2 terms (he could have easily managed a third) quipped "I did not fight George III to become George I."
</li></ul></li><li> In Luxembourg, there were four Grand Dukes named William (Guillaume) with the current heir to the throne set to be the fifth. The first three were also Kings of the Netherlands.
