The character's motivations run the gamut from understandable to reprehensible: sometimes they're just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">clingy</a> and/or desperate to get hitched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking">or have a child</a>; other times they feel the relationship is on the rocks and believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">babies make everything better</a>; still other times they feel the pregnancy will establish a claim on the other person (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">or their resources</a>, such as pursuing an inheritance or child support payments) or make it harder for him/her to leave. In accordance with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">Law of Inverse Fertility</a>, attempting this even once will invariably result in pregnancy, with all attendant drama.
</p><p>A variation involves a woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePregnancy">faking a pregnancy</a> with the intention of faking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">convenient miscarriage</a> after the wedding, or actually being pregnant but lying about who the father is. Can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">shotgun wedding</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">very special episode</a> about abortion or adoption, but more often drama or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity ensues</a>, depending on what sort of show we're dealing with.

</p><p>The character doing this is usually female, often a teenage girl, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">gender stereotypes</a> that say all women are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking">desperate to get married and have babies</a> while all men flee commitment as long as they can. (This is dependent upon several factors within real life, such as abortion rights. These laws can cause a huge imbalances in agency, whereas either a woman has all control over what happens within her body or none at all. This can also put pressure on the father as well, who has to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal">make an "honest woman"</a> of her or take financial responsibility.) Because of this, female characters who are disliked by their male partner's friends or family may be suspected of plotting to use this trope on him even if there's no evidence of any such thing. The moral tone also depends on several factors, such as the gender doing the trapping and the circumstances in which the sex took place. For example, a man who traps a woman is portrayed as planting something within her body that she <em>does not</em> want there. The greater problems of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">Double Standard Rape</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">Marital Rape License</a> also create deeper concerns which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">we will NOT get into here</a>.

Condoms are designed so that failure is usually obvious. Most of the time, using a condom with even a small hole will result in the whole thing shredding apart under use.
</p><p>It's quite easy, however, to stop taking birth control pills without telling the partner, which is also a common form of this trope.

<ul><li> Carol Leifer, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> inspiration for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Elaine Benes</a>, had this variant:
<div class="indent"><em>He tricked me into marrying him. He told me he was pregnant.</em>
</div></li><li> Comedy writer/standup Ali Wong talked about this trope throughout her standup special "Baby Cobra". Specifically, she talked about turning her dating life around from the losers she used to date when she met her husband and going out of her way to be sure to get into a relationship with him and get him to propose to her because he had much better prospects for the future than any man she might otherwise date. She specifically, and repeatedly, describes it as "trapping" him, with the hope that thanks to his business background she could retire early and still live a happy, prosperous life of comfort. But at the very end of the special, it turns into a subversion when she describes discovering that his Harvard education had left him massively in debt and they would, in fact, be relying on <em>her</em> money from writing for shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreshOffTheBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreshOffTheBoat">Fresh Off the Boat</a></em> to take care of it.
<div class="indent">Worked hard to trap his ass, got him to propose to me, oh my God, then we got married, my dream is coming true, then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And two weeks into the escrow process, I learned that my beautiful, Harvard educated husband was <em>seventy thousand dollars</em> in debt. And me, with my hard earned T.V. money, wound up paying it all off. [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>] So as it turns out, he's the one who trapped <em><strong>me!</strong></em> ... Now if I don't work, we die! Why else do think I'm doing this show while seven and a half months pregnant?!
</div><ul><li> Her second special, <em>Hard Knock Wife</em> goes further into it. She jokes about how her husband knows how loaded she is and so doesn't give a fuck about himself in his business life and he knows his wife is totally loaded. She darkly admits the irony of trying to trap him but in reality trapped herself into a marriage that she is at the least very happy with.

<ul><li> Subverted in the case of her daughter Lian, who wasn't planned.

Her goal was to torment Roy, first by revealing their child's existence but never letting Roy near them, later by feeding Roy the barest details about Lian's development and how all of it was happening without him. Even after Roy gained permanent custody of Lian, Cheshire was still capable of manipulating Roy by relying on her connection to Lian.
</li><li> Played straight with her son Tommy, who was deliberately conceived for this trope. While being blackmailed into joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a>, Cheshire singled out Catman as the most desirable candidate and seduced him to get pregnant again. She did this for two reasons. The first being that she would now have <em>a</em> child in case Mockingbird followed through on his threat to detonate a bomb in Lian's head. The second that she would rely on Catman to protect her from the Six's eventual retaliation after she betrayed them to the Secret Society.

Unusually for this trope, the baby's birth would have been a boon for every party involved: Sabina gets an Heir and Mariella as the mother gets to spend her life in comfort and safety. Unfortunately, the Prince wasn't keen on acknowledging he fathered a bastard, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so he brutally mind-wiped Mariella and abandoned her to die in a slum, with her son who later grows up to become Xanxus of the Vongola.</span>

</li><li> One weird example: In the movie <em>French Twist</em>, a lesbian asks her girlfriend's husband to get her pregnant. The film then picks up again after she's had the baby, and ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the four of them (lesbian, girlfriend, husband, and baby) living together happily.</span>
<ul><li> The original release also has the husband being seduced by a guy. This was left out of the American release, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">obvious reasons</a>.
</li><li> Another weird example: in the movie <em>A Home At The End Of The World</em> a gay man named Johnathan is attempting to get his best friend, a straight woman named Clare, pregnant so they can both raise the baby together. When Jonathan's old boyfriend Bobby enters their life and also begins a sexual relationship with Clare, it obviously creates huge discourse within the trio. When Johnathan has finally had enough a threatens to leave them both, Clare reveals that she's pregnant, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although she doesn't mention who the father is</span>. This causes both Bobby and Johnathan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">put aside their differences and they all raise the baby together as a family unit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DropDeadFred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DropDeadFred">Drop Dead Fred</a></em>, the reason Lizzie's mother Polly was so cruel to her was because she used this trick to try and save her marriage. When it didn't work, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">she placed the blame squarely on her daughter's shoulders</a>.

</li><li> In the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InterviewWithTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InterviewWithTheVampire">Interview with the Vampire</a></em>, Lestat seems to first see Claudia as the "baby" for his version of this, to force Louis to stay with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">It's interesting.</a>

One of his friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">explicitly compares</a> the situation to a woman who attempts to get pregnant in hopes of fixing a failing marriage.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golddigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golddigger">gold-digging</a> titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTeacher">Bad Teacher</a> mentions that she tried doing something like this to basketball players (as mentioned below), but that they were always smart enough to make sure that the condom was intact <em>and</em> to take it with them after the deed was complete.
</li><li> Diana, the mother in <em>Too Close to Home</em>, believes that this was pulled on her son to get him to marry his child's mother. This was averted since the son's wife confessed to her pregnancy after he asked her to marry him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRedPill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRedPill">The Red Pill</a></em>:
<ul><li> Activists within the film argue that if a woman enacts this on a man, he has pretty much no legal recourse from being saddled with a child he didn't want or wasn't prepared for. In some cases, a man is legally obligated to care for a child even if he isn't the biological father.
</li><li> Activists mention France's banning of "at-will" paternity tests without a court order, which limits options for men to prove actual paternity.
</li><li> One of the activists in the film Jaye interviews alleges that it was done to him by his own wife, who trapped him in their marriage through getting pregnant, and then describes the hell she put him through in their custody battle.

<ul><li> Parade's End: in England before WWI, a beautiful but manipulate socialite tricks a wealthy aristocrat into marrying her when she discovers she's pregnant after having a quickie with him after a chance meeting on a train. Worst still the baby may not even be his due to the woman's promiscuous ways, though he does leave her for another woman he actually loves in the end.
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Egalia's Daughters</em> - men are the ones responsible for oral contraception and have to earn a woman's approval to become social fathers to a child. There is a very tragic male character who works as a teacher, and one of the boys in his class is his biological son, with whom he had no contact prior to that.
</li><li> Mentioned at the beginning of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> book.
<ul><li> Used by Drefan Rahl's mother with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darken Rahl</a>. Her theory was that if she could give birth to a magically gifted child and heir, Darken Rahl would shower her with riches and status. When Drefan was born and found to be non-gifted, his mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">began to realize</a> that her new son was now a liability and that her master plan was probably not the smartest thing she'd ever done. Before Darken Rahl found out about the child, she brought him to a remote monastery to be raised by monks and, in perpetual fear of the infinitely creative ways Darken Rahl would end her life if she were found, poisoned herself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drefan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">turned out like his father</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few romance novels have this trope, usually with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">Babies Make Everything Better</a> ending.
<ul><li> However, one case that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deals with the aftermath of this</a> is <em>Sisters Found</em>, where one of the lead characters had been adopted for just this reason. When it wasn't enough for the adoptive father to stay, the adoptive mother became an alcoholic and resented the hell out of her daughter. To make things worse, said daughter later finds out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she was the only one of identical triplets to be given up - one of the other two had a medical problem and the cost of hospital bills was such that it was either give up one child or lose them all when Social Services saw they couldn't support their family</span>. Not surprisingly, she has <em>major</em> commitment/abandonment issues.
</li><li> In <em>The Secret Love Child</em>, the hero either sabotages the condom or simply chooses not to tell the heroine that it broke. Naturally, she gets pregnant. Naturally, they get together and it is All Very Romantic. Luckily she apparently really really wanted to have babies.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em>, the novel at least, Scarlett kicks herself for not thinking of this as a means of marrying Ashley after someone tells her about Rhett refusing to marry a girl he "ruined".
</li><li> From Thomas Hardy's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudeTheObscure">Jude the Obscure</a></em>: Arabella, acting on the advice of her friends, uses this ploy to get Jude Fawley to marry her. It works but, oddly enough, she forgets about the baby till Jude reminds her months later. She just makes up a miscarriage and he believes her. At first.
<ul><li> Though she's certainly not above doing it, it's a bit more ambiguous than that, since she tells her friends (to whom she has no reason to lie) that she genuinely thought herself pregnant. It gets weirder though when eight years later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after they've divorced, she tells him that they did indeed have a child together, born after they were separated, and could he please look after the kid now?</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A male example: in <em>Morality Meat</em> by James Tiptree Jr., a woman gets pregnant because her boyfriend pokes holes in the condoms. She found out about it after she heard him tell a friend to "keep his women a little bit pregnant". Classy.

<ul><li> In <em>Welcome to Temptation</em>, this happens twice. The main male character (many years before the book starts) marries his girlfriend at the time who becomes pregnant after lying to him about using birth control. A minor main character also marries a girlfriend who claims she's pregnant (also many years earlier), despite being in love with someone else. As the book puts it, "Eleven months later, sure enough, she had a baby."

<ul><li> This is speculated by Dumbledore to be the reason Merope Gaunt stops giving Tom Riddle Sr. love potions. She did it in the hope that he had really fallen in love with her, or would at least stay for the sake of the child she was pregnant with. Turns out he did neither.
</li><li> It's also speculated that this was the reason the Muggles of Tom Riddle Sr.'s village used to explain why he inexplicably abandoned his previous girlfriend and ran off with a poor girl who lived in a shack - that Merope lied to him that she was pregnant with his child.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy">Maeve Binchy</a> novel <em>Circle Of Friends</em>, after being ditched by her lover and not wanting to have an abortion, a desperate Nan seduces Jack<em>her best friend's boyfriend</em>and tells him he's the baby's father, knowing that he'll do the right thing and offer to marry her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAgeOfInnocence">The Age of Innocence</a></em>, Newland Archer expresses his desire to give up his law practice and travel the world (what he really wants to do is escape his loveless marriage and follow his wife's cousin Ellen to Paris). His wife May gently tells him, "I'm afraid you can't, dear. Not unless you take me with you. That is if the doctors will let me go..." thus revealing that she's pregnant.
</li><li> The third book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSchoolForGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSchoolForGoodAndEvil">The School for Good and Evil</a></em> series reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main characters, Sophie and Agatha, are the result of this. Their mother Vanessa orchestrated a one-night stand with Stefan, the man she was obsessed with, so he would have to marry her. When she could only give birth to stillborns, Vanessa took a fertility potion and had twin girls, abandoning the ugly one but keeping the beautiful one to save her marriage. While Stefan stayed for his daughter's sake, like all Vanessa's past and future attempts, it failed to make him love his wife.</span>
</li><li> A particularly dark example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot">'Salem's Lot</a></em>, where Reggie Sawyer punishes his wife for her adultery by repeatedly beating and raping her...after flushing her birth control pills down the toilet.

</li><li> Meggie essentially pulls this on Luke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds">The Thorn Birds</a></em>, hoping that a pregnancy will make him leave the cane fields and settle down with her. It doesn't work at all—he's angry about it, given that he made it quite clear that he wanted to wait until they were financially secure before having children, and he doesn't change his behavior one bit.

Later, she and Turk have an open and honest discussion in which they agree they both want to have kids ... after which he starts slipping her contraceptives when she's asleep.
<ul><li> This is completely inverted with Jordan, who actually lies to Perry and claims the baby isn't his, because they both have feelings for each other and she wants to make sure their relationship is based on real attraction rather than an obligation to do the right thing. They get together anyway, and he bonds with the baby before finding out he's the biological father.
</li><li> Also inverted with Kim, who leaves the hospital and fakes a miscarriage rather than have J.D. feel trapped into a relationship. Then he finds out the truth and decides he wants to be with her, then he changes his mind but can't tell her, then he finally breaks off the relationship <em>while she's giving birth</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A variation in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> episode "4x4". An aging non-prostitute tries to get herself pregnant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by a client who rejected her as too old, via some semen in one of his used condoms</span>.

<ul><li> Inverted in the case of Edie, who convinced Carlos to stay with her by promising she'd have a baby with him but continued secretly taking birth control.
</li><li> For a bit of irony, before the incident with Edie, Carlos managed to get Gabrielle pregnant by sabotaging her birth control, then blaming it on his deceased mother. He wanted children, and she didn't. It ends badly for everyone involved.

In Chakotay's case, the baby is used as bait for a <em>literal</em> trap, as she's counting on <em>Voyager</em> to come rescue him so that the Kazon can seize the ship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's Culluh's, and Seska's manipulations end when she's mortally wounded in an explosion, and Culluh escapes with his son.</span>

It was implied that she insisted that the man use the condom she provided when they had sex, and she had intentionally damaged the condom to produce a child, all for the money. When the man requested that she give him sole custody of the child, she got big 'money eyes' and quoted a price of five million dollars.

In one episode, the wife sabotaged her husband's condoms and secretly gave him some fertility drugs to boost his sperm count in order to impregnate her boss. She did this because she had planned on blackmailing her boss at a later date into giving her some money so she could buy a farm and a horse.
<ul><li> Another episode was about a woman who got pregnant by her rich boyfriend. She chose to keep the baby despite the fact that she was aware the baby might have a potentially serious birth defect, and even went out of her way to find a doctor who wouldn't run the relevant tests. Then, when her husband died and she wanted more money, she tried to sue the aforementioned doctor for malpractice for not running said tests.

<ul><li> Emily later does the same thing when Daniel decides to call off the wedding because he realized that he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend.

When Daniel finds out the truth, he takes it very badly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and shoots Emily</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em> came up with a pretty good, if extremely far fetched argument for a court-ordered abortion, possibly inspired by one of the real life examples below. A woman gave her boyfriend oral sex (to which he "barely consented"), then spat the semen into a cup and used it to impregnate herself and didn't tell him until she knew it worked. The man argued that he was tricked into impregnating the woman, and additionally, it imposed a dilemma upon him, as he was known to be outspoken on the issue of absentee black fathers and would have to choose between being a hypocrite or help raise a baby he didn't want. The judge admitted that the case was compelling, but not quite enough to warrant the extreme measure of ordering the woman to undergo an abortion.
</li><li> Stacey attempts this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey">Gavin &amp; Stacey</a></em>; they're already married, but were living a long distance apart, and she wanted him to move to Wales to live with her. To make it worse, she's been trying to get pregnant for a <em>year</em> without his knowledge.

The woman was trying to extort child-support hush money from Mork, and poor Mork was too naive to know that Earth women don't get pregnant if you don't have sex with them.
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SingleFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SingleFather">Single Father</a></em>, Rita mentions to Sarah that she wants another baby and intends to have one without talking to her partner about it. Sarah expresses shock, but it's revealed at the end of the series that Sarah purposely got pregnant by Dave and didn't intend to tell him.

He's not particularly interested in staying in a relationship with any of these women, he just thinks the world would benefit from having lots of his offspring around. He personally thinks that he's a great father, as he financially supports all of them, but the mothers, naturally, don't. It finally ends badly for him, when one of the women he was trying to get pregnant decides to strike back. Also sort of done in another episode where a 16-year-old was raped by her dentist uncle and was trying to get him to confess while cops were listening. At first, he denies everything until she mentions being late and pregnant. He tells her to calm down and that she can't possibly be pregnant due to him having gotten a vasectomy. Whoops. Nick sums it up nicely: <em>I've never met a bad man that wasn't afraid of a baby.</em> Read more: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=law-and-order-special-victims-unit&amp;episode=s16e13">https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=law-and-order-special-victims-unit&amp;episode=s16e13<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, after Adalind gets pregnant with Sean Renard's child, she tries to pass it off as the child of Sean's half-brother Eric, the rightful son of the King, especially since she's currently sleeping with Eric in order to get in the Royals' good graces. After Eric's death, some of the Royals wonder who the real father is, but, in the end, it doesn't matter to them, since the child is still a Renard and has Royal blood. Later, after she finds out she's pregnant with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nick</span>'s baby, she tries to pass it off as Viktor's (Eric's cousin) child, despite the fact that they never had sex. Kenneth (another Royal) tells her, in a "by the way" manner, that Viktor is sterile.

While it works temporarily, friend Terrence browbeats her into admitting that she's lying, telling her that she is not the kind of cruel, deceitful person to pull a stunt like this.
<ul><li> Allie tries to pull this on Jake by not wearing her diaphragm. It backfired in two ways — when he found it after they had sex and dumped her, angry at her attempt at pulling this trope, and when she failed to conceive.
</li><li> Speaking of Jake, when ex-girlfriend Liza asks him to father her baby (the very reason that the jealous Allie tried to pull the above-mentioned stunt), her ex-husband Adam enlists Allie to switch Jake's sperm sample for his. Liza unwittingly ends up pregnant with Adam's baby and not until after they've remarried and she's given birth does she learn the truth. She's horrified and outright says that Adam raped her.
</li><li> Kendall tries to pull this with Anton... and, of course, it doesn't work. He doesn't believe her for a second, given how diligent she was about taking the pill. She caves in pretty quickly and tells the truth once he drags her to the doctor, who needs to give her a full set of tests <em>and</em> a needle, but Kendall is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles">Afraid of Needles</a> and freaks out, admitting she's lying.
</li><li> Taylor tries to pull this on Noah, but it fails—he leaves her for Julia anyway, even though he makes it clear that he's not abandoning her and the baby. She desperately seduces a friend of hers hoping that <em>he'll</em> get her pregnant and she can pass the baby off as Noah's, but she fails to conceive from that either and ultimately has to resort to lying that she miscarried.

<ul><li> A variation when Sheila did not intentionally get pregnant and is genuinely shocked to learn that she is. But sure enough, she uses her pregnancy to successfully drive a wedge between the baby's father and his wife.
</li></ul></li><li> A rare version on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em>, where the man <em>knew</em> that he wasn't the father. After a teenage girl was raped, she only confided in her friend. When she learned she was pregnant, he claimed he was the father to spare her the humiliation of telling everyone what had happened to her. Desperate for some TLC after her ordeal, she began using the pregnancy to draw closer to him. When she miscarried after falling down, she blamed it on his girlfriend, putting the final nail in the coffin of their relationship, until she finally admitted that she'd tripped on her own, rather than being shoved.
</li><li> Like the <em>All My Children</em> example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em> had Annie damaging her diaphragm rather than the condom. It backfired for the same reason — husband Josh had told her he wanted to wait to have kids and her deception was the last straw. She miscarried and framed his ex Reva for manslaughter by making it look like she'd pushed her down the stairs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em> had Blair ensnaring Todd this way to get her hands on his money. Todd became suspicious after her ex-husband Asa warned him that Blair had pulled the same stunt on him and demanded that she take a pregnancy test. Much to her shock and relief, it was positive—Blair had in fact conceived at some point. But she was still found out months later when she miscarried and Todd realized she wasn't as far along as she should have been.

</li></ul></li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a>,</em> this is what got the victim killed. She was sleeping with a foreign diplomat's husband, who showered her with gifts until he got bored with it. Her mother advised her that he'd do the right thing, so she attempted to reseduce him. When that didn't work, she went after his son instead.
</li><li> An unusual version on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigLove">Big Love</a></em>. Despite already being married to Bill and having two children with him, Nikki claims she wants another baby, even though she doesn't.

She even provides him with a potion to supercharge Phoebe's fertility and "bypass any precautions she may have taken." And the pregnancy is a major factor in Phoebe's decision to remain loyal to Cole and (temporarily) become the Queen of Hell. But ultimately, the Seer wanted the baby for herself so that she could use it to legitimately claim the title of Source, and even though possessed-Cole willingly went along with the plan, his goal wasn't to manipulate Phoebe, only to have a child (albeit, an extremely powerful one).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Years back in Texas, a man was required to pay child support after a woman performed oral sex on him and then inseminated herself with the gathered sperm after he left. He didn't find out that they had a daughter until <em>years</em> later after she sued for child support.
<ul><li> The German version of the same story is even more famous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis ace Boris Becker</a> gave the male part, making him the butt of countless jokes.
</li><li> Similarly, in 2013 Kansas started a lawsuit to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/04/us/kansas-sperm-donation">make a sperm donor pay for child-support<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when the woman he'd donated to requested financial assistance from the State. Interestingly, this is being done <em>solely</em> by the State, over the objections of all involved parties, and declaring a signed contract null-and-void in the process due to the phrasing of its sperm donor laws.
</li></ul></li><li> Does happen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, tragically more often with abusive couples <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">who believe that a baby will force their partner to stay</a>. Sadly, they're sometimes right, especially when their partner would have financial troubles or lose custody of the child if they left. Some women will deliberately get pregnant to get child support off of the man since it tends to also qualify her for other forms of government assistance (assuming she's not too wealthy). While laws are slowly becoming more gender neutral, the man will probably lose anyway if the woman was someone he just had a fling with, and so this is exploited by some women. The CDC's 2010 <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf">Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> found that approximately 4.8% of women and 8.7% of men had a sexual partner who tried to get them pregnant or get pregnant against their will.
<ul><li> Possibly related to this, there is an increasing number of men who have chosen to get vasectomies in their early twenties. Since the childfree are still something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget">Acceptable Target</a>, many doctors will outright refuse to perform them under the belief that the man will always change his mind. For a woman who hasn't had children as well, it is next to impossible to convince a doctor to permanently sterilise her. Many doctors are very insistent that <em>everyone really wants babies</em>, or are wary of being sued by a patient whom they sterilise then later changes his/her mind.
</li></ul></li><li> Crosses over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a> territory with abusive men who intentionally impregnate their female partner in order to make her stay, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Rape</a> is common in abusive relationships. The reverse is possible as well.
</li><li> The Department of Defense is very aware of the Baby Trap, particularly in regards to the service academies of West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy. Cadets at these institutions are told in no uncertain terms that marrying while a cadet means being automatically dismissed from their school. Not only is this because the male cadets have absolutely zero time for a wife, but also to make them aware that they have to be very, very careful. Female cadets who get pregnant are also automatically dismissed.
</li><li> Unfortunately common in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> and Japanese rock/metal scene and with hosts, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirls</a> and <em>mitsu</em> (women paying hosts/musicians for sex) have found out that under Japanese law, they have 100 percent rights to the child (even if the father actually wants the child and/or the mother is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a>), can often force a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a> to the artist or at the very least demand ongoing child support payments (which often itself forces a wedding and short marriage, if the man was dependent on them, to begin with), and because many men in Japan, including hosts and musicians, prefer condomless sex in the first place. Smarter cisgender men who work as hosts/do mitsu/sleep around <em>do</em> keep their own condoms and use them, or get vasectomies, for this very reason.
</li><li> A common theme among many stories of professional athletes going broke, despite making tens of millions of dollars in salaries/bonuses/endorsements, is fathering multiple children with multiple women, many of whom seek to get pregnant in order to be able to extract child support payments. One former NFL player has <em>ten</em> children. By <em>ten</em> different women. This often leads to declaring bankruptcy or being arrested for failure to pay child support.
</li><li> There was a case of a man suing a woman over lying to him that she was on birth control and then demanding child support. While the judge was sympathetic to the man, he still ruled in favor of the woman, pointing out that he was more concerned with the welfare of the child, who would suffer if deprived of child support payments.
</li><li> In a rather infamous case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> was sued by a woman over a backstage encounter which resulted in a child. Unfortunately for her, what she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">failed to take into account</a> was that, according to the date she provided for the encounter, he was 16 and she 19, meaning that if it were true she would be guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">statutory rape</a> (and, of course, if it wasn't true, she would be guilty of defamation and extortion).
