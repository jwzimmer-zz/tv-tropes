</div></div><p>A pacing problem that occurs when the beginning of a story is so front-loaded with bland <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">exposition</a> and details about the world contained within, that it takes forever to finally reach the interesting part of the story that puts all of that information to good use. In other words, this is a specific type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">Infodump</a> that occurs at the beginning of a story.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This can understandably take a while to get through, and you may well have lost heart before you manage it. It might be worth sticking around though: there are more than a few works that are seen as being one of the best in their genre/medium that suffer from this trope, only revealing their true greatness once you manage to slog through all the setup. But that tends to be the exception, not the rule; and either way, the writer probably doesn't do themselves any favours by boring their audience at the start. As many writers will tell you, the first line of a book will often decide whether it gets published or not.
</p><p>Sometimes, though, this pacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction">can be used deliberately</a>. Maybe the writer <em>wants</em> to establish the hero's former life as slow, tedious and mundane before they discover their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>. Or, in the case of historical fiction, the writer wants to ensure that the reader doesn't need the Encyclopedia Britannica close to hand to understand what's going on. But, once again, deliberately making the beginning of your story boring is a <em>very</em> risky game; it can take quite a tenacious audience to deal with this in the blind hope that your story will eventually have things happen in it. And if their patience is wearing thin by that point, their reaction may be less happiness that such tenacity was rewarded and more annoyance that you made them wait for so long.

<ul><li> The first four episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> are somewhat slow, focusing on character interactions and world-building. Once the Titans show up in Episode 5 and all hell breaks loose, though, the show picks up and becomes a much more enjoyable watch. Though this only occurs in the anime; in the manga, the author chose to put the training mini-arc after the Trost battle was over, probably because he precisely wanted to avoid this trope. The drawback being that we are introduced to a lot of characters we don't know anything about right off the bat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> takes a while to get going due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a> episodic feel at the start where Team Touden is mainly just going around the dungeon's first floors killing and eating whatever monster they come across. It only starts to delve into deeper storytelling once they encounter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Orc Chief in chapter 9, and Kabru's party gets introduced in chapter 10. The Red Dragon arc though is where things really get kicked up a notch.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> starts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> show with mons, battling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> and exploring the character's lives and personalities. Then they go to the Digital World with lots of hopes and dreams. THEN, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Episode 34</a> happens and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">everything</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">gets</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">weird</a>. The difference is quite shocking, to say the least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this was intentional.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>. In its earliest episodes, it seems like an average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Shōnen</a> series with a whiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Emo Teen</a> protagonist; however, it improves as we learn more about the characters and their world, and it's the love story between Renton and Eureka that really sells it.
</li><li> Season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> is pretty slow due to the large amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler episodes</a> and plot rearrangements done to keep the show from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">overtaking the manga</a>, which was in the middle of the Cassandra Arc at the time,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0v7lq');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0v7lq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0v7lq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Golan &amp; Jackal arcs were moved to the middle of Season 1, rather than occurring between Shin's defeat and Kenshiro's meeting with Mamiya.</span> and the rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation">shoddy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">animation</a> can be very off-putting to a first-time viewer. However, after Shin's defeat in the season finale, the show really picks things up and the rest of the show is faster-paced and more faithful to the source work, and the animation gradually starts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">improve</a> after the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a> that came with the first Kenshiro vs. Raoh fight. Comparing the first season to the fourth, the latter is considerably better-paced, with filler being carefully intertwined with the source material's plot rather than having every filler story get pasted somewhere in the middle, and the animation is very detailed and pleasing to look at compared to Season 1's.
</li><li> An inverted example with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em>. One problem several people have with the show is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">its first thirteen episodes cram about thirty chapters worth of material into them</a>, compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">which takes around thirty episodes to cover and expand the same amount of material with some light</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a>, resulting in the first fifth or so of <em>Brotherhood</em> coming across at a rushed pace. This can be particularly troublesome for those who are more familiar with the 2003 anime than the manga and aren't aware of the second one being more faithful. Once <em>Brotherhood</em> fully diverges from what was shown in the 2003 anime, however, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">some material is still trimmed</a>, it gradually slows down to a much more manageable pace without seeming too drastic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em> appears to have attempted this, and suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">Cosmic Deadline</a>. It starts out very slowly and ends on quite an action-packed note, but many fans dropped off before even making it halfway through.
</li><li> The first couple episodes of the 1999 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> anime are rather slow-paced and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">generic</a>, in part due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> of the source material, and also having to establish the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Shōnen</a> tropes it would later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruct</a>. Once things get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">darker</a>, and the deconstructive elements actually start to show, the story and characters become more psychological and compelling (though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> never actually goes away). Also, the second anime has been criticized for repeating the same event from the first anime series while ignoring likable parts and even cutting parts from the first manga chapter. However, after 60 episodes the series will cover for the first time the material the first anime never adapted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IAmAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IAmAHero">I Am a Hero</a></em> spends the first two hundred pages making you suffer through the everyday trials and tribulations of the protagonist before it actually gets on with the plot. To say it starts slow is like saying continental drift takes a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Part 1, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Phantom Blood</a></em> starts off as a generic period drama about an English nobleboy whose life is turned upside-down by his evil adoptive brother Dio Brando; it isn't until Dio becomes a vampire that the manga undergoes a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> into action-horror and the adventure truly becomes as bizarre as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">series title</a> claims.
</li><li> Part 4, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Diamond Is Unbreakable</a></em>, has an unfocused plot at first, with the only overarching goal being finding the bow and arrow, while the heroes encounter a long series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotIrrelevantVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotIrrelevantVillain">Plot Irrelevant Villains</a> who only get minor appearances afterwards (if they show up again at all). But once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Yoshikage Kira, makes his appearance, everything gets kicked up a notch and for this reason, part 4 is a common sight in the high rankings of many a fan's favorite parts list.

</li><li> Pacing issues like this are one of the biggest obstacles for new readers of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> manga; the first few volumes of the series are a fairly generic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>-ish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> comedy series, and the actual plot doesn't show up until around at least chapter 15, and even then it isn't until around half a dozen volumes in that the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">hits its stride</a>. The official translation makes it worse, as the adapter of the first few volumes didn't realize that the early chapters <em>do</em> contain some important characterization and foreshadowing, so a lot of it ended up getting cut, bordering on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a> and making the opening material even weaker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> suffers from a first book/few episodes filled with mustache-twirling villains and a protagonist who is a little bit too pure to be interesting. Fortunately, the villains become more complex and the series pulls back the focus a bit from the overly pure character for some more interesting ones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em> can be difficult for new readers in the beginning due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot">Jigsaw Puzzle Plot</a> nature. Interestingly, it isn't because of a lack of action, but rather because of the many odd occurrences that are given no explanation or context to help the reader understand. The Cheshire Arc is where many fans believe the story truly begins to hit its stride, acting as a clarifying point for what the varying goals of the main characters are, and from there the reading experience improves drastically.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em>, while often considered to be one of the great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalHorror">Psychological Horror</a> movies, and possibly <em>the</em> greatest where anime is concerned, takes a while to pick up. Until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first victim dies</span> about a third of the way in, what we get is mostly exposition and foreshadowing, and the freaky scenes that <em>do</em> pop up almost come off as the filmmakers saying to the audience, "<em>Wait for it</em>..." Once "it" happens, however, the horror really begins, and that's when you see what all the fuss is about.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> has a slow start and poor artwork at the beginning of the manga. It isn't really until Sieg shows up that the series really kicks into gear, even if he leaves shortly afterward. This leads to the infamous Tower of Din arc, and the story escalates from there.
</li><li> It can be very hard for a contemporary viewer to understand the hype behind the original anime for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>. When marathoned, the first few episodes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> and watching the same recycled animation can be very tedious after a while. Once the initial three are assembled though, the story becomes more complex and character driven. When people praise the show, they generally talk about the second half of the first season, as well as R and S. You just have to sit through fifteen boring and repetitive episodes to get there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> gets off to a slow start in both of its seasons, though the exposition and character introductions are interesting. For a show dealing with a giant space Battleship, the Yamato doesn't lift off and fly from earth until the end of the third episode.
</li><li> Very few people have actually made it past the first three episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em>, if not the pilot. It isn't until halfway through the first episode that <em>the first line of dialogue is spoken</em>.
</li><li> There are often complaints that roughly the first third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> (the anime) is silly, stupid and episodic, with only vague allusions to the fact that Vash's story is remotely deep or complicated. With the arrival of Nicholas D. Wolfwood (episode 9), Legato Bluesummers and the Gung-Ho Guns (episode 12), the story arc of the series actually begins.
</li><li> You can read the first couple chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> and then skip around 90 chapters (a little over a third of the manga's run). Story arcs before then have very little to do with the overall larger story, save for a handful of minor events, and can be summed up as "Syaoran and Co. travelled to X world to solve X problem and get a feather".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeddingPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeddingPeach">Wedding Peach</a></em> got a very bad reputation when it first made its way to the West due to this. Animerica magazine slammed the show in its review, although it was clear to anyone acquainted with the series that the reviewer had only seen the first six or seven dubbed episodes. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jama-P stops being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> every episode due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel-Face Turn</a></span> and weddings become simply a motif and not the central focus of each episode, the series improves greatly.
</li><li> The first half of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> was so full of pointless filler duels, it hurts. By the second half of the season, it gets a bit better, and it gets a lot better once season three comes around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> is rather slow-paced for the first 30 or so episodes (basically, every episode generally follows the ZAFT-attacks-Kira-saves-the-day routine; that these episodes are more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake">remake</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">original Gundam series</a> doesn't exactly help), but after a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episodes</a> <em>SEED</em> finally escapes this routine and sets off on a path to its own original, epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. To its defense, the first episodes do a good job of familiarizing and endearing the characters to the audience.
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> stretches 3 chapters into 5 episodes and takes the entire first episode before Asta gets his Grimoire. These episodes are slow and are filled with flashbacks. The series doesn't pick up until Asta joins the Black Bulls and then picks up faster once the Bulls enter the first Dungeon.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> can seem rather directionless, with the humor and pacing kind of awkward for most of the first half, not helped by a rather mediocre English dubbing if you're watching that. By the time Amelia is introduced though, the show starts finding its groove although others think the show only got good when Sylphiel was introduced in episode 18. On top of that, the English dub gets better halfway through the season when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">Veronica Taylor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman">Crispin Freeman</a> join the cast and really give Zel and Amelia their voices. It also starts off a more interesting plot and introduces cooler villains, like Zangulus and Vrumugun, who continue to chase the heroes so even the filler episodes don't feel so pointless. By <em>NEXT</em>, the show really finds its stride, reaching its signature level of humor and solidifying the characters' personalities and quirks, as well as having what is arguably the best plot and character development in the whole franchise.

For most of the first volume, he was struggling to get a sense of the characters and the kinds of stories he wanted to do, and also had to deal with an editorial mandate to include characters from the DC Universe which he found very awkward. But when he got to the final issue of that volume, which introduces Death, suddenly everything clicked for him. He still advises people that the first volume isn't really worth it, though many fans disagree.

It doesn't really kick on until chapter 9 when darker themes are introduced, the plot gets going, it becomes abundantly clear that the forces of good aren't going to have it all their way.

Also, the difficulty he has adjusting to his younger body again is massively exaggerated until he literally can't walk in a straight line without tripping over his own feet, which is distracting and takes far too long to get past. Once Naruto has control of his body again, the story finally gets going.

It's only about the 45-minute mark that Blondie and Tuco finally find out about the buried gold and begin searching for it. Strangely, this is a case where this was not only done deliberately, but it works on a level that allows the film to build atmosphere and character, and even if you get bored by the first part, the main plot just gets better, to the point where the greatest scene in the whole film is saved for the very end.

While this helps to set the scene and provides more characterization for Ophelia and Gertrude, it takes around 30-40 minutes until King Hamlet kicks the bucket, which is the cause of the film's central conflict; it then takes even <em>longer</em> for Hamlet to discover his dad might've been murdered and start plotting revenge (for comparison, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">original play</a> the king has already died when the story begins and Hamlet finds out about the alleged murder in the first act).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers">The Producers</a></em> begins with an unnecessarily long sequence where Bloom engages in a lengthy conversation with Bialystock in order to illustrate how slimy Bialystock is followed by an equally lengthy exposition about how the Broadway scam is supposed to work. On the other hand, it has some of the best lines of the movie ("My blanket! MY BABY BLUE BLANKET!").

The first Evil Ex doesn't appear until about 40 minutes in, making it seem like nothing more than some hipster comedy about a dweeb's love life. The idea is to establish all of Scott's inadequacies and progress his courtship with the unattainable Ramona to the point where he has to fight her evil exes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Them" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Them">Them!</a></em> is a movie about mutated giant ants. Except for the first half hour, where it's a leisurely-paced police procedural set in the New Mexico desert instead.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series: <em>Breaking Dawn Part 2</em> is, for the most part, a fairly banal and boring affair... until you reach the action climax where the movie suddenly decides to kick all kinds of ass.

The first half is a slow and bewildering parade of scenic location footage, nudity, musical numbers, and psychedelic pop music. After that, horror icon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> suddenly shows up in all his ominous glory, things get serious fast, and all the goofy stuff turns out to be set up for some very dark, unsettling payoffs.

Lovecraft</a> novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtTheMountainsOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtTheMountainsOfMadness">At the Mountains of Madness</a></em> starts with an unusual take on this - fifty pages of description of how their scientific expedition was <strong>meant</strong> to go. How it actually went starts around page sixty. He's careful to set this description up so that it works for the book instead of against it, though.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em>: Most of the novel goes into a great deal of detail about cloning and how society works in the future. It takes a while before the main characters even get introduced, then the action begins. Of course, since setting up the dystopia is vital in order to tell a dystopian story, this is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasualVacancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasualVacancy">The Casual Vacancy</a></em>: Most of the story is spent establishing characters and seemingly unimportant plot points. It doesn't really pick up until the last 100 pages, with plot points slowly coming together and the last 75 pages throwing everything you had read and thought unimportant in your face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>: The opening third of the novel is not only busy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopingDoomedCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopingDoomedCharacters">Developing Doomed Characters</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist">Pinball Protagonist</a> but also with establishing the legend of Willy Wonka and the resultant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> of the Golden Ticket contest. Luckily, most of this buildup is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, which eases potential tedium, and once the characters are in the factory, the story becomes a briskly-paced lark.
</li><li> In-universe with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCityOfDreamingBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCityOfDreamingBooks">The City of Dreaming Books</a></em>. The protagonist was told repeatedly by his uncle to read the great novel "Ritter Hempel" (Hempel the knight) but gave up after the first fifty or so pages were all about how to clean lances. Only later he learns that everyone else had the same problem, and later in the book, there are great and funny scenes, like when the knight loses his glasses in his armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CloudAtlas">Cloud Atlas</a></em>: The opening of the novel's six stories seems to be a lot of people's least favourite in the book. It may be that the 17th-century English makes the section a little less accessible than others, and it may be that it's just a function of being the first section: the reader doesn't understand all the significances within on the first read. It might also suffer from being right next to the Robert Frobisher section, which is a fan favourite.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em> includes long diversions into the backstories of many characters in the first half, eventually integral to the plot but difficult to chew on. Most adaptations break them up over the course of the story.
</li><li> Similarly, some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> find the first book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger">The Gunslinger</a></em>, too slow and think that the series doesn't get good until the second book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree">The Drawing of the Three</a></em>. On the other hand, an almost equal number love <em>The Gunslinger</em> because it's so contemplative.
</li><li> This methodical approach works really well for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDayOfTheJackal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDayOfTheJackal">The Day of the Jackal</a></em>, being a novel about an elite assassin. While most thriller novels get more convoluted as they reach their climax, due to the various plot threads coming together, <em>The Day of the Jackal</em> instead gets more focused, all the exposition and plot threads having been dealt with earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> is possibly the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> book to suffer from this. We know he's going to take the position at the bank, it's on the dust-jacket, hell it was foreshadowed at the end of the last book. It is funny at first to see him resisting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Vetinari</a>, but eventually, you want to shout "Get on with it!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> himself has said this about Discworld as a whole, claiming that the earlier books were "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">written by a less talented author</a>". He recommends that new readers bypass some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> and start with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort">Mort</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar">The Dogs of War</a></em> is an excellent example, since it's a novel about a coup in Africa that has several chapters devoted to one character's attempt to buy out a "shell corporation". It's so detailed, it was actually used as the blueprint for at least one real coup attempt.
</li><li> The beginning of Frank Herbert's first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> book is heavily weighted down with this kind of exposition in the first hundred pages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em> has a tendency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">repeating entire passages verbatim over and over</a> (for example, one person would speak to the messenger, and the messenger would then deliver the exact same speech again to his master; there's also the very long-winded title of Gilgamesh, which would be repeated every time someone uses his name). However, this is more due to a quirk of Mesopotamian oral storytelling style (and a feature of oral storytelling in general), than bad writing. The repetition aids memorization for the story-teller and the long titles of heroes make it easier to fit the name in a poetic line (as all epics were written in poetic form).
</li><li> Leon Uris's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Exodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Exodus">Exodus</a></em> is especially bad at this. Early chapters interweave the protagonists' escape from Cyprus with detailed mini-histories of the Holocaust and World War II - at least partially justified as back story for several characters. Then the second "part" of the book stops completely for a 100-page description of modern Zionism from the 1890s through the creation of modern Israel. The novel picks up once the main story starts, but just getting there will exhaust many readers.
</li><li> <em>Final Cut</em> by Steven Bach has a brief prologue about why he needs to find a new movie for United Artists Studios, then spends over a hundred pages going through the entire history of United Artists before getting back to the studio's slow downfall.
</li><li> The first chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em> deal with the backstory of the sea captain who met the titular Doctor on his expedition to find the North Pole. If you didn't know that the novel was a Story Within a Story, you would read the opening wondering "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">What does this have to do with the Monster?</a>"
</li><li> Readers may react in this way to several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a> stories. The author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">researches his subjects so thoroughly</a> that the reader usually earns the equivalent of a Ph.D. in history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdessaFile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdessaFile">investigative journalism</a>, corporate espionage or prospective mining just by reading the first three chapters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> is like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">the Civil War</a> in real time, but the beginning is especially slow. It takes an awful lot of description about high society life on a rural plantation before the readers see any actual fighting. The book is explicitly a view of life in the South before and after the civil war from the civilian point of view. While the war starts a few chapters into the book, the hardships and realities of war start escalating as the book goes on. Life doesn't get much better after the war ends about halfway through the novel either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em> seems to take <em>forever</em> to just get to the Joads, wasting a whole chapter on a freaking <em>turtle crossing a road</em>. Then due to pacing problems of the Joad plot, the chapters about turtles and angry car salesmen with no names end up being the best parts of the book for a lot of people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations">Great Expectations</a></em> takes a while to really get moving, despite a pretty action-packed first chapter. As a result of its serial nature, the first two parts rely heavily on building suspense that pays off in the third part (where nearly every chapter has a plot twist or revelation).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first book notably opens with an extended sequence showing the life of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and overall it's about forty pages before Harry even gets to Hogwarts. Notably, the film drops the Dursley sequence, opening with Dumbledore and McGonagall delivering Harry to Privet Drive.
</li><li> The fourth book's summer portions last longer than the previous three - and it's not until the eleventh chapter that Harry and friends go back to school. It's not until the eighth chapter that the first really plot-relevant thing happens - the attack at the Quidditch World Cup.
</li></ul></li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> series have over a dozen viewpoint characters, and each book or major section typically starts out with a little vignette for each of them, just to remind you of the position they were in at the end of the previous book. If you're lucky, the end of these sections will feature a big change for the character, or even kill them off if you're even luckier; sometimes it just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">does not get better</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series can be like this, depending on how much you like politics. Each is at least several hundred pages long, and in one instance, a book for which the title and back cover talk all about Honor being captured, said capture doesn't happen until the last 100 or so pages of the book. In <em>War Of Honor</em>, the first 450 pages or so go by without a shot being fired, being spent instead on the politics leading up to the resumption of hostilities. While the political junkies are rubbing their hands in glee, the action junkies are sitting around thinking, "Someone shoot at <em>somebody</em> so something actually <em>happens</em>."
<ul><li> Much of the first book is spent explaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">in excruciating detail</a> just how space travel, artificial gravity, and ship-to-ship combat work in this universe, in addition to explaining the workings of a Royal Manticoran Navy starship, the political complications brought on by the Baselisk System, and of course, setting up the background behind the impending war between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Peoples Republic of Haven... which wouldn't start until the third book of the series (the second book had more <em>para bellum</em> posturing, but was much more action-packed).
</li></ul></li><li> Several reviewers have commented that beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost">The Host</a></em> is weaker than the rest of the novel.
</li><li> Proof that great literature isn't immune to this: Robert Graves' novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> begins with a massive history lesson that barely mentions the title character. Still, the history lesson provides enough murder, bloodlust and political conspiracy to tide the viewer over until Claudius introduces himself properly...and then things <em>really</em> get interesting. It might also raise a smile at the end of the book when Claudius (a historian) says that one of the perks of becoming Emperor is that he can make everyone read his history books, and is out and out Lampshaded when Claudius mentions a few dozen pages into the book that he has written several chapters of his autobiography and hasn't quite got up to the point where he is born.
<ul><li> Done again in the sequel <em>Claudius the God</em> where, after having one page describing him being carried off by the army to be declared Emperor, he sees an old friend of his, Herod Agrippa. The next five chapters are devoted to relating Herod's life story up to that point. Though again, the story is entertaining enough to be worth it and the character will be of great importance later on. Notably, the Television Adaptation just starts with Herod.

For the record, it's entirely skippable as it has almost no relevance to the rest of the poem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>: The first book,<em>Eragon</em>, suffers from a bad case of this. After we're introduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Eragon</a> and he finds the dragon egg in the first chapter (and following the prologue where Arya teleports away the egg before being captured by Durza) the egg doesn't hatch until the fourth chapter. It then takes <em>ten more chapters</em> for Eragon to find out he's a dragon rider and set out on his quest with Brom, which forms the main plot. And the book has <em>fifty-nine</em> chapters in all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">over 500 pages</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0b6cq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0b6cq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0b6cq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the Knopf edition has 509 pages, the Paolini LLC edition has 544 </span> A lot of the content in the first fourteen chapters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">isn't all that important to the overall plot</a> (mostly describing life in Carvahall and such) and could have been trimmed or cut to move things along more briskly; the thirteenth chapter in particular consists solely of Eragon angsting about his uncle's death and could easily have been merged with another chapter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Jack Ryan</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears">The Sum of All Fears</a></em>, a 700-page book, the first 500 pages are devoted to the miserable personal life of the main character. Then the action starts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClearAndPresentDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClearAndPresentDanger">Clear and Present Danger</a></em> Tom devotes nearly a chapter to the history and exploits of USCGC Panache captain Red Wegener, along with a backstory about a journalist on his ship... and Wegener goes on to play a relatively minor role in the remainder of the book. He gets about five seconds of screen time in the movie (and is played by a woman about 20 years younger than he would have been).
</li><li> Captain Tupolev's introduction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em> comes to mind as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em> is notorious for this, especially among those that read it for a school assignment. The entire first half of the novel is about Jane's awful guardians and experiences at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors">Boarding School of Horrors</a>, all of which have very little bearing on the much more famous Rochester plot apart from establishing Jane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobie</a> status.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JonathanStrangeAndMrNorrell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JonathanStrangeAndMrNorrell">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a></em> has this effect on a lot of people, with the first quarter of the story taken up by the fussy and passive Mr. Norrell struggling to get British aristocracy to pay attention to his magic. Mr. Strange doesn't show up until about 250 pages in, and the action doesn't pick up until a good four hundred pages in.
</li><li> A good deal of the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheEarth">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a></em> is the heroes' journey from their home in Germany to the Icelandic volcano they want to explore. Except for the acquisition of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">third adventurer</a>, nothing of importance happens in all this time and the whole first section can be skipped over without missing anything.
</li><li> Very common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em> novels; each part in a chapter (and there are many parts in any given chapter) usually has paragraphs interspersed through it focusing on nothing but philosophy and concepts, which even pop up in the middle of a <em>very</em> heated life-and-death battle. This is actually prevalent throughout Nasu's writing, not just <em>Kara No Kyoukai</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastAndFirstMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastAndFirstMen">Last and First Men</a></em> is remembered for its daring depictions of future human species, but first it recounts the future history of our current civilization (the First Men), which is nowhere near as interesting and can be quite grating due to its highly stereotypical depiction of the individual nations' "innate character."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em>, the first sentence of <em>Triplanetary</em> begins "Two thousand million or so years ago" (and based on our current understanding of the history of the Solar System, it really should have been at least "Five thousand million"). It skips pretty rapidly through time after that, with short stops in Atlantis, the Roman Empire, World War II and World War III (which, given the dating in the book, should have happened by now already) before settling down to some point in the indefinite future for the rest of the book. However, the <em>entire first book</em> is about the ancestors of the eventual main protagonists of the series and can be summed up as "The Arisians are Good and the Eddorians are Bad; Gharlane of Eddore in particular has been mucking up Earth's history for a Very Long Time Indeed."
</li><li> The central character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> doesn't appear until after seventy pages spent introducing a minor character who shortly thereafter disappears from the book. This keeps happening, as when the Battle of Waterloo is described in meticulous detail before returning to the plot, which is why the book is 1200 pages long.
</li><li> <em>The Life and Opinions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TristramShandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TristramShandy">Tristram Shandy</a>, Gentleman</em> could be seen as this when the title character narrator digresses so much that his birth is not even covered until volume 3 of this 9 volume book, but the entire story is a humorous series of anecdotes and digressions.
</li><li> In the three-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">Doorstopper</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, most of the first chapter is a cosy birthday party, the second chapter is full of exposition about the main plot of the book and it only gets going the next chapter with the protagonist leaving home. Even then, it takes about half of the volume <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> for the whole Fellowship to meet, form up and begin the main Quest of the Ring. And that's not including the Introduction to get new readers up to speed on the events of its much shorter predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> is front-loaded with exposition, despite only being published as one book. Much of this is aimed at literally building the world of Middle-earth, but several chapters are devoted to the origins of minor figures. In this "History of the Silmarils," it's not until midway through the fifth chapter that the eventual creator of the Silmarils is even introduced.
</li><li> A common phrase said by fans to new readers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em>. The first book throws the reader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">in the deep end</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes">without so much as a "can you swim?"</a>, with a whole host of characters and events and expects you to run with it. After the first few hundred pages, after the reader has acclimatised themselves, the experience quickly becomes less "Huh-wha?" and more "Ooohh! That's clever." Additionally, the first novel is considered the least well-written of the ten books in the series and is much slower going than the action and plot packed second book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates">Deadhouse Gates</a></em>. Some reasons for that are that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon">Gardens of the Moon</a></em> was written almost a decade before its follow-up, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadhouseGates">Deadhouse Gates</a></em>, and was originally written as a film script before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenErikson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenErikson">Steven Erikson</a> decided to turn it into a book.
</li><li> <em>The Marriage Plot</em> by Jeffrey Eugenides features detailed descriptions of the protagonist, Madeleine's English literature courses at Brown University, including a lengthy discussion of Semiotics that's either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a> or thinly veiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>. There are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">info dumps</a> on manic depression and religious studies used to flesh out her putative suitors, Leonard and Mitchell, along with several chapters where Mitchell travels through Europe and India. Considering that the story's a relatively simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, many readers find it a bit much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams">Tad Williams</a> loves to take his time. His <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> trilogy (the fourth book was so long it had to be cut into two 800-page books for the paperbacks) took 150 pages for the action to start; everything up to that was mystery, backbiting, and intrigue. The entire first book of his Shadowmarch series is intro. The central mystery of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Otherland">Otherland</a></em> series is introduced in the opening chapters of the first book and barely even merits mentioning until it's wrapped up at the end of the fourth doorstopper. The only book he's written that got things going in a short amount of time also wrapped up quickly, that being his stand-alone novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong">Tailchaser's Song</a></em>.
</li><li> Klaus Mann's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mephisto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mephisto">Mephisto</a></em> can be neatly divided into two halves: a detailed history of theater in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarGermany">Weimar Germany</a>, followed by the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">collaborating with the Nazis to advance his career</a>. The film adaptation notably pares down the former story to focus on the latter.
</li><li> Jeffrey Eugenides' earlier novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Middlesex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Middlesex">Middlesex</a></em>, also suffers from this at times, covering as it does a large swath of history from the Greco-Turkish War of the 1920s to Detroit during the Depression, the birth of the Black Power movement and the Detroit riots of 1967... all before the protagonist takes center stage.
</li><li> The first hundred pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose">The Name of the Rose</a></em> go at a mindbogglingly easygoing and unhurried pace (at least compared to other murder mystery novels), with <em>lots</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">obscure references and other diversions unconnected to any part of the whodunnit itself</a>. Its author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco">Umberto Eco</a> wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> postscript in part to clarify that the hard-to-get-into beginning was a deliberate choice.
<div class="indent"><strong>Eco:</strong> Those first hundred pages are like a penance or initiation, and if someone does not like them, so much the worse for him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">He can stay at the foot of the mountain.</a>
</div></li><li> Parodied in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>; the fictional novel that it "abridges" supposedly has a second chapter involving sixty-six pages of Florinese history. This chapter is left out completely. There's also the referenced scene where the abridging author (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman">William Goldman</a>) describes how a visiting princess arrives, unpacks in meticulous detail, is insulted at dinner, and then <em>repacks</em> everything in just as much detail as she unpacked, before leaving and never being seen again. Indeed, the whole premise of the book is that Goldman published the "good parts version" because the original was so very long and tedious.
</li><li> <em>The Princess of Cleves</em>, a 17th-century French novel, begins with about 40 pages describing King Henri II's court and family in confusing and mind-numbing detail. But most of this is irrelevant to the real story, a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> involving three of the aristocrats.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWChambers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertWChambers">Robert W. Chambers</a> story <em>The Repairer of Reputations</em> starts with 2-3 pages of alternate history. If you completely skip it, you won't even notice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReturnOfTheNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheReturnOfTheNative">The Return of the Native</a></em> spends all of the first chapter describing the heath where the story takes place. The whole goddamn chapter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> spends quite a while showing the reader why Louis Wu wants to go traveling. Unfortunately, the reason he wants to travel is that his life is boring and hollow, something that Niven gets across a bit too effectively.
</li><li> The opening chapter of Nathaniel Hawthorne's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></em>, called "The Custom House," is composed of between 31 and 55 pages of exposition based on which version you're reading. What does this lengthy opening have to do with the book? Nothing. It tells of how a fictional Hawthorne found the fictional documents to write The Scarlet Letter. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">a thematic device</a> that most people just skip over, as it's extremely dry. It's basically a long list of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">digs</a> at Hawthorne's former co-workers, along with his complaints about being fired when <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system">his party lost the election.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Some parts, in particular the description of the General, may have had some satirical value for contemporary readers. For modern readers? Not so much.
</li><li> The first third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries">The Skylark of Space</a></em> is rather low-key. All the action occurs on Earth and is mostly the subterfuge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">DuQuesne</a> trying to steal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Seaton's</a> technology. Then they finally do get in space, and after a few jaunts to various planets, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> eventually comes in full force.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">So Long And Thanks For All The Fish</a> has a chapter in the middle which is basically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a></em> giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech">"Reason You Suck" Speech</a> to all the fans asking about Arthur's sex life, then tells readers who <em>aren't</em> interested in it to skip ahead to the last chapter, which is rather good and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Marvin</a> in it.
</li><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">King's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> were really about a battle between good and evil, it would consist 90% of exposition and set-up. Of course, it just ends up being about a pandemic and the rebuilding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> with a bonus dash of that good vs. evil thing. Typically of King's style, the ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">features an epilogue longer than the final confrontation itself</a> about someone making his way home by various mundane means while nothing much happens. (The book was heavily influenced by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, which has a similarly long denouement.)
</li><li> Arthur Ransome's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwallowsAndAmazons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwallowsAndAmazons">Swallows and Amazons</a></em> series is full of this (except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea</span>) to the point where, in a hypothetical 100-chapter book, chapters 1-98 would be very... slowly... building up suspense, chapter 99 would be the action, and chapter 100 would be tying up loose ends. (It is especially bad in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the one where they are accused of untying boats but didn't, and it's really obvious who did it.</span>) The books <strong>are</strong> very interesting, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOfTwoCities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOfTwoCities">A Tale of Two Cities</a></em> has some difficulty with this trope: The first 6 chapters are actually very good. Interesting, full of intrigue, likable characters. Then, after finishing Part 1, (the first 6 chapters), there is Part 2 (the next 24 chapters), which is a long sluggish read setting up for part 3 (the last 15 chapters), which is very good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength">That Hideous Strength</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">drastic departure from the previous two books</a>. Firstly, it takes place on Earth, and while there are some vaguely supernatural elements introduced early on, the first 100 pages or so are, by and large, devoted to University politics and polite people politely arguing about various intellectual pursuits that seem to be nothing but fluff if you're not paying close attention (much like the CSPAN parodies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a>). You'd be forgiven for thinking you got the wrong book until the second third of the book begins and things start picking up. Of course, you get a sense for where things will be going if you can manage to pay attention.
</li><li> <em>Tyger Pool</em> by Pauline Fisk uses this deliberately to establish the slowness and gloom suffered by a recently-bereaved family, featuring long monologues by the heroine about her deceased mother and the paralysing gloom that's affected her father. Just when you think the story's not going to go anywhere... it does.
</li><li> The premise of <em>War and Democide Never Again</em> is that the heroes travel into the past to prevent all the atrocities and wars of the twentieth century. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> is actually done until halfway through the book, however. Before that, there are more than one hundred and fifty pages of the main character talking about his life before getting involved in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> to travel through time, and reading flashbacks of people's lives in oppressive dictatorships.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackLondon">Jack London</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteFang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteFang">White Fang</a></em> took about five chapters before White Fang was even <em>born,</em> let alone named.
</li><li> Don <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLillo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLillo">De Lillo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhiteNoise">White Noise</a></em> doesn't introduce the plot device "Airborne Toxic Event" until about a hundred pages in. The first segment of the book introduces characters and sets up key themes, and it's both funny and insightful, but there isn't a ton of plot there.
</li><li> This is a common problem with 18th and 19th Century novels. Because of the wide use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">Direct Line to the Author</a>, many novels start with long, irrelevant introductions about the literary agent and how he acquired the novel. (The fact that many if not most authors back then were paid by word count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">probably had something to do with it</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>: It's several chapters before we even meet the main characters. Crichton states this is because he wanted to set it all up as something of a mystery in the beginning and to uncover what's going on slowly to the reader. Which is a weird thing to do, considering the title of the book leaves little doubt as to what the reader will find inside. The huge popularity of the films makes it even worse, pushing it pretty firmly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> territory. This gets lampshaded in the scene where the cloning process is being explained; the perspective switches to Tim who notes that everyone but the scientists are clearly bored out of their minds and wishing they could just get to the dinosaurs.
</li><li> "Ayla and the Mad Scientist" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em> takes forever before we even find out who's going to be the antagonist for the book.
</li><li> Some novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> are prone to this, with the murder sometimes not even taking place until the middle of the book.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em> is one of those shows where the first two or three episodes are filled with a <em>lot</em> of exposition, and the writers hadn't gotten a good grasp on the characters' personalities or the dynamics between them yet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> - The fanbase expressed annoyance with seasons 3 and 8 because they started off on a weak note. The cluster of subplots, pacing problems, and weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> killed the tension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a> is usually known for. Around the halfway point, the writers finally got a grasp with what they should do, and managed to produce much stronger episodes until the end of their respective seasons.
</li><li> <em>Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> started things off with many episodes with disconnected plot points that failed to grab audiences. Many of the plot points introduced in these episodes become relevant in later episodes and the series really starts hitting its stride when the plot focuses more on Centipede, introduced in the first episode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, The mysterious Clairvoyant, is introduced. Events in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> had dramatic effects on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>. It's entirely possible that there was padding added to the first season while waiting for the film's release. The most common advice seasoned fans give to newcomers is to hang in there past the first dozen episodes.
</li><li> Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> starts off pretty slow as it spends most of the first few episodes setting up key plot points that pay off at the end and mostly puts jokes to the side. The whole season should be thought of like a movie with interweaving plots that make much more sense as the story goes on.
</li><li> The producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> have openly laughed that "you look at the first few episodes and it feels like a totally different show." Indeed, Oliver working on his own was handled in a rough way and the island flashbacks were seen as a major distraction and time-waster. It was the addition of supporting characters Diggle and Felicity that began to spark the show up and then the flashbacks becoming just as important to the overall arc that made the show a hit.
</li><li> Many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> lament of how hard it is to get new people into the show. This is because much of the first season is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">very difficult to get through</a>, being largely episodic and universe-building in nature, to pave the way for later events. And featuring a bland and uninteresting male lead who was replaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">in the second season</a>.
</li><li> The first 12 episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> (or its first season) had potential and could be fun/entertaining, but had no continuous plot and relied on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> episodes, as well as having some cringy humour thrown in and clunky, predictable villains. Trust us that it is totally worth sticking with it for season 2 and 3, which are both full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Awesome Moments</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">Funny Moments</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments">Heartwarming Moments</a>, and the odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.
</li><li> The story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed">Cursed</a></em> moves very slowly in the first half of Season 1; after the first episode the plot mostly consists of Nimue running/hiding from the Paladins and Merlin's extended quest to steal Fey Fire, with it taking ages for anything significant to happen. However, the pace picks up after the fifth episode, with things getting a lot more exciting after Nimue begins leading the Fey resistance and it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merlin is Nimue's real father</span>, among other things.
</li><li> For this reason, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em> once introduced a story under the title "Be Patient, This Gets Amazing."
</li><li> Series 8 of modern <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> is the first season for the Twelfth Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>) and is a hit-and-miss year. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> is preoccupied with giving belated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> to companion Clara Oswald (who'd spent her first half-season as more of a walking plot device than as a person), leading to some spotlight-hogging and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> with Danny Pink. Twelve's a broody, dry-witted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> who takes longer to warm up to than most Doctors. And the arc culminates in a gloomy finale that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> for both Clara and the Doctor. But the season manages some fan favorites in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E4Listen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E4Listen">Listen</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E8MummyOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E8MummyOnTheOrientExpress">Mummy on the Orient Express</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline">Flatline</a>", and it's directly out of this arc that a strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> and an excellent Series 9 emerge. A warmer Doctor takes center stage in better-paced stories that have a good balance of action and introspection, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> that puts him through an emotional wringer yet ends on a hopeful note twice over (first with a finale that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has him separated from Clara for good</span>, second with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brings closure to his relationship with River Song</span>).
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo">Fargo</a></em> was initially met with criticism due to being much slower than the previous two, lacking the clear focus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain">instantly memorable villains</a>, and much of the violence and criminal drama that drove the show prior. After the halfway point brings the scattered storylines and characters together, it ramps up considerably with tons of the show's trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>, bloodshed, and surreal imagery (the addition of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the long-absent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Mr. Wrench</a></span> to the cast certainly helped). The season is still divisive, but much more well-liked than at the beginning — with "Who Rules the Land of Denial?" being seen as one of the series' best episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> had a tough time building an audience during its first season, because its earlier episodes resembled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> a little too much, what with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> plots, and its FBI based setting to solve paranormal crimes and/or mysteries. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a> helming the show during its early days may have hurt as well (if the reputations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> were anything to go by). As a result, sci-fi fans tuned out before the halfway mark, which was the point when <em>Fringe</em> revealed that those episodes were mere setup for the <em>real</em> plot that has unfolded ever since. At that point, <em>Fringe</em> carved its own identity beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">X-Files-meets-Lost</a> that stereotyped the show earlier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">and never lost its stride from that point onward</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> season one can be aptly described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue">Prolonged Prologue</a> in TV form. Most of what goes on establish the many protagonists and significant locales that will be heavily involved later in the plot. With the exception of some key moments, most of what unfolds is exposition layered on top of more exposition, with not much plot inertia going on (similar to how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> started; see below). This all changes once the big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> hits in episode nine, which throws the semi-stable equilibrium of the previous episodes into outright chaos, which defines the following episodes, and never relents from that point onward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em> suffers from a lot of pacing problems early on such as stretching the Danny Rand proving his identity plot over several episodes. Once episode six comes along, the pace picks up somewhat, however, it's still largely seen as the slowest of the Netflix shows. This wound up hurting the show's critical reception considerably as the critics only had access to the first six episodes when writing their reviews, resulting in it becoming the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes">"Rotten"</a> property in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">MCU</a>.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> season 3 opened up with an awe-inspiring first five minutes, many fans found the first six episodes to be very frustrating and boring, plus a hasty death that cut off a potentially awesome future to an already great character. Some viewers during the season's original airing jumped ship around this time, which is too bad because the following episodes were mostly wonderful, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">completely unexpected season ending</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">changed everything viewers knew about the show</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8">Sense8</a></em> has a lot of work setting up eight distinct stories but it's pretty universally agreed that no one can make it through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "What's Up?" in episode 4</span> and not be thoroughly hooked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> isn't terrible <em>per se</em> but the first couple of seasons struggle, with awkward storylines, jerky character development and interaction, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">often heavy-handed morals</a> that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">don't get away with as easily as the original series</a> did. By the third season however, they've really come into their own and distinguished themselves as more than just a sequel series for a cult '60s show. Next Gen is now one of the most popular series and is in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> had similar early growing pains. The writers were riding Next Gen's coat-tails <em>hard</em> early on, with a lot of first-season episodes that had a big "hey, remember this thing from <em>The Next Generation</em>?" hook. It eventually found its feet and had its own story to tell, and did as much to deepen the Trek universe as any other series broadened it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>'s first two episodes, despite their very obvious attempt at being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a>, is seen as this, as many viewers and critics felt they were a somewhat lacking introduction to the series, and that they especially fell short when it came to presenting the central premise of the show, due to their massive focus on the character Michael, when the show is overall much more ensemble-based that the two episodes in question claims.
</li></ul></li><li> A common complaint about the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective">True Detective</a></em> is how slow the show is at the beginning, specifically because there are very few dramatic elements involved. The first couple of episodes more or less just revolve around Hart and Cohle discussing clues about the case and interviewing suspects, like a rather slow-paced police procedural. The general consensus is that the show finally begins to pick up steam around Episode 3, and by the halfway point in Episode 4, the show really starts getting interesting. <em>Especially</em> after seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOner">The Oner</a> at the end of Episode 4.
</li><li> The first five episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em> are very slow, due to hardly any characters actually being aware of the vampires' existence. Then Elena finds out at the end of episode five, and the show improves considerably.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> isn't exactly instant gratification TV, and it certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">does not exactly make it easy for new viewers to jump in and understand the show</a>. The first few episodes get hit with this problem the hardest, which almost overwhelms to the point of discouragement, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">detail overload</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">abundance of characters to introduce and dissect</a>. However, as all longtime fans of <em>The Wire</em> know <em>very</em> well, for people willing to take the time to understand the show's intricate design, they will be rewarded a hundred times over. It just takes some perseverance to get there.

</li><li> "Octavarium", is even worse, as it begins with an overlong Continuum Fingerboard solo... and it's not much better from there on, as it takes <em>12 minutes</em> for anything even remotely metal to happen.

</li><li> Kris Kristofferson's 1970 debut album <em>Kristofferson</em> features his own versions of all his early songs that revolutionized country music songwriting ("Me and Bobby McGee", "Help Me Make It Through The Night" and "Sunday Morning Comin' Down" for starters), but for some odd reason the album opens with the goofy, sarcastic, not-very-country novelty song "Blame It on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Stones"</a>.
</li><li> It is commonly said that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a> music is Rossini's William Tell Overture". Those interested in "hearing the original" may fall victim to this trope. The William Tell overture actually has four movements and the Lone Ranger music is the last one.

Probably the most tedious is the beginning of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a 20-minute-plus suite which takes several minutes of atmospheric instrumental music before the drums even enter, let alone the vocals. "Echoes" is another notable offender, being almost as long and having another slow beginning section.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackKeys">The Black Keys</a> were known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth">straighforward rock</a>.

These intros/outros are usually removed for an artist's album and their appearance phases in and out of use based on current trends: as of 2012, many producers are reducing or removing their beat intros altogether.

</li><li> Wrestlers are generally taught to avoid this, which is why the chain wrestling portions of a match (headlocks, wristlocks, hammerlocks, etc.) tend not to last too long. Unless the workers are exceptionally good at mat grappling - wherein they'll be able to make a slow pace still very fun to watch.
</li><li> This is why the opening match is considered one of the most important ones on the card. Cruiserweights and other flashy wrestlers are usually given the job of opening the show - as high intensity and fast-paced matches function to get the crowd really excited. If a slow-paced or boring match opens the show, it almost always results in a disinterested crowd for the rest of the night. That said, when a show is being broadcast the first match <em>filmed</em> is considered the opener, while the very first match of the night will often be uneventful, mainly to give extra time to any fans running late, because empty seats don't look good on camera. This also gives fans already there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">more time at the merchandise tables</a>, as they know they won't be missing anything they paid to see.

The low power can also make even well-conceived adventures seem unexceptional, with character facing wimpy monsters for low stakes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAllianceAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAllianceAlive">The Alliance Alive</a></em> starts off as a very linear RPG for the first 10 hours.

Coming off the crashed blimp, you have barely any money to buy your starting equipment, and your skills are lacking. It's hard to say at what point the game manages to pick-up, but you'll just suddenly realize that it did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI">Assassin's Creed I</a></em> takes a good hour and a half to get to your first real mission. That's if you're quick.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> spends the first three sequences setting up the plot with a completely different character and doesn't really open up until the 6th sequence about seven to ten hours in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first game is extremely unforgiving to begin with, as you are at level one (see the D&amp;D entry above) and have barely any HP, combat ability (whether you are a fighter, mage or other class) or special abilities (where applicable). You can only really start to actually do anything interesting without being slaughtered after gaining a couple of levels, half-decent equipment, and a party.
</li><li> <em>Baldur's Gate II</em> has a much more forgiving opening area. For a start, there's the fact that being a direct successor means you actually have some skills and are tougher than a wounded puppy this time around (and you can actually import your character from the first game). However, the opening dungeon becomes extremely obnoxious and boring for many after the first trip or two through it, let alone if you like making new character builds. Mods have been made that allow you to skip it entirely while still taking everything of note, including experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a></em> has a similar start. Thankfully, there are some moderately challenging sidequests in the first town to get experience. Going on to fight the first goblins will probably get you killed, especially your squishy wizard, with his 4 hitpoints and one spell (two if you have maxed Intelligence).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em> has an opening act that takes at minimum a half hour to complete before you can enter the first level, Mayahem Temple, due to the prolonged length of the cutscenes if you don't skip them. Compare this to the original game, where you could get into Mumbo's Mountain less than five minutes after starting a new game.

The Bard himself can choose to shut him up before he finishes, but doing this denies the Bard a useful trinket a little later on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitos">Baten Kaitos</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</em> gets off to a rocky start. The card-based battle system is something that you really have to experiment with to master; even if you read the manual cover to cover, you'll still spend the first few battles just pushing buttons. Just to add to that, you spend most of Sadal Suud with nobody but Kalas in your party, which slows battles against even the weakest enemies to a crawl. Finally, to top the whole thing off, there's little to no strategy involved; most of your weapons are simple nonelemental swords with only one spirit number, reducing battles to little more than hitting the enemies over and over. It's probably intended to ease players into the system, but it makes the whole thing feel clunky and tedious.
</li><li> <em>Origins</em>, meanwhile, suffers from an underwhelming first half. The gameplay is enjoyable, but, story-wise, all the major villains can't die yet, so you lose a lot of boss battles. <em>A lot</em>. Sagi becomes a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero">Failure Hero</a> just because he's so ineffective at getting things done. It's not until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Heart-to-Heart scene</a> that Sagi becomes anything more than a thorn in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s side.

In a fighting game where rounds of actual gameplay typically last less than two minutes. Fortunately, it's completely optional, and the dialogue for skipping it even has one character comment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">nobody's there to listen to that much talking</a>.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodRayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodRayne">BloodRayne</a></em> game began with several levels in an ugly brown swampy area, fighting zombies and <em>spiders</em>. It's only after you slog through this that you get to the real business of slaughtering Nazis. Thankfully in subsequent playthroughs, you can skip the swamps entirely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelyDefault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelyDefault">Bravely Default</a></em> starts you off with only two characters, both of the Freelancer class, meaning that all combat consists of attacking enemies. This admittedly does do a good job of introducing the player to the Brave and Default mechanics (you can "Brave" to take multiple actions in one turn at the cost of skipping some turns afterwards, or "Default" to reduce damage taken and reduce the aforementioned turn penalty), but is mindlessly boring if you already understand it. Then you beat your first bosses and get the first job Asterisks: Monk (good at attacking, the same thing you were doing before), and White Mage (can heal, also something the Freelancer could do). Contrast this to the endgame, where you have several unique jobs with varied and interesting skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64">Castlevania 64</a></em> begins with the forest complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew">Camera Screw</a> nasty platforms, moves on to the Villa with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze">hedge maze</a>, then puts you smack dab in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">the nitro level</a>. Once you get past that the game actually gets pretty fun, but most people unfortunately don't stay that long and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">its rather bad reputation stuck</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> can make a bad first impression, thrusting you into the plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> with underwhelming weapons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics">Jump Physics</a> that even the game's fans admit are very floaty, and tiresome fetch quests. Things pick up when you get to the Sand Zone, where "fetch quest" means "go explore this big open level with varied interesting enemies at your own pace". By the time you reach the Labyrinth, you're done with the fetch quests, you have some excellent weapons, and you're finally starting to get a bearing on the plot.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> games (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">member in spirit</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em>) start off quite slow: you have only one city, it takes ages for anything to get done, and there's miles and miles of empty space between you and the next civilization/faction over (usually). However, the game gets increasingly engrossing (and time-consuming) as world civilization gets more and more complex, and your rivals develop a unique character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em> suffers from this. The game opens with a roughly six-minute cutscene about the release of the Dark Genie; unfortunately, about four of those minutes are spent on long, slow shots of characters dancing. Once the Genie is released, it looks like things will pick up...but then we cut to Toan's village, and there's <em>another</em> six-minute cutscene detailing the festival that he's supposed to attend (which again features long, slow shots of characters dancing). Things don't even pick up after the Dark Genie's attack, as this leads to yet another cutscene, followed by further bouts of exposition from the Mayor as he gives you the key to the first dungeon. All told, it takes about thirty minutes for you to actually start fighting monsters and restoring your village. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud2">Dark Cloud 2</a></em> goes even further with this, as it opens with an extended sequence of main character Max...going to a circus. The player mostly watches cutscenes—including a lengthy sequence of circus acts that has no bearing on the plot—and only gets to control Max for a few minutes as he chases around a small boy who stole his circus tickets. What makes this particularly frustrating is that there's a sequence that could have been a lot of fun to play—namely, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilClown">Evil Clown</a> Flotsam and his goons are chasing Max through the city—but this, too, is an FMV.
</li><li> Unfortunately, the first couple of hours <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition">Deadly Premonition</a></em> are probably its weakest. After the opening cutscene, the player is thrown headfirst into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>-inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> combat section, which features both quite clunky controls and enemy behavior, and very simple, yet tedious puzzles. Immediately after this follows a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">exposition-heavy</a> cutscenes, broken up by some short gameplay sections where all the player is tasked with is walking from one place to the next. It's not until the first few objectives are done with, that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>-esque town of Greenvale opens up, marking the point where the game REALLY gets interesting.
</li><li> The first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> was this for many people; it essentially throws you to the wolves and is extremely difficult if you don't yet get how the overall gameplay and systems of the game work yet. On the other hand, it grows on many people in subsequent playthroughs for this reason too (as it doesn't really compromise too much on what works so well in the game). It's also thematically appropriate, as several characters note that the mission <em>is</em> a test of JC's capabilities, and if you complete it at all most people will be deeply impressed and say things like, "Who's awesome? You're awesome."
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> game started by forcing you to jump around the lifeless opening foyer of a mansion and find 45 red orbs to unlock a door before meeting your first mook. And if you die enough times to try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode">Mercy Mode</a>, you have to do the first few levels again. Thankfully, the games that followed did not do this, recognizing what the majority of players bought the game for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> games often start off slow-paced and tedious at first, as the game has to provide story exposition and take you through a series of tutorial stages to explain numerous game mechanics. Once you unlock the Item World, you've probably got a basic handle on how the game works and you get to finally have a good place to grind your characters and your <em>items</em> to ungodly levels while having fun doing so. In other words, the game goes from "I don't get the appeal of this..." to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel">Just One More Grinding Run</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity">Divine Divinity</a></em> is a perfect example of this. Long, linear dungeon crawl to begin with, takes at least several hours to get through before you get to the heavily nonlinear and somewhat less combat-intensive main part of the game, which has heaps of interesting quests and whatnot. Technically it's possible to skip the dungeon but it makes it difficult somewhat because every other enemy around is well too tough at level 1.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> <em>The Final Gathering</em> consists of five levels, the first three of which are pretty amateurish and usually considered to be terrible. The latter two, however, are surprisingly good, to the point of earning the mod a place in Doomworld's "top 100 WADs of all time" list back in 2004.
</li><li> One of the things people hated about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em> was the incredibly drawn-out opening where your marine arrives at the Mars base, signs in, meets a few people, observes some stuff, gets assigned a mission to find a missing scientist by his sergeant, gets issued with a standard-issue pistol by the quartermaster, goes looking for the scientist, and it's only when you finally find him that the hellgate blows open and demonic forces rip through the base, turning 90% of the staff (including the scientist you were looking for) into zombies, unleashing the legions of hell on the rest, and <em>finally</em> giving you something to shoot. Considering this was supposed to be <em>DOOM</em> aka. "the quintessential non-stop demon murderpalooza series", some people were left feeling a bit betrayed that the series had apparently decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">take cues from</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, from a strictly storytelling standpoint, went through this. Act 1 is relatively slow, acting in a similar manner to the above-mentioned first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: Those first fifteen hours or so do nothing but expand on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">the first game</a>'s world-building, introduce plot elements, and set up future events (mostly having to do with the Qunari and Templar/Mage conflict). The entire thing is more or less one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocuouslyImportantEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocuouslyImportantEpisode">Innocuously Important Episode</a>. Act 2 is where the game begins taking many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">the plot points and items introduced in Act 1</a> and starts weaving them into the overall narrative.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> has an exciting prologue setting up the initial mystery, interesting recruitment missions as you gather your party... and then most of Act 1 is spent grinding the most generic quests in the game through the least interesting areas of the game for hours until you can unlock one of two alliance missions. Then the actual plot kicks in, and after a few linear story missions, the map opens up and the actual meat of the game starts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">Dragon Quest VII</a></em> may have the longest Start-to-Slime time in video game history.
<ul><li> The game sets itself up nicely in the beginning for the time-travel/world-hopping main storyline, but it takes <em>two freakin' hours</em> before the party encounters its first monster.
</li><li> The reaction your hero's friends have to this first battle may be a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">Kiefer's</a> so excited he breaks into <em>insane laughter</em>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Maribel</a> is... less than pleased.
</li><li> The game also starts to get real fun when you reach Dhama Temple and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem">Job System</a> kicks in, which is about 30 hours later. Before that the fights are still pretty boring.
</li></ul></li><li> For people used to modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGames">Role-Playing Games</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> games can be this. The only way to know how far your character is from the next level is to head to the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint">Save Point</a>, combat is <em>brutal</em> on lower levels, and depending on the game, there may be few ways to regenerate magic outside of towns. Even the newer games like <em>IX</em> suffer from these due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a>.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestMonsters">Dragon Quest Monsters</a></em> on the Game Boy Color, while superior to its spawn in almost every other way, suffers from a lot of dull text at the start, as you're forced to wander around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">Noob Cave</a> with monsters that don't have much in the way of usable skills, then do another mediocre dungeon, before you can finally start using the customization that makes the game so awesome. The DS game suffers a little from this, but the period is much shorter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> sort of fits this, though in an odd way. It would be more accurate to say the player gets better. Simply, Dwarf Fortress is so complex that anyone new to the game simply will be unable to enjoy it yet. But once you figure out how to dig and build, you'll start enjoying the game. Then you can begin to scale that difficulty cliff, which provides you with an ever increasing view of awesome that by the time you reach the top you feel you deserve every bit of fun you now get... until you realize you just climbed up the side of a volcano, and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother">Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> starts you out with one party member, rendering any strategy beyond 'hit and get hit' nonexistent. Also, the game gives you little room for error; this isn't too much of a problem in Onett, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Peaceful Rest Valley</a> can be a nightmare even with the help of the rolling HP meter. After Paula joins and levels up enough for her tremendous speed and magical powers to start showing, the game gets much better. And before that... well, let's just let <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ZeroPunctuation">Yahtzee</a> explain it:
<div class="indent">The first thing you have to do is walk to the top of a hill, look around, then walk all the way down and go back to bed. The second thing you do is exactly the same thing, only now fighting the shittiest monsters the union had to offer. Thats not a slow boil; thats chucking a signal flare into a swimming pool.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> will be rather tedious at times, especially since this is the only game of the series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter">Random Encounters</a>. But as soon as you first enter Magicant, the game gets a little better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em> does this as well. The first three chapters cover three very important days. While they may be excellent as far as the story goes, the gameplay suffers somewhat, <em>especially</em> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding">Chapter 3</a>. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, however, you get control of Lucas and Boney, and the gameplay becomes much more enjoyable, especially after getting your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The intros to both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">Arena</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> include relatively boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">tutorial dungeons</a> from which the player must escape before they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningTheSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningTheSandbox">free to explore the sandbox</a>. <em>Daggerfall</em> also has a lengthy sequence to generate your character and choose/create your class. Much of the latter part can be skipped, in which case the game randomizes the options. This is, however, not recommended, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameDelegationPenalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameDelegationPenalty">the randomized options can range from inconvenient to outright crippling</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Morrowind</em> likewise has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial">Forced Tutorial</a> sequence during the intro, but is thankfully short compared to the other games in the series. It consists of leaving the prison ship (learning the controls), talking to a guard captain (choose your race and sex), filling out your paperwork (choose your class and birth sign), and picking up a few items (learning the menus). It can be done it about 5 minutes, but that hasn't stopped the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> which allow it to be skipped.
</li><li> On the other hand, some fans have complained that it is <em>too short</em>, and doesn't give the player enough information to easily survive in the game world. That <em>Morrowind</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a> environment to begin with lends some veracity to these arguments.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>'s tutorial level has generated a considerable amount of dislike. It consists of a (dull) cave which you must play through before you can start the game proper. Considering one of the biggest selling points for the game is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">beautiful outdoor landscapes</a>, it is seen as particularly stupid to set the tutorial entirely inside a stuffy dungeon. AS with <em>Morrowind</em>, there are plentiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> available which change the tutorial and character generation processes. Naturally, they're some of the more popular mods available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Skyrim</em> manages to briefly show off the main attractions—impressive landscapes and dragons—during the introduction. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Dragonborn</a> gets hauled across the landscape, then sent to the executioner's block, then rescued by a dragon... and after that the tutorial starts. Which is mostly an underground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawler">Dungeon Crawl</a>, yet again. In short, it takes a while to get to the sandbox mode. It gets tedious to go through again when one wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis">start a new game with a different character</a>.
</li><li> Also in <em>Skyrim</em>, while the player gets free rein to explore after the tutorial dungeon, if you want to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Shouts</a> you still have some tedium ahead of you. You need to go from Riverwood, to Whiterun, to a dungeon near Riverwood (Although you can clear the dungeon before heading to Whiterun, since you can get a sidequest from the merchant in Riverwood that'll take you through it), back to Whiterun, then go kill your first dragon, then report back to the Jarl and get told to go see the Greybeards. You're looking at a good 2-3 hours to access Shouts, and that's if you don't get distracted by something more interesting along the way.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin">The Evil Within</a></em> has a tense and frightening first chapter that immediately goes into a lull with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th chapters. Chapter 5 ramps up the creepiness and terror, and Chapter 6 plunges you right into the emotionally tense and nerve-wracking atmosphere of the rest of the game headfirst. The chapters also grow to be far longer, with Chapter 3 taking about 30 minutes to complete, and Chapter 6 taking anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion">Eversion</a></em> seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Sugar Bowl</a> Mario-clone platformer at first, but after a few levels, you need to figure out how to "evert" in order to solve the puzzles. Then the game's major narrative elements start to kick in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FairyFencerF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FairyFencerF">Fairy Fencer F</a></em> starts out dreadfully dull, with a half-hour-long cutscene featuring a deliberately unlikeable protagonist and his new partner who sounds whiny by sheer dint of having to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker">The Slacker</a> broken up by only two heavily-scripted battle tutorials. It picks up quickly once the interminable cutscenes end and the first dungeon gives the player both some freedom and a taste of the game's humor. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Advent Dark Force</a></em> does what it can to fix this, spreading a similar cutscene out across a brand-new introductory dungeon, but it still has to cover the same points and the dungeon itself is a slog thanks to the dull prison design and only having one enemy type. (Both games also suffer from a deluge of often-redundant tutorial slides, but these are delivered in-character by Eryn, who annoys the other characters doing the same thing in speech.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> takes at least a half-hour to get going, as you're forced through an extended character creation/exposition bit that, for all its attempted immersion, even <em>one of the characters</em> admits is a joke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">right before he offers to change your stats for you</span>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, by contrast, has an extremely quick tutorial. However, the first hours of the game are defined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a>, mostly by throwing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gates</a> up everywhere, funneling players who don't know how to get around them more or less down the same route. Once you actually get to New Vegas and its surrounding areas, the game massively opens up, the main quest picks up, and the entire thing generally gets a lot more enjoyable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, you begin with little money and poor equipment, and typically fight repetitive melee battles against scorpions. The more interesting gun battles against gun-wielding soldiers and powerful mutants of the wastelands start coming in The Den, and get more interesting as the game goes on. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, the very first thing you do in the game is travel through the Temple of Trials, a tutorial that makes absolutely no sense and even <em>contradicts the main story</em> in having this incredibly elaborate temple only used for worthiness-testing next to your dirt-poor village. Then the trial features a scrap against another member of your tribe to prove your worthiness - using your fists. Difficult if you've specced for guns during setup or worse gone for certain diplomacy traits, unless you use an oddball way around it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> opens with a very long intro, then a tutorial battle comprising schoolyard children having a snowball fight, then more exposition before finally getting to the game.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> suffers too. During the first battle, only Ramza is controllable, and there's 10 other AI controlled units, so you'd have to wait and watch until your turn comes up. Plus, the first chapter of the game is pretty slow-paced. (But it's so hard that you probably won't even notice.)
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> gives you the meat of the core gameplay off the bat, it'll take you anywhere between 6 to 8 hours on your first try. Then Sephiroth shows up and becomes the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains">killing President Shinra</a>, with AVALANCHE escaping from Shinra HQ and Midgar afterward, gaining access to the overworld. And to put it into perspective just how long of a game this is, the entire prologue doesn't even take up <strong>one third</strong> of the time it takes to complete the games first disc (of three)!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>: While a whole lot definitely happens, and you are thrown into battles almost immediately, the player does not reach an area with real random encounters and exploration until Kilika Woods, several hours into the game. And once you finish the woods, its another few hours of cutscenes and linear story events until you reach the next area with random battles, the Mi'ihen Highroad.
</li><li> The first twenty levels of your first character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> are <em>painful</em>, as the game drops you in your hometown with absolutely no instruction about how to do anything. They're by far the hardest, most frustrating, most unintuitive, grindtastic levels you will ever play in the entire game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. It's 2-3 hours before you get any real combat options.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> dumps you straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInMediasRes">a plot-in-progress</a> with no real clue as to what's going on, who these characters are, and what they're trying to do. On the subject of characters, most of them don't make a good first impression, so you're likely to spend a while hating at least one or two of them. Gameplay-wise, the crystarium and paradigm systems are completely absent, leaving you with nothing to do but use the Auto-Battle command every turn, and maybe an item here or there to mix it up a bit. It's not until the Anima fight that the gameplay gets interesting. On the bright side, it's all uphill from there.
</li><li> Many consider the entirety of the <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, the base game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> to be extremely slow paced. The majority of quests are either a series of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> too many, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a>. The story itself drags out and you have to do a <em>lot</em> of quests before things get interesting. The post-patch content for <em>A Realm Reborn</em> is a little better, but the game doesn't get better about it until last handful of quests where things go to hell real fast and the lead up into the <em>Heavenward</em> story. The developers did finally address the issue and made the base game more bearable for new players by removing several quests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> seems like it will avert this, only for it to double down on this trope by having most of the first half be slow paced. It starts off with a random sequence of the final battle for no particular reason (the story isn't told in flashback) before cutting back to the group bidding Noctis' dad and town goodbye before... pushing your car forward for a bit. It then proceeds to plod its way through a very uneventful first several hours where you have to fix the car, save some random guy and then make it to a seaside harbor. Aside from meeting the villain, nothing really happens and the sections is merely just a bunch of fetch quests. Chapter 2 picks up slightly by actually introducing the main threat of the game, but otherwise it isn't until around chapter <em>9</em> where the game finally begins to pick up steam and never stops. Various sequences during the first few chapters even take control away from you to force you to go through the main plot every so often. Exciting events like the Titan battle are few and far between and most of the time we barely get any appearances by villains other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ardyn</a> and are more often forced to sit through long sequences like the boat ride to Altissia.
</li></ul></li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlyFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlyFF">FlyFF</a></em> is a pretty big offender, most of its early advertisements and hell even its name, Fly For Fun, advertises its flying system and doing it at will, The Catch? You have to wait until level 20 to do so. Also the Class System for your character, you can't make the first change until level 15 and before you can make the change you must also complete a quest, the same happen's with the 2nd job change at level 60.
</li><li> The first level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForbiddenSiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForbiddenSiren">Forbidden Siren</a></em> was called "easily the worst level in the entire game" by one website.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomWars">Freedom Wars</a></em> starts out terribly, with you being punished for doing basic things like walking more than five steps or talking to people, as well as a bunch of walking back and forth for a later mission. But once you get fast travel, the game becomes far less dull due to most of the padding being removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GabrielKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GabrielKnight">Gabriel Knight</a></em> suffers from this for those not interested in backstory, historical minutiae, and/or drawn-out interview processes, especially when controlling Grace. Each of the three games takes about half the game for the action to pick up, which is good when it does, but until then it's jarring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em> starts out feeling like a rehash of the first game, up until about a quarter of the way through, when you get the ship. Even if you know exactly where to go and what to do, many players will feel like they are trudging through nothing but mundane fetch quests and crossing one side of a continent to another for the plot while wading though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> up the ass. It isn't until after discovering the true nature of the Lighthouses in Lumeria and then going to the far west to tackle the Jupiter Lighthouse is when the game starts to pick up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> threw many people off guard in 1998 when everyone expected shooters to be like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>. Instead players have to sit through a few minutes of Gordon Freeman riding the tram, then navigating his maze-like workplace, grabbing his suit, starting the Resonance Cascade, and go through a few more hallway before Gordon even picks up a gun.
<ul><li> While the prologue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> is well liked, the first "real" gameplay sequence in the canals/Airboat before getting a weapon on the airboat, and then the gravity gun after that, is considered a drudge by a lot of people. Note as well that the real gameplay starts in chapter 3; the first two chapters before that, other than one chase sequence in which you have no weapons, consist entirely of unskippable dialogue and world-building. When selecting "New Game", you can choose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">begin on any chapter you've already played to</a>, allowing you to skip to Ravenholm, which is just after the Gravity Gun tutorial, and the point at which the game starts to get really good. That is also one of the two chapters playable in the demo.

It's somewhat uninteresting until Bijou joins you and the relationship between Oxnard and Pepper is fixed, and then you meet Spat, but it's when you meet Harmony that the game will hit its stride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeadOverHeels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeadOverHeels">Head Over Heels</a></em> is mostly just tricky platforming for the first sixth of the game, learning how each character works (Head's climbing and gliding abilities, Heels needing to outrun stuff and carry things around) and hunting down their gear, and not really impressing. But once they pair up in Blacktooth Market, the game <em>explodes</em> with possibilities, and only more so when the non-linear section kicks in on the Moonbase.

It starts with the player running up a long series of cut and pasted stairs, being chased by an invincible boss, proceeds into a ridiculously long and mostly pitch black forest full of enemies, all with only two characters and about as many health items. After the forest, the player gets a proper party... controlled by the AI, with the only player-controlled character being unable to attack, being required to carry another character to a nearby town. Fortunately, it picks up immediately afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Izuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Izuna">Izuna</a></em>.

The 2nd game is better for this, but still has a lot of text at the start.
</li><li> The first few levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em> are painful to get through, due to a combination of limited health and ammo, a restricted weapon selection where it takes an hour to find a weapon that even <em>tries</em> to combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">any semblance of accuracy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">actual power behind it</a>, and the stormtroopers having taken about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">sixteen levels in badass</a>. However, upon obtaining a lightsaber and gaining Force powers (and escaping the alley full of snipers that can still shoot you through the lightsaber) the game becomes primary example of how fraggin' cool it is to be a Jedi, when in almost a heartbeat you go from weeping bitter tears as you can't get through one room with <em>four</em> guys in it, to being able to literally stand in front of an entire army, not touch a single button, and <em>still win</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">killer7</a></em> has an extremely slow start, with the introductory level throwing you straight into the action without a word of explanation, and only offering bits and pieces of exposition during the incredibly long second level... but as soon as you reach the Cloudman chapter and meet Andrei Ulmeyda, the game picks up instantly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>. You go through a three hour prologue/tutorial playing as somebody who is not even the main character and whose story only even gets cursory mention throughout the rest of the game until the very end. Even within this three hours, you get five to ten minutes of really cool stuff set between a half hour of slow, boring, stuff.
</li><li> Final Mix of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> at least sort of fixes it by adding a number of things to make the whole Roxas story more relevant, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most notably a battle against him towards the end of the game.</span>
</li><li> Even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, the plot doesn't kick in until you reach Traverse Town, which happens after roughly an hour—maybe two—of play. But this is much better paced than its sequel, especially since most of the gameplay on Destiny Islands before the plot kicks into high gear is optional.
</li><li> The series has improved on this matter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> feature short and <em>skippable</em> tutorial sequences. You need to have seen the tutorial at least once in <em>Birth by Sleep</em> to be able to skip it, but you can skip <em>Dream Drop Distance</em>'s tutorials right away. <em>3D</em> even puts some of its heavier background exposition in a menu log, allowing you to view them at your leisure instead of breaking up game flow with repeated flashbacks.

It's only when planet selection is available that the games really pick up. The sequel is definitely a worse case, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">incredibly linear</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue">Prolonged Prologue</a> that takes in excess of three hours to complete, before dumping you in <em>another</em> prolonged prologue, albeit one with more openness and actual dialogue (but you still don't get a lightsaber until much later).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em> starts off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">horribly weak character</a> armed with a single clumsy weapon in a jungle full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats">irritating enemies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">unclear puzzles</a>, all while fighting tricky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics">Jump Physics</a> and trying to figure out where to go. However, this has less to do with pacing problems and more to do with the developers' stated desire to weed out anyone who doesn't have the patience to put up with the steep learning curve. It picks up after you get the grail (which makes dying very unlikely outside of boss battles) and the glyph reader (which gives you a chance to start working on most of the puzzles). By that point, you've probably got some bearing on the general logic the game runs on and have gotten the hang of the control system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant">The Last Remnant</a></em> has an <em>extremely</em> complex battle system that takes a lot of patience to understand, much less master. There's also the really long, unskippable cut scenes...but, once you understand the fights enough so that you're not just pushing buttons, it gets good. It should be noted that the PC version makes the cutscenes skippable and somewhat streamlines the battle system, though it is still quite bewildering starting out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LauraBow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LauraBow">Laura Bow</a>: The Dagger of Amon Ra</em> doesn't actually get interesting until after you make it to the museum. Before that it's a bunch of gathering information, gathering items because you've conveniently lost all of your stuff and somehow don't have a press pass, money, or a dress to wear to this party you've been hired to go to write a story on, and you have to take the taxi from place to place, watching the same unnecessarily long, unskippable transition clip every single time you do. But then the game actually starts to get interesting.

If you're expecting world-shattering events, traveling across continents in an airship (as the title might imply) or saving the world, you'll have to look elsewhere. The game's events are very grounded, and while there's great drama and battles ahead, it takes time to build that up. As in, the prologue, which spends its events in the starting town of Rolent takes about 7 hours if you're doing all the sidequests, and if you want halfway decent Quartz it's a must. The first chapter can drag in places, but once you meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Olivier</a>, the storytelling is starting to pick up. Chapter 2 has a lot of memorable scenes, and the 3rd chapter is where the plot starts to really get going. After finishing the game, it becomes apparent that all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, and exposition over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the last 40 hours</a> was there to get you invested in the cast and their world, and that it's one extended prologue to the real story in <em>SC</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">but it's worth it</a>.
</li><li> A recurring problem with the 3D installments of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em>, you have to do several successive tasks to regain your original form, from Deku Scrub to Hylian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">And you must do it within the time limit</a> or else you'll have to do everything since the beginning, because you can't save your progress until you're done. Note that the part about saving no longer applies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Majora's Mask 3D</a></em>, as owl statues now merely need to be examined instead of slashed at. Everything else is still true, however.
</li><li> The beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em> is quite different from the rest of the game: you start out on a tiny island with no weapons, hang out with a cast of pirates, are carted around on their ship, lose your equipment, have to spend about an hour doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a> (the only one in the entire game), and then have to do a number of fetch quests for various townspeople. It's only about 3 hours into the game when you finally have your equipment and your own boat that the game catches its stride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em> forces you to go through a ton of tutorial-style content before you get to the actual game. From the start of the game, it is roughly two hours before players enter the first dungeon, another hour before they gain access to Hyrule Field, and far longer still before they can explore it in its entirety. Included in the tutorials is learning how to fish, usually completely optional. Then after you catch something, you need to find out how to drop it so that the cat takes off with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em> parodies the trope. It starts out with a big chunk of back-story, told with text and still pictures, just like the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em>. Once it ends, it's shown that Link got bored and fell asleep while an old man was telling the story. As for actual gameplay, the game does its best to speed through tutorials where you can, in theory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">die</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> faces a similar problem as <em>Twilight Princess</em> by having a typical small town intro filled with various tutorials and cutscenes. While this is mitigated somewhat by a few side activities that you are free to do or skip at your discretion, it takes about an hour and a half for Link to finally journey to the Surface to properly start the adventure. And even then, it takes another hour and a half for Link to go through several <em>more</em> tutorials and cutscenes, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> where you must locate members of the local tribe, and <em>then</em> finally enter the first proper dungeon.

Instead of a long sequence of story and tutorial events, you're instead given a vertical slice of the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> right off the bat. And while you're required to complete the first four shrines to open up the rest of the game, nothing's stopping you from exploring the still-massive Great Plateau.

You also have to complete the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">inflatable Rubber Duck</a> puzzle very early. It may put of some players being stuck with lots of exposition and a hard puzzle early, when you haven't really learned the plot of the game and aren't really invested in the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>: the first game opens with a short exposition onboard the Normandy starship, followed by the "dungeon" mission on Eden Prime which serves as a combat tutorial, then more exposition, which is followed by your arrival to the game's major town, the maze-like Citadel, which is full of <em>even more exposition</em> and fetch quests with a few action scenes before finally opening up when they give you the Normandy to explore the galaxy. The sequel in contrast opens with an action-packed dungeon nowhere near as long as Eden Prime, followed by a short exposition, then another action-packed dungeon, and then an even shorter exposition before opening up. On the other hand, given that half the reason for playing BioWare games is to experience the worlds they've created, some players might <em>enjoy</em> the exposition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> can start off slow, stiff and exposition-heavy for some... until the scope of the plot and narrative slowly build up, hitting a spike at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Psycho Mantis battle</a>, culminating into an explosive, emotional climax that few games can compare to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first game starts with the derelict frigate, which is well regarded by players but then you lose everything, <em>including the Charge Beam</em>, leaving spamming the Power Beam (read: <em>constant</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing">Button Mashing</a>) your main attack until you get it back, which is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> if you're new to the series and haven't gotten used to the exploration-based gameplay.
</li><li> In <em>Echoes</em>, the start of the game is slowed down because of the extreme caution necessary during the first forays into Dark Aether. Without the Dark Suit, gameplay is reduced to darting from beacon to beacon while defeating persistent enemies, and exploration of the nonlinear worlds (the core of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>'s gameplay) is effectively <em>punished</em>. Dark Aether isn't meant to be safe by any definition, but it's only later with the obtainment of the Dark Suit that taking risks becomes a genuine option, but by then the game is already a third on the way to the end.
</li><li> In <em>Corruption</em>, the Olympus and Norion are very generic Federation areas (though the Ridley fight is good), and Bryyo is very linear and with some annoying level design and tasks. Once you beat Mogenar, you're off to Elysia, a stunning steampunk world with tramlines to grapple across, more exciting upgrades, and it gets a bit more open at this point too (a third on the way to the end).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a></em> billed itself as a game based around mind-controlling Uruks to build your own army, and you spend the entirety of act 1 doing none of that. It's actually worked into the plot, as the heroes would really like to get a start on building their army, but Shelob has stolen their Ring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> games games start out slow, but once you get used to the controls and the craft/shop system then anyone can really pick up to fighting monsters that are challenging, colorful, and entertaining, with resulting weapons follow suit. In particular, <em>Freedom Unite</em> has a set of tutorial missions that can take a day or more to get through. After you actually start getting rewarded for your effort, however, it picks up nicely, even though there's no plot beyond the premise. It goes a lot faster with friends. As part of its sweeping modernizations to the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> makes an attempt to avoid this. After a two-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a>, there's a lull as you tour your new base of operations, then just a single non-optional busywork quest before you're on to hunting the big things.
</li><li> This is one of the reasons Act I of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> tends to get flak from some players, particularly those mainly interested in the story. You travel through two quest hubs, several scripted encounters, and lots of ultimately irrelevant sidequests before you <em>finally</em> get to Neverwinter—at which point you get <em>even more</em> irrelevant sidequests before finally getting a chance to continue with the main plot.
</li><li> <em>Oh No! More <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings">Lemmings</a></em> begins with the Tame levels — twenty levels of various terrain formations, with all skills available and <em>no hazards</em>, so there is no difficulty whatever, and not much fun either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> has a long, unskippable, if beautifully drawn, introduction detailing the historical battle between Nagi, Shiranui and Orochi. If the player started the game only after letting the "attract loop" play, which illustrated the exact same story slightly differently, it seemed to go on for a very very long time. It is possible to skip the cutscene <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">once you've already finished the game</a>, while the Wii remake also allows you to skip them on your first run through.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64">Paper Mario</a></em> is the only Mario RPG that explicitly prevents you from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">guarding and using timed hits</a> until it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready">explained by the tutorial</a> at the end of the lengthy prologue. Until then, battle is purely "hit and get hit", and the player is forced to use healing blocks and items to avoid dying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> can feel a bit slow at first. Then the game gets interesting—when Peach joins, when Bowser joins, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sammer's Kingdom is destroyed</span>, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> spends a few hours introducing the members of SEES (and Pharos) while the protagonist is evaluated for their potential. Once Akihiko contacts the group about the <em>massive</em> Shadow he's encountered, the game kicks up a notch and throws you straight into the fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is an odd case in that it just can't help but justify the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">Anthropic Principle</a>. You know as soon as you discover the TV world that you're going to wind up going to it and fighting monsters, but the characters react realistically rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">simply rushing in</a>, with the result that gameplay doesn't fully open up until about three hours in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, much like its predecessors, suffers from a slow beginning. Although it has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a> in order to set up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a>, the player then has to sit through 9 in-game days of set-up, during which there are very few meaningful choices to make. This can take about 5 hours of play-time, after which more ways to spend time start to be unlocked.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> franchise, it's annoyingly tedious to be shown how to catch Pokémon at the beginning of every game. Especially bad in a few of the games, where it's possible to catch a full, six-mon party of Pokémon <em>before</em> you receive this tutorial. Some people say that the most boring part of every single Pokémon game is the first few towns until the first gym battle. You knew everything that happens there years before the game was even made.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> are even worse about this than normal. Melemele Island, the first of the region's four main islands, is so aggressive with hand-holding that many players are discouraged from restarting for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">challenge run</a> simply to avoid going through it a second time. Once you reach Akala Island, the game starts to back off, and the story really starts to come through by the time you hit Ula'ula Island.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> not only has the same issues as <em>Sun and Moon</em> mentioned above, but also has the misfortune of being largely the same story as before, with only the Ultra Recon Squad making frequent but minor appearances. The story doesn't really start to diverge from the originals until the first visit to Aether Paradise, which is after completing the second (out of four) islands. This isn't so bad for those who didn't play the originals, but veterans will need a lot of patience while treading old ground.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeyYouPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeyYouPikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a></em> gets off to a weak start, mainly because you can't look away from your Pika-pal until he comes to live with you. Once you get full camera controls, the game opens up nicely.
</li></ul></li><li> There isn't any interactivity at <em>all</em> for the first hour or so of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PrincessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PrincessWaltz">Princess Waltz</a></em>. The first time you do anything other than click through dialogue is the battle at the end of Chapter Two... which promptly introduces you to the simple yet intricate card-battle system, at which point your interest gets reignited.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> starts off pretty slow where you just wander from room to room looking for keys to progress. You only fight some zombies and a few zombie dogs, but the battle with the giant snake is when things start to pick up a bit and the backstory via files start to reveal a lot more on what happened at the mansion grounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RetroGameChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RetroGameChallenge">Retro Game Challenge</a></em> opens up with the earliest, simplest game in the collection: <em>Cosmic Gate</em>. If you happen to not be a fan of <em>Galaga</em> then you're in for a bit of a bad time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em>: After the perfectly serviceable tutorial, you and your allies are killed at sea. Your body then sinks so far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheDrain">Down the Drain</a> that you end up in a network of boring underwater caves and ruins under the underworld before ol' Odin decides to revive you, which are filled with boring enemies like crabs, anemones and jellyfish (with occasional goblins, but they're very rare.) On your way to the surface, you then have to pass through Helheim, which is full of almost nothing but boring zombies. <em>Finally</em>, you get to the "land of the living", and the game gets vastly better from there on in. The intro is bad enough that it was probably partially responsible for the game's obscurity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a> III: BFE</em> starts out rather slowly with most of the enemies coming one by one. A pistol and a single shotgun are your only ranged weapons near the beginning. Taking cover is also necessary despite what the game's slogan is due to a lot of enemies having hitscan weapons. Near the end of the third level, first big battles start to happen and the pace of the game picks up a lot, and from there builds up to series standard in pretty short order. The lack of ranged weapons can be averted through finding secrets. Find the right ones and by the time you reach those first big battles you already have both shotguns, an assault rifle, and the laser gun; this still leaves you with little ammo for them until the point you normally acquire them, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> gets off to something of a slow start. You name your characters, get sent on a few tangential bits of exploration in the Shinjuku medical Center, find out about the end of the world, and get thrown back into the hospital, now able to save after the first 45 minutes. It's only after you do some battling, get a humble Pixie, and start getting used to recruiting demons that you begin to get to grips with the game. Even then, it's a few hours of linear dungeons and low-level demons before you get the Compendium and your Fusion options open up. Then you slog through the Underpass of Ginza and are confronted with Matador, the first boss that tests your knowledge of the game's mechanics and the fun challenge begins in earnest. From this point on, you get access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">the AMala Labyrinth</a>, fight your way through the trial in Ikebukuro, and can tackle the optional Fiend bosses and dungeons while you chart a path to the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>.
</li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em> players tend to give up before they enter Tokyo, as that's where the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a> and lack of varied environments ends and the player can start picking up attacks and weapons best-suited to eliminating entire enemy parties at once, which are vital especially given the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">lack of a defense stat</a> that leads to either the player's party emerging victorious or getting destroyed in about one or two turns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em>:
<ul><li> Starting off small can be rather boring for some, but this is also where you can make a lot of mistakes by expanding a city <em>too quickly</em> and going bankrupt or get into bad development habits. Particularly after the first, when you have to lay out a lot more to expand at all. Luckily, you can dive into working with an existing metropolis in all of the games, though you might have to turn disasters off in some scenarios.
</li><li> <em>Sim City 4</em> takes this to the extreme in the sense that they offer the regions of San Fransisco, New York City, and a generic "Fairview" as being <em>completely empty</em>, as in not one town to get you started, let alone your own custom regions start off blank. It can be frustrating to get the first few towns to grow, but after you get the regional population over 150,000, getting other cities to grow actually becomes incredibly easier and more strategically challenging as opposed to being pure frustration.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:

Notably some genius decided to put perhaps the hardest boss (FAR harder than ANYTHING in a Genesis Sonic game) in any Sonic game ever as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">THE FIRST BOSS</a>.
</li><li> The Westopolis stage is one of the worst opening stages in the entire Sonic franchise and probably helped lower the already rock-bottom public opinion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>. It exposes many of the game's flaws; the game starts becoming considerably more fun around the halfway point when better weapons deal with the targeting system's flaws when in close range. And in order to get the final ending of the game and face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, you have to get the game's ten normal endings. That means you have to play through Westopolis <em>ten times</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheSecretRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheSecretRings">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em> forces you to unlock many of the interesting abilities, going as far as to make you actually have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">unlock better controls.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheBlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheBlackKnight">Sonic and the Black Knight</a></em> isn't much better, although it's more tolerable at first, and gets <em>much</em> better by the end. It has less to do with gaining abilities and more to do with the player learning what to do combined with bad level design for the first couple stages. Right around Molten Mine, the game picks up significantly.
</li></ul></li><li> The early parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em> (presumably intentionally) seem like a generic, somewhat unpolished, modern military shooter. As it progresses, the story begins to play with and subvert the expected tropes, creating a more engaging experience. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">"Better" probably isn't the right word to describe the direction the plot takes, though.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>'s multiplayer: You start with one available weapon, one game mode, and one set of gear and must earn everything else by leveling up. The early battles are still fun, but it isn't until you've gained a few levels that other weapon types become available and the real variety of gameplay styles become apparent. When you hit level 10 and gain access to ranked battles, the game <em>really</em> opens up.
</li><li> The first hour or so of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> consists almost entirely of "run to this place, talk to this person, repeat." There's only two battles during the entire opening, and one is a tutorial.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler">Star Ruler</a></em>. At the start your industry is poor, your ships are short-legged, slow, weak and don't carry much ammo, early-game rushes are nearly impossible. It's only after some tech buildup that you can start making war in earnest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> has a lot of this, especially on the Republic Classes, and doubly so on the Jedi Consular.
<ul><li> The Consular's first act is hunting down Jedi Masters afflicted with a Dark Side plague, and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a>. But then Alderaan is seen, where the last Jedi Master is negotiating with the squabbling noble houses (and under the Dark side plague, making the civil war <em>worse</em>). The Consular, either way, shows up and <em>forces</em> a peace among those haughty nobles, establishing them as a first-rate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a> and setting into motion the events of Acts 2 and 3.
</li><li> A class's first Act comprises going to a planet, doing the same thing as they do on the other three planets (destroying a terrorist cell as the Agent, disabling a superweapon as the Knight, finding an artifact as the Sith Inquisitor, etc.), and then leaving. In comparison, Acts 2 and 3 generally have much more epic, tightly woven stories, with a clear objective, more interesting characters, and more of a sense of impact on the world as a whole. The stories become more interesting, too: The Imperial Agent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is brainwashed and uncovers an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a></span>, the Jedi Knight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> goes after the Emperor himself</span>, the Sith Inquisitor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becomes a Sith Lord, builds a power base, hunts ghosts and fights for their life against a Dark Council member who wants them dead</span>, etc.
</li><li> This hits some characters harder than others. While classes like the Imperial Agent and Jedi Knight still have fairly interesting stories (albeit much less so than their Act 2 and 3 stories), others can be a nightmare to get through. The Jedi Consular, as mentioned, is downright <em>painful</em> to get through at first, and the Sith Inquisitor doesn't fare much better (although the amount of funny dialog and downright insane plans like "steal a cult" and "become part colicoid to swim in toxic waste" they get in this section have their own appeal). Luckily, they get much better by Act 2.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> is slow to get going at first. You start off with a plot of farmland that's covered in vegetation and needs to be cleared out, all you get to start is some starting cash, and you use so much of your energy watering your crops one at a time that the only times you can really do anything else intensive (like going to the mines or chopping down trees <em>en masse</em>) are when it's raining. However as you grow your profits, your options open up, and by the second year you will likely have enough resources and tools (including upgraded versions of them) to do whatever you want.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series can take varying amounts of time to get to the best parts of the game, but <em>Suikoden V</em> is the real offender as far as this trope goes - it takes a good 10-15 hours (as in, probably the better part of a real-life day) to get past the initial go to various towns, talk to various people, see cutscenes, and okay, we'll let you fight a *few*battles here and there stage to where the game starts opening up, letting you get your base and actually starting to explore, recruit, and really get into the actual game. But once you do get past that, it's actually probably the best Suikoden game other than the revered <em>Suikoden II</em>. This is done intentionally, to get players really invested in caring about the nation of Falena and its people <em>before</em> the war gets started.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a> Original Generation</em> starts you off with one or two Gespensts (mass-produced units with only a handful of abilities) and maybe a fighter plane or two. It isn't until the cooler unique prototypes that it gets really interesting. Kyosuke's route isn't too bad though, as you get quickly several unique units and even some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robots</a>. Ryusei's, in the other hand, has no such luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a> 2</em>. You start the game in the moment you enroll with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">TriOptimum</a>. You go through the basic training (three simple and very quick tutorials) and then through three years of training... which amount to picking one of three doors, three times. Most fans agree this is an aversion, since it is very quick, especially if you want it to be quick. It works well as part of the intro - establishing your character, while the FMV-intro establishes the setting of the game. Nonetheless, the game also has a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>, and key plot developments are not revealed until you're almost done with a third of the main campaign.

Even worse is how expensive weapon and armor is, so every time you get a new character you have to waste a lot of time running around fighting monsters because you will not have enough money. But eventually you get all your characters geared up, Luke has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> moment, and the first traditional <em>Tales</em> plot twist happens, making the story actually interesting.

But then she loses those powers and the next few hours are spent travelling to Nia Khera, which forces the player to head from one identical harbor to small, very uninteresting towns connected by identically designed routes. The game does pick up again shortly after, but goes into another low point, before looking up again.
</li></ul></li><li> The first stage of <em>Tatsujin Ou</em> / <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Truxton II</a></em> mostly consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments">copy and paste</a> space and enemy patterns for several minutes until you reach actual scenery. Once you get to stage 2, the game picks up in variety, although it also gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">more difficult</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toribash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toribash">Toribash</a></em> starts off rather awkward and clumsy. There's a tutorial in the game, but a lot of players starting tend to only learn the most basic of moves, or just blindly enter inputs... then, as understanding of the physics, timing, tolerances, and power available sets in, players can start pulling off more impressive maneuvers, and by then even the basic default settings will allow for some rather spectacular (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">spectacularly gruesome</a>) feats.
</li><li> Whenever you recruit a new character, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> gives you an unskippable cutscene detailing his or her backstory. Some are good, some just have you mashing the X button in the irrational hope that it will do <em>something</em>. Notably, the intro to the entire game- which has to introduce the main character AND her first two companions- takes nearly <em>fifty minutes</em>. And there's also a prologue cutscene that plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">if you leave the game on the title screen without pressing start for a while</a>, sets up a plot twist later on, and is almost as long.
</li><li> The first stage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaiWaiWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaiWaiWorld">Wai Wai World</a> 2</em> is a slow, boring autoscroller that seemingly takes forever to end. Thankfully, the game gets more exciting the minute the second stage starts.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a>: Season Two</em> isn't all that interesting, with Clementine mostly on her own, while one of Telltale's greatest strengths is creating memorable characters and giving the player meaningful interactions with them. The overall direction of the story is also very vague. Once Clementine finally begins to be trusted by the new group of survivors near the end of episode one and the focus of the story is introduced early on in episode two, the game becomes the Walking Dead experience players know and love, and stays that way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em> starts you off with a stock vehicle that can top maybe 250 km/h at best. In order to be able to go toe-to-toe in Versus and Time Attack modes, you need to power up your vehicle through Story Mode, which depending on the game can take 60, 80, or even <em>100</em> stages, in a game that asks you to insert more credits after every stage. Once you hit full-tune, the "real" game opens up and you can start racing seriously with other players whether in real-time VS matches or in Ghost Battle mode and try your hand at Time Attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> certainly has this issue. While the Prologue might not seem that bad to first-time players, Chapter I probably will. The slow learning curve, slower pace, fair amount of backtracking and seemingly side-tracked plot ended up putting off some gamers - most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Yahtzee</a>. However, things get better in the next chapter, which is when the player's abilities start to diversify and the main story starts to pick up.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2">The Witcher 2</a> had a similar problem due to its inverse difficulty curve and barely-present tutorial. Some players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> the game after failing to beat the first encounter with enemy mooks. However, once you get a hang of the way the combat works and get some levels to unlock more abilities, it turns into a very rewarding experience.
</li></ul></li><li> The early levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> can be boring if you're not playing for the first time. You have only one or two skills and no talent points yet.
<ul><li> Especially the low level Barrens for the Horde. The zone is as exciting as it sounds, and it's extremely big, with plenty of quests that have you scour large areas to find those elusive kodos that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">just don't drop quest items as often as they should</a>. Even one of the quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> is constantly moving. And ganked repeatedly by the Alliance.
</li><li> Enormous areas of the game were made this when an expansion came out. Azeroth, the original two continents, were nearly totally abandoned when the Burning Crusade came out and everybody went to Outland. Only low levels and bank alts were left. Then the Wrath of the Lich King came out, and Outland was abandoned.
</li><li> Blizzard actually acknowledges the issue and throughout the second expansion was constantly improving it. They have cut the amount of experience needed for levels 1-60 several times, added XP gain in battlegrounds, introduced the whole new system for random dungeons which made it far easier to gather a party for them, <em>and</em> gives more loot and finally added several moderately challenging dungeons which awarded loot on par with lower level of previous raid tier. While the last addition removed the need for new players to farm several tiers of raids to finally get into actual content, it got hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">It's Easy, So It Sucks!</a>.
</li><li> <em>Cataclysm</em> takes it a step further. Most of the classic zones have been redesigned (the Barrens for example were split into two more manageable zones), the talent trees are completely revamped (and now give you first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a> for a chosen specialisation at level 10 instead of around 30), dungeons are readjusted for new level ranges, etc. It is very awesome.
</li></ul></li><li> The developmental league in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> Day of Reckoning</em>'s story mode. There's no storyline or anything interesting going on, it's all "Beat this guy," "OK, beat this guy using your finisher," "OK, beat this guy using a top-rope move," "OK, make this guy tap out..." and on and on and on. And you're fighting crappy nobody wrestlers that are just an amalgamation of CAW parts instead of the actual WWE guys you bought the game for. Overly realistic for many gamers.
</li><li> Endemic to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series.

Recently the devs have been trying to reduce the lead time and make the games more accessible to new players. The first game was by far the worst, starting you off without a time compressor, in a setting that is much more liberal with the scale of space than usual. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Assuming you know exactly what to buy and where</a>, your first trading run <strong>will</strong> take <em>half an hour</em>.

After that point, more of the side missions that make up the bulk of the game's content becomes available. But even then, things don't <em>really</em> pick up until you've unlocked your Skell and the flight module, which both make exploration and combat much easier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>: The game takes its sweet time to introduce the world, characters, and especially it's broad, often complicated mechanics. It'll take abou 2 hours just to finish the initial chapter, 1 hours and a half of which, you'll spend before meeting the story's heroine Pyra, and therefore, before introducing the Blade System to the player, one of the core mechanics of the game's battle system. The game will still be introducing things to you for a much longer while, some players say that the game finally picks up in chapter 3 or 5, at which point you should finally have a full party, though some players state it takes until chapter 7 to do so.

</li></ul></li><li> A good amount of visual novels have slow paced beginnings, or a lot of filler before something interesting really happens. Doesn't help that there are common routes and specific character paths. There are visual novels with extremely long common routes that take about 10 hours (or even more) to complete - after you finish that, you will be able to proceed to a character's route.
<ul><li> <em>Yume Miru Kusuri</em> has gotten some complaints because the slice of life elements in the beginning can be kind of boring. It's basically the guy just going to school, talking to some people, then going to work, etc. Rinse and repeat for a good hour or so. YMK is a character-driven game so you might want to skip right to the parts where you talk to the girl you like.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SubarashikiHibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SubarashikiHibi">Subarashiki Hibi</a></em> has a rough start can be tedious to people who are expecting crazy stuff (this visual novel has a certain reputation...).

While most of its fans know the series as a post-apocalyptic drama set in a world where humanity is on the brink of annihilation, the series actually starts out with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MuvLuvExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MuvLuvExtra">Muv-Luv Extra</a></em>, a light-hearted romantic comedy with no apocalyptic elements whatsoever that essentially serves as an origin story for the main cast.

</li><li> "The Wadsworth Principle" is this in regards to videos like those found on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. It's an axiom which states that the first 30% of any video can be skipped because it contains no worthwhile or interesting information. There are even Python scripts and websites that automatically do this to videos for you.
<div class="indent"> "For EVERY youtube video, I always open the video and then immediately punch the slider bar to about 30 percent. For example, in this video, it should have just started at 0:40. Everything before 0:40 was a waste. This holds true for nearly every video in the universe."

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> starts off by throwing the viewer into the deep end of the show's absurdist comedy, and it can take quite a while to get a handle on the setting and characterization due to how little continuity there is. It isn't until about halfway through the second season that the interpersonal relationships between the characters get more focus, and the show starts to build continuity within the setting. Then in the S2 finale, the Lich appears, and things really come together.
</li><li> Many people agree the first half of season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> is mostly non-humorous political humor that was outdated before it even aired, in addition to having <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">cutaway gags</a>. Thankfully, the second half of season 1 saw to it to get rid of many of the political humor, as well as completely removing the cutaways. Ever since then, it has been wildly regarded as the funniest animated series on Fox.
</li><li> It takes about 3/4 of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> for it to really hit its stride story wise. Its not until Aang, Katara, and Sokka get to the Northern Water Tribe that the show ditches the world building for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that carries throughout the rest of the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Season 1 begins not with the founding of The Avengers, but with about two hours' worth of shorts detailing how each of the first eight members fought crime <em>before</em> becoming part of the team. Regardless of whether you watch each short one by one, or watch the five episodes compiling them, they make a rather disjointed introduction to the show.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1041b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1041b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1041b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The individual shorts were released in an order that caused the heroes' exploits to constantly interrupt one another, while the episodes compile them in a manner that sometimes fails to give each hero equal prominence.</span> Even after the Avengers get founded, it takes six <em>more</em> episodes for all eight of those superheroes to join. However, a number of the episodes detailing the team's founding and early expansions became regarded nearly as high as those that followed, if not more so.
</li><li> Season 2 takes its sweet time for the team to realize there is a mole on their team, this being the BIG cliffhanger from season 1. We're also waiting for the one person who figured this out to escape from the mole's prison. He escapes in episode 9. The arc is 13 episodes long, but the climax and payoff are well worth it as the build-up finally begins to merge and pay off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> for its first few episodes is a very run-of-the-mill action show with mostly one-note and at times annoying characters and basic plots. The pilot in particular is just a slow-paced setup full of exposition and a <em>very</em> simple story that's basically just an excuse to have a huge fight scene. It isn't until about the first season's half-point that the characters settle into their roles and a continuous storyline begins to take shape. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The writers admittedly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">had no idea what to do with the show</a> in the beginning, but thankfully they were able to tie the random plot-points they had laid out into a mostly coherent story by the season finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman">Beware the Batman</a></em> is fairly episodic at first, and Tatsu is just introduced as a civilian who has not yet become the vigilante Katana. The first few episodes develop her character through minor scenes and B-plots. It's not until the seventh episode, "Family", where she finds out the truth about Bruce Wayne and Batman, she fights alongside Batman against the common threat of the League of Assassins, and the first actual story arc of the season officially kicks into place. The series becomes increasingly serialized after that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> didn't impress too many people with its first few episodes; while not <em>bad</em>, they didn't look like much more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark">typical adult animated sitcom</a>, complete with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gags</a> and an unsympathetic protagonist. Around halfway through the first season, however, it revealed itself to be more of a thoughtful character study with surprising emotional heft. When the creator <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/z42p3s-cueg?t=407">talked about this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> years later, he revealed that he wishes he made the build up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToneShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToneShift">Tone Shift</a> more obvious or just had the show as a tragicomedy from the start.
<div class="indent"><em>There are clues in the beginning, and I think because of the context of it being an adult animated show, people didn't see those clues. (...) I remember reading reviews of the first season, and one said "for a show that is meant to be just wall-to-wall jokes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint">there sure are a lot of scenes that don't have that many jokes</a>." And I thought, "You're so close."</em>
</div></li><li> The first couple of episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> are considered decent but nothing really special. It's not until the fairly serious first season finale that it starts getting good.
</li><li> While the villain scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> are consistently humorous through the entire series, the heroes spend most of the early run being thoroughly humourless and bland, with very little effort put into developing their mythos and world, or even just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">having them look sympathetic against the Urpneys</a>, making the show incredibly uneven. Season Three onwards starts to give more side plots for the heroes' duties and travels, with a lot more surreal world building present. Rufus and Amberley also gain more comedic, snarky personalities to make their scenes as enjoyable as the Urpneys'.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> started off slow, with Dipper and Mabel encountering random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monsters Of The Week</a> with slight hints at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. While the show was still popular during this time, it wasn't until the exciting two-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>, which introduces the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and ends with major secrets starting to come to light, that the show's plot really picked up.
</li><li> The animated part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GertieTheDinosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GertieTheDinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a></em> comes when the film is about halfway done. Of course, the whole thing is less than fifteen minutes long. Despite this, there was still a version made that cut the non-animated first half out.
</li><li> While they still caught some viewers' attention by being very different from G3 and 3.5, which are generally considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>, the first couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episodes are heavily clichéd and predictable. While these episodes certainly aren't <em>bad</em> exactly, they didn't do much to establish their own identity. The show's explosion in popularity would occur at the beginning of the second season, with a villain named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfChaos">Discord</a> chewing the scenery, followed by a solid string of great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> episodes; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero">one of which</a> is still considered one of the best in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KulipariAnArmyOfFrogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KulipariAnArmyOfFrogs">Kulipari: An Army of Frogs</a></em> takes its time establishing its setting and characters, not even getting to introducing the titular Kulipari until episode 7, halfway into the first season and the plot becomes more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptation</a> from there, culminating in the first book being told in 9 episodes, but books 2 and 3 only getting two episodes each which results in the plot moving so fast, things don't even really make sense unless you've read the books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> can be a disorienting experience for newcomers, as the first half of season one provides only the smallest of hints that something bigger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> adventures with a boy with a gem for a bellybutton and his mother figures is going on. The series formally introduces its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> in "Lion 2: The Movie", seventeen episodes in, with the midseason two-parter being the point that both fans and the show's creators believe <em>Steven Universe</em> begins to truly pick up speed and more frequently display the rich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> it has since become known for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> starts off with only relatively small amounts of continuity and foreshadowing, and doesn't pick up the pace until at least halfway through the rather lengthy first season. It's especially slow compared to season 3, where nearly every episode is part of a longer storyline, due partially to the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> and partially to the show's cancellation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">looming on the horizon</a>.
