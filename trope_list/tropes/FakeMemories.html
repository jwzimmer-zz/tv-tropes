</p><p>In these cases they implant Fake Memories, using things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeuralImplanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeuralImplanting">computers</a>, or the week's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> to replace true memories with more convenient false ones.
</p><p>Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionSnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionSnapBack">this never works as planned.</a> Like an itch they can't scratch, the character with tampered memories will notice things aren't as they should be and scratch at the false memories like a scab, questioning their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyUnverifiableCoverStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyUnverifiableCoverStory">"Past"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade">searching for the truth.</a> Or go crazy trying. Occasionally, a hero will leave a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoteToSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoteToSelf">Note to Self</a> or instructions for friends to help. The irony being that the false memories tend to lead the character right back to the people who erased them with enough of an advantage to take them out.
A darker, more sinister version of this trope is when the character in question realizes his memories don't add up, but doesn't know <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly">which</a></em> set of memories is true. Often self-inflicted, these memories are slowly revealed through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream">dream sequences</a>, and the experience tends to come with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about the frailty of human mind and the subjectivity of memory.

Rukia is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">particularly trigger-happy</a> with the device that does it. The Soul Reaper has no control over the replacement memories the target ends up with, resulting in sometimes outlandish results. Ichigo's family thinks everyone slept through a lorry crashing into the side of their house to explain the devastation caused by a Hollow attack that almost killed them; Orihime's bizarre tale for the devastation a Hollow attack causes to her house, is only accepted by everyone because Orihime's fantastic imagination is infamous. Orihime, however, turns out to be immune to the device because she possesses spiritual power.
</li><li> Tsukishima describes his ability as the power to change the past of the person he cuts. He is able to implant memories in those he stabs, making them believe they were always his friends. It's used to agonizing effect to cause Ichigo's friends and family think he is their ally and Ichigo the one acting strange. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsukishima even takes Ichigo's place in their adventures; they think he was the awesome hero who, among other things, defeated Aizen (instead of Ichigo), rescued Orihime from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> to raise her (instead of her brother Sora), and took care of Chad and gave him his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansPlotTrinket">Orphan's Plot Trinket</a> (instead of Oscar, his "Abuelo").

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">the original manga</a>, the antagonist gets a random garbage man to do some hacking jobs for him by promising to help him getting back his wife and daughter, which both never existed. The adaptation of the story for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">the 1995 movie</a> had the mook who was the garbage man's direct contact be told that he had been mind wiped, leaving only the basics of his cover identity with no knowledge about his actual boss. In both cases, it works flawlessly until someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread">Pulls The Thread</a>. The garbage man is told that it's impossible to completely erase the false memories.

<ul><li> The second season begins with Lelouch living a quiet, peaceful life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only after C.C. makes contact with him does he remember being captured and given Fake Memories by his father the Emperor, causing him to forget his beloved mother Marianne and sister Nunnally and having been the terrorist Zero, as well as convincing him that the spy Rolo Haliburton is actually his younger brother.</span> Not only that, but <em>everyone</em> in the school is given exactly the same fake memories to make the effect even stronger. They all believe that Lelouch is nothing more and nothing less than a fellow student, and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rolo is his brother, whereas Nunally is merely a pretty and kind Britannian princess that later becomes the Viceroy of Area 11</span>. And <em>then</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shirley has her true memories back via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Jeremiah</a>, but at some point she happens to mention Nunnally <em>while speaking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Rolo</a></em>..</span>.

It <em>really</em> fucks up with her self-worth, as the poor girl never knows which memories are hers or not</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die The TV Series</a></em> has Joker stating that the British Library did this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Paper Sisters. Anita was originally a British Library test subject, and Maggie and Michelle were former Dokusensha Agents who were modified. Dokusensha had tried this before, but previous test subjects went insane. Joker tried telling them that even their memories of meeting each other for the first time were false, but they decide it doesn't matter. The ending shows the viewers the statue of Mary and Jesus in the church where they met, with their initials carved into the base; telling us that the events they remember from that point on were their own</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kaiba">Kaiba</a></em>, this is done to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neiro</span>.

</li><li> In another episode, the team discovers a village on toxic planet protected by a force field. Each villager also have a direct mental link to the city computer (like an always available <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> to seek information). When suddenly villagers memory starts to contradict events from the previous days, the team discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the computer can't sustain the energy field due to a power shortage and slowly shrink it. Since it cannot hold as many people, it uses the mental link to send people outside the shield to die and modify the other villagers' memory so no one is mourning the death of people they can't remember</span>. Since the team isn't linked to the computer, they are not affected by false memory and can discover the truth.
</li><li> And yet another (it appears that <em>Stargate</em> loves this trope): SG-1 was given "memory stamps" to believe they're part of a tiny colony working day and night to keep their civilization going during a massive ice age. Truth is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the ice age is on the wane, but a privileged class is keeping the workers at it for the extra energy. SG-1 found out and had to be hidden away. Teal'c jinxes the attempt because he forgets he needs to meditate and his symbiote literally can't restore his health until he does</span>.
</li><li> And one more: Mitchell is implanted with fake memories to frame him for a crime. Turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the real murderer erased his own memories of the crime, then grieves over the victim's death and helps SG-1 track down the real killer</span>.

</li><li> As in the page quote, there's some questions throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series about whether the Shadow you play as is in fact the "real Shadow". In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> these questions come about when Rouge finds information on the original Project Shadow, the Biolizard. The question is never actually answered, but the caption before fighting Biolizard refers to it as "the prototype of the ultimate life", meaning that there is a final product: Shadow the Hedgehog. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2 Battle</em>, this is modified to suggest that the ultimate lifeform is either Shadow or Sonic the Hedgehog, although only Shadow has reason to suspect this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, it comes up again, as several Shadow Androids are discovered, leading Rouge to believe that Shadow is a robot himself. It's finally settled in (what else?) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>, but only if you take long enough at the final boss to hear Eggman tell you that you're the real Shadow. The various endings throughout the game vary between Shadow accepting himself as real, or as an android.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To sum up: Biolizard is created as an ultimate life form. Shadow is then created as the ultimate life form as well, using extra alien DNA. Then, Shadow nearly died, got recovered by Eggman with amnesia. He used Shadow's template to create a bunch of robots. So, Shadow's fake memories are real memories... but since (as Eggman acknowledges) this was not the result of Project Shadow, Shadow the Hedgehog is the "real" one.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Human memory is highly fallible and prone to filling in gaps, and is deeply vulnerable to pre- and post- event suggestions of what happened, regardless of what actually happened. Incorrect memories can be formed under a number of circumstances, especially periods of high stress or adrenaline. There is a video of a police officer firing a full magazine, reloading, and firing again, in front of a dashboard camera the officer set himself, and then thinking he only fired his gun twice.
<ul><li> Another video of a police officer went similar: the police officer, in this case a black woman, stopped her car at a traffic light. An elderly white man on crutches stood on the sidewalk, waiting for the green signal. Suddenly she went out of the car and hurdled abuse on him, claiming he called her a nigger, then threatened violence against him. Dashcam and sound recordings proved he did not provoke her in any way, but she testified that he did before being shown what actually happened, and could not believe it.
</li></ul></li><li> Anton-Babinski syndrome, or Anton's Blindness, is a condition in which an individual is blind to a large degree, but makes up an entirely false imagination, experience, and memory of vision. It's very rare, but interesting enough to be seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a> MD</em>.
<ul><li> Human visual analysis was proved to be error-suppressing. If a little part of the eye's field of vision is partially blocked by something immovable <em>relative to the eyeball</em>, this part is filled with "repaired" texture extrapolated from the rest of the scene. Sorry guys — error tolerance, lack of artifacts, good signal-to-noise ratio and high sensitivity seem to not to be fully compatible qualities.
</li><li> The reverse can also happen, a phenomenon known as Hysterical Blindness. A person can see completely, but is fully convinced they are blind. (It's tested by having people who are actually blind/them go through a room. They either have close to 0% success, or close to 100% success at key tasks, while people who are actually blind have about 50% success.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the most infamous real-life case of this trope, between 1980-1995 the United States and elsewhere experienced a number of trials in which children's day care center owners and staff were accused of Satanic ritual abuse, based entirely on testimony that was simply impossible, which the individual did not remember until after being questioned. The "recovered memory" testimony was discredited after a psychologist testified that the techniques used for "recovering suppressed memories" were exactly the ones she had been using in research to create false memories.
<ul><li> The real clincher was the "Impossible Bunny" experiment. Using the same techniques used to "reveal" memories of abuse, a researcher got somebody to recall meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disneyland</a>...something which is impossible, due to Bugs not being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> character, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> one.
</li><li> More generally, it's been demonstrated that even without this prompting many real victims of crime can have their memories falsified, just by things like being shown the picture of a suspect that wasn't the actual perpetrator. The "show-up" where a victim is presented with the suspect on their own, in a picture or personally, is particularly suggestive. Many suspects were wrongly convicted of crimes due to mistaken eyewitness testimony, and only exonerated by objective evidence like DNA testing (it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">does not do one good</a> to think of how many are probably still in prison where this does not exist). In the US, it's especially disturbing that a number of them were sentenced to <em>death</em> and in some cases came just days away from being killed.
</li></ul></li><li> The most common form of false memory creation operates by something called the misinformation effect. As an example: If you ask someone to recall a scene (say, of a car accident) and the ask them if they saw "<em>the</em> STOP sign" as opposed to "<em>a</em> STOP sign", the majority of participants will report- and sincerely believe- that they witnessed such a signpost, even if there was no such sign in the original scene. This is a major problem with eyewitness testimony interviews.
</li><li> There is also the process of refutation. When we receive information, the brain considers it as just it would any other input- say, seeing or hearing it. If if the brain does not have sufficient information to refute this new suggestion, or if the process of refutation is simply disrupted or prevented from occurring properly- which is precisely the function of hypnosis- then we are inclined to accept that information as true.
<ul><li> For instance, even if you weren't even at an entire event, if a relative or friend mistakes you for being there and insists that you were there, you can end up creating your own memories of those events because you begin to second-guess yourself. "I wasn't there, I'm sure of it...was I?"
</li></ul></li><li> The ease with which false memories can be implanted actually borders on terrifying. There are quite a few cases of bad lineup procedure causing witnesses to 'rewrite' their memories, resulting such absurd things as people getting wrongly convicted merely because they happened to have a <em>sign</em> above their head, or were the right answer to "Which of these is not like the others?" Perhaps the worst part is that the witnesses may even be flat-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">''certain'' that their choice from the line-up is the right person, despite whatever later hard evidence proves.</a> This frequently leads to harassment of the first person accused of a crime long after they are acquitted, <em>and the actual guilty party has been found and convicted</em>.
</li><li> Increasing amounts of research demonstrate that memory is as malleable as <em>sand</em>. It's possible to recall a memory, specifically have someone change a part of that memory through forceful suggestion, and then believe that that's actually what happened. While scary, it has practical applications: soldiers suffering from PTSD can be asked to relive the memory, then use specific drugs (in this case, beta blockers) to rewrite the memory and remove the shellshock. It's not an instant fix, however, requiring multiple treatments.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, your brain does <em>not</em> record everything that ever happened to you, so attempts to "uncover" stuff you don't remember will lead to Fake Memories quite often. Your brain only registers impressions, not straight sensory input, and if you weren't paying attention to an event (or never experienced it in the first place), there might be no record of it in your mind. (This is why you can lose your keys and rack your brains trying to "remember" where you left them, and fail — if you weren't paying attention when you dropped the keys, your brain may not have registered the event at all, and you're trying to retrieve a memory that simply doesn't exist.)
<ul><li> It is possible to have incredible passive recall, however. This takes several forms:
</li><li> Savants capable of recalling entire books, or huge numbers of digits of pi do so by focusing entirely on something they are paying attention to. This variety is no better at remembering things outside of their area of memorization than anyone else.
</li><li> Competitive memory champions practice constantly to develop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> variant of this, focusing on honing highly efficient methods of short and long term recall. When they are not actively paying attention to memorizing something, their accuracy drops sharply, but remains significantly above the average person's passive retention.
</li><li> The condition known as Hyperthymesia is a rare condition in an individual recalls with great accuracy the major and minor events of every day of their personal lives. Recall of events outside of their own lives, however, is significantly less accurate.
</li><li> The rarest form, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">only recently experimentally proven to actually exist</a> is true Eidetic Memory. These individuals, of which fewer than 20 have been confirmed so far, are capable of recalling with <em>extreme</em> levels of accuracy not only their personal lives, but minute details like the weather and minor news stories of any given date past early childhood. Research is ongoing into exactly how they are able to do this, but the current leading hypothesis is that in these individuals the normal mechanisms the brain uses to filter what information is worth memorizing and what can be safely forgotten are disrupted, while the mechanisms that the brain uses to organize and correlate memories and chronological information are hyper efficient. In one test, an individual with true eidetic memory was able to recall with near-perfect accuracy the pairings of major league baseball teams on given dates from the mid 70's. The individual was not a baseball fan.
<ul><li> One reason true eidetic memory enjoys the profile it has despite its extreme rarity is it just so happens that one of these extremely few people in the world who has it is Marilu Henner, already a celebrity as an actress (best known as Elaine Nardo on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>). Henner's friend Lesley Stahl chose to involve her in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> story on eidetic memory because she recognized that Henner had the condition from how it was described to her. She makes for an ideal subject in the experimental testing that researchers do on people with true eidetic memory because, as a public figure, it's very easy to find out verifiable information about her past.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Even the collective memory is prone to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation">fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, at times totally different from recorded evidence.
<ul><li> To demonstrate that this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">Roman historian</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html">Suetonius mentions<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2z7lx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2z7lx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2z7lx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">6.2</span> that news of a failed usurpation against the emperor Domitian became so widespread in Rome that people swore that they personally saw his head paraded around the streets of the city, despite the implausibility of that scenario.
</li><li> Many viewers supposedly remember scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em> when it was shown in theaters such as Ron playing Quidditch. This is impossible as those things were <em>never</em> shot for this film.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> was first released on VHS, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeContinued">To Be Continued</a> caption was added at the end to set up the coming sequel. Many people "remember" seeing this caption when the movie was originally in theaters and the filmmakers have had a hard time convincing them that this would be impossible. At the time, most of the films directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> had flopped and so his only hope for <em>Back to the Future</em> was that it would make its money back. There were certainly no sequels planned at that stage.
</li><li> Similarly, many people remember seeing the scene on Tatooine between Luke and Biggs in the original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a> (watch it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsDE7o_o26E">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) which has never been included in the actual film. However, stills from the scene were publicized at the time and the scene was included in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">Comic-Book Adaptation</a>. Plus, this was in the days before VHS.
<ul><li> The scenes with Biggs on Tatooine <em>were</em> included on a CD-ROM version of Star Wars called ''Behind the Magic." Some one seeing this might have "remembered" them from the movie, or misremembered them being in the Special Edition version.
</li><li> There are endless debates on the nature of Threepio's silver leg, with some fans clearly remembering the leg being gold in <em>A New Hope</em> despite the fact that every single behind the scenes photo show it being silver.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, countless fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> "remember" that the first time they saw the movie (either on TV or on an early VHS), the camera panned down at the end to reveal the Ruby Slippers under Dorothy's bed, proving that her adventure in Oz was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Real After All</a>. No such ending to the movie has ever existed.
</li><li> During the 2002 <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beltway_sniper_attacks">Beltway sniper attacks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, many witnesses reported having seen a white van; it turned out the killers used a blue Chevy Caprice.
</li><li> The Mandela Effect stems from this trope; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArkhamsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArkhamsRazor">it hypothesizes</a> that fake memories are in fact glimpses into alternate universes. Its name is derived from a blog post where the OP said that she thought she remembered Nelson Mandela dying in prison, and shared that memory with several people at Dragoncon 2005, when in fact he was still alive at the time (he died in 2013). The more prosaic explanation is that people were mixing up Mandela and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko">Steve Biko<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A much lighter example often cited by Mandela Effect proponents is people having memories of a kid-friendly comedy movie in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> called <em>Shazaam</em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sinbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sinbad">Sinbad</a> as a genie, which they insist was completely different from the well-documented Shaquille O'Neal genie movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kazaam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kazaam">Kazaam</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Last Thursdayism is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyReligion">satirical</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">we hope</a>) religious doctrine that claims God created the entire universe last Thursday, and that any evidence of the world existing before then (including our own memories) were implanted by God to trick us.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus">Elizabeth Loftus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> carried out much of the original psychological research to prove the fallibility of human memory, and repeatedly served as an expert witness in court cases to impress on the jury the inherent unreliability of eyewitness testimony.
</li><li> A rather funny example. Artist Gianluca Gimini did an art project where he would ask a bunch of people to draw a bicycle from memory then create an image of what the bike would look like in a real life using a 3d program. The results can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/35437979/Velocipedia">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and often include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> mistakes such as having the chain run between both wheels (which would make it almost impossible to turn the bike) or even leaving out vital features all together. The reason for this? While almost everyone knows more or less what a bike looks like, people asking to picture one on the spot tend to leave out the finer details, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">just fill them in with whatever their brains happen to come up with at the time</a>.
