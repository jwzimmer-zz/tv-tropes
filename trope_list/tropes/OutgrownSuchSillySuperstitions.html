A society may consider religion backward and primitive, consider it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">dangerous tool for controlling the populace</a>, or have discovered it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion">Scam Religion</a>.

Part of this is because of the demographics of science fiction writers; especially in the "Golden Age" of sci-fi, empiricists and secular humanists were particularly attracted to the genre. A common variation of this trope sees the "advanced" society <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical">show the "primitive" society the error of its ways</a> and prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresentsWereNeverFromSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePresentsWereNeverFromSanta">The Presents Were Never from Santa</a>. Since then, sci-fi has become more mainstream (and the militant atheist a more annoying character), so this trope's usage has become more nuanced. Nowadays, you might find a society that discovered it was worshipping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">advanced technology</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>. You might even see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverse</a>, where an atheistic society discovers for whatever reason that it kind of <em>needed</em> silly superstition to function, or even the God or gods they worshiped being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsRight">proven true</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, religious beliefs are close to non-existent, which is explained as a result of people becoming disillusioned over religion after a nuclear holocaust mentioned in the backstory. The only organised religion present in the series, the Terraist Church, turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Path of Inspiration</a> which aims to revive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet">Earth</a>'s past glory through subversive actions such as assassinating key figures of the galaxy.
</li><li> Religion is rarely mentioned in the classic Universal Century timeline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>. In fact, the UC calendar was originally established in order to invoke this trope and usher in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">utopian age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">for mankind</a>. There is still room from any number of fringe cults, but these mostly have political ulterior motives, such as the Zanscare Empire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> or the myriad manifestations of Zeon ideology.
<ul><li> Defied in 0096 Unicorn: The reason why spacenoids had such a fervent worship of Christianity, which transitioned to a blind obedience to Zeon philosophy, was because they had nothing else to live for or hope with in the cold, resource-scare void of space. As Marida explains, the Universal Century was anything but atheist for the poverty-stricken colonists.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Lloyd</a> lightly teases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Suzaku</a> about how the Japanese still believes in such superstitions.
</li><li> A modern-day variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em>; according to <em>Another Side: Earthbound</em>, one of the key reasons for Toshiki running for mayor was to try and invoke this in Itomori and break the hold that the Miyamizu and their Shinto beliefs have traditionally held over the town after Futaba's death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn">shattered his faith in the gods</a>. He realises almost too late that there is indeed truth in the legends he sneered at.
</li><li> Averted and even inverted in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland">Alice in Borderland</a></em>. At one point, some of the characters wonder how they ended up in a strange world that requires them to play deadly games to keep living. One character, a forensic scientist, muses about different supernatural and spiritual reasons they might be there. Another character asks how a scientist could still believe such things, and she replies that science has only been able to take humanity so far, and at some point there are big things that even science hasn't yet been able to tell them.

This means most people will follow leaders based on their ability to evoke that response rather than their ability to encourage survival. It also means that most people would be quite willing to surrender their free will to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">powerful forces that don't even see them as bacteria</a>.

Of course, even they haven't figured out how the Matrix functions. And they become oddly quiet when the subject of the built-in kill-switch every Cybertronian has comes up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BaitAndSwitchSTO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BaitAndSwitchSTO">Bait and Switch (STO)</a></em>:

The author has mentioned in forum posts that the trope annoys him.

Yomi effortlessly takes over the world and no one can do anything about it until the Mane Six arrive and bring back magic.

</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LookingIntoEnemyEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LookingIntoEnemyEyes">Looking Into Enemy Eyes</a></em>, a Bajoran in the USS <em>George Hammond</em>'s science department offers an interpretation of Klingon misotheism that stems from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a> inflicted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">the H'urq invasion</a>.

Of course, the Force is very real in-universe, making this a case of widespread ignorance or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat Earth Atheism.</a> Han outright states that he doesn't believe in it (before he sees it for himself), and even an Imperial officer challenges Darth Vader directly on the Force's existence (or at least it's usefulness). It ends badly for him:

</div><ul><li> Aside from this however it seems to be mostly played straight for the movies, which don't mention religion (aside from the Ewoks thinking Threepio's a god, but that also fits the trope). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> materials are another story though.

And make whatever you like of Threepio's declarations of "Thank the Maker!"
</li><li> The old EU treated the Force as being more or less irrelevant to anyone who wasn't a Jedi or Sith, and most denizens of the galaxy were only vaguely aware that the two were different beyond being a petty religious schism. The new EU has introduced it as a more wide-spread religion which the Empire suppressed and which made a comeback after it fell. It was also confirmed that "the Maker" is a creator god which some believe in.
</li><li> The new EU has the Empire attempt to enforce this by banning religion and belief in the supernatural generally, though there are underground religions around despite this, as you'd expect.

</li><li> <em>The Light of Other Days</em>, co-written with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a>, had a device that could see into the past. It proves, among other things, that Moses didn't exist, but was rather a merger of several different historical personages. Jesus did, but he was just a good person who inspired people, rather than a miracle-maker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildhoodsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildhoodsEnd">Childhood's End</a></em> has a similar device, which winds up discrediting every religion save Buddhism.

And that was all in the exposition. There is one religion left practicing (a Buddhist-type), but it leaves its monastery when the yellow butterflies reach the top of the hill it's on, simply because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">they were prophesied to do it.</a> It is mentioned that Vatican still exists as a center of Catholicism, but it suffers from severe financial troubles, implying that the number of practicing Catholics is minuscule.

The setting has humanity already in religious decline by default, but the very end of the series presents not only possible evidence for the existence of a divine being such as God, but an explanation for his laissez-faire attitude to dealing with his creation.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Culture</a></em> novels, the Culture looks at religion as a delusion which is deserving of sympathy. This viewpoint runs into trouble in <em>Look to Windward</em>, where the "enlightened" races are irritated and nonplussed that whether or not the Chelgrian heaven existed before, it demonstrably exists <em>now</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceDetail">Surface Detail</a></em> features sophisticated virtual reality environments, many of which are based on each religion's hell, which proves to be a contentious issue in galactic politics.
</li><li> <em>The Algebraist</em> features a future religion that actually fits in a science fiction setting. The dogma is that the universe is a simulation, and the goal is to end the simulation by getting enough of the participants in the simulation to realize that they are in one. The main character of <em>The Algebraist</em> seems skeptical of this religion, though. The simulation hypothesis is also brought up in the <em>Culture</em> novel <em>Matter</em>, without a religion surrounding it.

It features a totally agnostic — if not atheistic — alien race that also live in a perfect world and society, facing a bombed-out, nuclear-fried, and heavily Catholic human race. The priest included in the first contact mission considered that society a danger to humanity precisely because it was a rationalistic atheistic utopia; unfortunately, he'd already befriended one of those people before he made the decision.

The expressions "Jays" and "by all that's holy" are still in use, but only as swears.
</li><li> Caffrey's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowerAndTheHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowerAndTheHive">Talents</a></em> series plays this mostly straight. Those few protagonists who espouse a belief in a higher power are, at most, vaguely Deist. Those who are openly devout are almost always portrayed as mentally unstable troublemakers. Organized religious populations are shunted to backwater worlds where "the harm they can do is minimized."
</li><li> The elves of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> have outgrown religion; however, Eragon is slightly distrustful of the elves' atheism, and in the third book, a being that's pretty hard to interprete as anything other than a Dwarven god appears to bless their new king.

Hamilton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightsDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightsDawn">Night's Dawn</a></em> trilogy, the rival powers in the Confederation are the staunchly atheist Edenists and the staunchly Christian Kulu Kingdom. The Edenists' philosophy and way of life lead to the closest thing to paradise as one can get, and they're also the only humans who can fully resist the possessed.

Although they are not officially atheistic, few members hold onto any religious beliefs. In the outside world, religions rise and fall unnoticed. While venturing in the outside world, monks can quickly reduce any religion they encounter into one of a number of basic categories so that they can avoid causing offense. Religious non-monks are mostly presented as morons, while the brightest are good enough that they aren't completely humiliated when they try to debate with a monk.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> novels uses a variation; although humans and several other species seek guidance from the United Church, which has a Unitarian-style philosophy where people only look for ethical guidance and don't buy into the ritualistic aspects of religion that fall under this trope's "superstition" label.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies">Uglies</a></em> series, the people of the future sarcastically refer to gods as "invisible superheroes in the sky".

But one of the most prominent characters was Madrak the Mighty, a warrior-priest "of the non-theistic, non-sectarian sort", whose personal religion was based on an agnostic's deity — another character referred to him as a "holy ambulance-chaser". When Set the Destroyer pointed out to him that Madrak had just aided in the destruction of the Nameless, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> from beyond the universe, <em>which perfectly fit the definition of Madrak's agnostic God,</em> the idea that his god existed — and that he profited by its death — made him suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">a crisis of faith</a>.

This might seem even odder when one considers that Wright is a devout traditionalist Catholic, except that he wrote the trilogy before he converted.

After their resettlement onto a new planet (which is coincidentally hand crafted by a god, Raven 12345 herself) with the help of Hao Ren and his party, the Aerym elves, a solar-system civilization with no FTL technology, decide to set up a religion worshipping Raven 12345 to maintain social order and give hope to the people.

Some of the worlds view religion in this manner, especially on the planet Tranai, which is ruled by "humane communism". Some other worlds are ruled by theocracies, such as the Holy Archonate on Murphy, which is recovering from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">comet strike</a>. The eponymous captain believes theocracy is part of an ever-changing cycle of "democratic" governments; only an enlightened monarchy can avoid it.

However, at least a sixth of them are still Christian, the biggest church has brought back the Inquisition (although more as a PR mechanism than a torture campaign), and the protagonist Inquisitor discovers a group that has figured out that there's no God, but still sets up sham religions because most people can't handle the truth.

Both will vigorously deny that any being or force more powerful than themselves could exist or have an impact on the world (the first book's appendix indicates that the Sartan are essentially Deist, believing a creator god exists but has no impact on the present world; the Patryns have no gods whatsoever, though they revere their leader Lord Xar as a sort of messiah) and consider active belief in such to be a "silly superstition" at best and heresy at worst. However, as the series progresses it becomes apparent that actual divine powers do exist, culminating in the appearance of the Serpents, a timeless race of semi-divine and <em>deeply</em> malevolent beings, as well as their benevolent counterparts. The last book essentially confirms that some sort of "higher power" is very real; exactly what the higher power <em>is</em>, though, is left ambiguous.

The Alerans treat several of the practices of their Roman ancestors with scorn, to the point that some people think the Romans couldn't have done them to begin with because they are just so self-evidently ludicrous. These customs include worshipping gods, attempting to predict the future by studying animal entrails, shaping stone and metal without magic, and building complex machines.

</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch">Imperial Radch</a></em> series, where the Radchaai empire is tremendously advanced and openly devout.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortStory">Short Story</a> "Angels and Aliens" by Jon R. Osborne, religion is far from dead, but <em>organized</em> religion is doing poorly: the protagonist is a Catholic priest who joins the Berzerkers mercenary company as a chaplain to find that much of the membership are neo-pagans (everything from Asatrus to Wiccans).
</li><li> Zigzagged in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> series and its spin-off series <em>Trevelyan's Mission</em>. The main series starts in the late 21st century, and this trope is decidedly averted there, with radical Islam and the related terrorism being rampant and the main reason for the creation of a unified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a> by the dominant global powers. Following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>, cults spring up, believing that the aliens were humanity's intended saviors and even those believing they were descended from those same aliens. The spin-off series takes place in the 29th century, and it's stated that, while a good number of humans still believe in various faiths, organized religion is pretty much gone due to the predominant view that a person's faith is a deeply personal thing that doesn't require a priest or a minister. Also averted with some alien races, such as the Kni'lina, who are at the same technological level of development as humanity, but one of their two main factions deeply believes in a prophet-like figure and treats him as divine. The other faction is highly pragmatic, but still views that figure with respect.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a></em>, where most religious beliefs have been supplanted by ancestor worship. In fact, every warship has a chapel located deep inside it, in the most protected part of the ship. Geary ends his every message with, "To the honor of our ancestors," which is apparently some sort of traditional formality that is rarely observed in modern times. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyRight">The Syndicate Worlds</a> play the trope a bit straighter; it's mentioned in passing in the first of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostStars">The Lost Stars</a></em> spinoff series that observance of the same ancestor-worship practices seen in the Alliance are officially frowned upon (probably because nobody could figure out how to exploit them for money or power) but not actually outlawed.
<ul><li> The prequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGenesisFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGenesisFleet">The Genesis Fleet</a></em> shows the beginnings of this belief as a cult that springs up in the recently-settled frontier colonies, as the settlers start looking back at Old Earth with a measure of nostalgia.

</li><li> In "The Ultimate Computer," the fact that Federation computer expert Dr. Daystrom — and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRobot">consequently, the sentient computer he has built</a> — believed in God<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2dul9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2dul9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2dul9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The machine says "Murder is contrary to the laws of man and God."</span> becomes a plot point. Kirk makes the computer realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in committing murder, it has committed a terrible sin. Out of remorse, it self-destructs.</span>
</li><li> In "Day of the Dove", Kirk tells Kang, "Go to the Devil!" Kang replies, "We [Klingons] have no Devil... but we are very familiar with the habits of yours." Cue use of torture. Years later, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Next Generation</a> then introduced a figure in Klingon religion named Fek'lhr in "The Devil's Due", who is described as their "Devil". However, he's really more akin to Cerberus from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, being a warden of their Hell.
</li><li> <em>The Next Generation</em> episode "Rightful Heir" deals with Kahless, the revered founder of the Klingon Empire and ancestor figure in Klingon history. There is a shrine of Klingon priests who await the return of Kahless — and who create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneJesus">clone of him</a> to "stabilize" the empire (to their advantage); however, once the clone learns his real nature, he turns out to be an honest sort who tries to fulfill his position as sort-of-but-not-really Kahless honorably (think less "second coming" and more "heir to his legacy"). Generally, the different Trek series treat the Klingons' faith in Kahless in a positive light.
</li><li> Of all the Trek series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> was by far the most overt about it, with Picard explicitly invoking this trope in speeches in "Encounter At Farpoint" and "Who Watches the Watchers?" Not coincidentally it was when Roddenberry fully controlled things.
<ul><li> The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a> atheistic <em>Star Trek</em> ever got was in the third season <em>TNG</em> episode "Who Watches the Watchers". A group of Federation scientists are using holographic technology to watch a primitive Vulcanoid culture that has apparently abandoned religion. The Federation equipment breaks down, revealing their existence and "magical powers" to the locals, one of whom declares they must be gods and tries to restart the Old Time Religions. Picard takes the leader up and explains to her that the Federation are merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, not gods. The episode then goes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a> mode, referring to humanity's religious era as "the dark ages of superstition and ignorance and fear." Afterwards, an away team goes down to the planet to explain how irrational it is to believe in gods, saying that they never show up or tell believers what they want, and that believers are left putting their faith in what other mortals tell them.
</li><li> Then again, in "Where Silence Has Lease", Data asks Picard about death. Picard gives a philosophical answer which shows that although he's not explicitly religious, and doesn't believe in a traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>, he also rejects the idea that death is the end, believing there must be something more, even if people may not have any idea of its exact nature. The way he speaks about the cosmic order of the universe indicates he may be at least deist or pantheist.
</li></ul></li><li> In "Déjà Q", Q has been turned into a human and sarcastically contemplates becoming a missionary. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Data</a> states that such a line of work would be admirable, implying that there are still humans who view religion positively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> is a seven-year mix of affirmations and denials of this trope. The station's commander was declared an alien Jesus in the first episode, later found alien gods to confirm it, then started having visions and became a god himself. Overall the series takes a balanced view: while several episodes (mostly dealing with recurring character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Winn Adami</a>) decry the <em>abuse</em> of religion as a political tool or an excuse to discriminate against others, the show as a whole doesn't condemn the practice of religion itself. Part of what makes it confusing is that the Prophets can back up everything their believers say about them; the first season finale had a dispute on whether they were technically gods or not fizzle out when everybody realized they were arguing over semantics and all agreed on the key points.
</li><li> Then there's the Klingons, whose mythology in this series says that the ancient Klingons <em>killed</em> their gods. The details vary: Worf says "They were more trouble than they were worth" when queried, while Lady Sirella relates a story of how the gods were killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">the heartbeats of the first Klingon couple when they met</a> (the tale is part of the traditional Klingon marriage rite).
</li><li> In the <em>DS9</em> episode "Penumbra," after Sisko proposes to Kasidy Yates, she mentions her mother would want them to be married by a minister.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a>'s</em> Commander Chakotay is the most visibly religious human protagonist in the entire franchise (even if the religion he practices is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">poorly researched mishmash</a> of Native American and New Age ideas), and the other characters are consistently very respectful of his beliefs. Notably, his is the only real voice of spiritual consolation to Neelix after Neelix suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a> in his alien religion in "Mortal Coil."
</li><li> "Mortal Coil" is one of the most thoughtful explorations of the idea in the franchise, albeit a very dark one. After Neelix has been medically declared dead, Seven of Nine is able to revive him via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">phlebotinum.</a> Neelix suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a> in his alien religion because he did not catch any glimpse of the afterlife. Chakotay tries to reassure him and lets him use a gizmo to go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">vision quest into his own psyche,</a> but this only upsets him more, despite Chakotay's insistance that he may be misinterpreting what he saw. Neelix finally finds the strength to keep going after speaking with little Naomi Wildman, but still ends the episode emotionally wounded and full of more questions than answers.
</li><li> In "Hunters," Tuvok receives a message from his family on Vulcan. His wife assures him they are praying for his safe return. At a temple.
</li><li> In "Dagger of the Mind", and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>, it is shown that they still celebrate Christmas and actually call it that, instead of the current contemporary habit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXMas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXMas">"Holiday Season"</a>. They don't, however, celebrate it with our modern commercial strain. It seems to consist instead of parties among friends.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, Phlox mentions that while on Earth, he sampled a number of Earth religions, visiting a Buddhist monastery and attending mass in St. Peter's Square. When asked about his own beliefs, Archer states that he prefers to keep an open mind. The episode "Cold Front" involves the crew playing host to a group of alien religious pilgrims, who are portrayed in a positive light. However, a later episode, "The Chosen Realm" deals with an alien race who worship the creators of the Delphic Expanse. Having examined the inside of one of the anomaly-creating spheres and discovering nothing more than extremely advanced technology, the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em> are understandably skeptical about this religion, but the episode is more about religious extremism than religion itself (the episode ends with the <em>Enterprise</em> finding the alien homeworld in ruins). However, the reveal that the two religious groups differ only in how many days it took to create the Delphic Expanse makes others see the conflict as ridiculous.
</li></ul></li><li> Some could see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> as one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against organized religion. The eponymous team spends at least half of the plot convincing primitive groups that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus">gods are fake and should forget about them</a>, even the ones with the characteristics of actual gods: they <em>are</em>, after all, merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">sufficiently advanced aliens</a> posing as gods, either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">snaky parasites</a> out to exploit humans or well-meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Little Gray Guys</a> trying to help.
<ul><li> With the Ori, things are more blurry: they actually qualify as gods according to one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> religion and would do so in most fantasy series, but writer intent evidently considers them false gods as well. After a few episodes of dealing with ridiculously headstrong groups, the team basically settles on "Just because they're powerful enough to claim godhood, doesn't mean you should <em>actually</em> worship them!"
</li><li> Many other episodes reference religion directly in subtle or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">not so subtle</a> ways, like "The Sentinel", where the Latonans refuse to evacuate in the face of an alien invasion, constantly referencing their "highest law".
</li><li> Things were handled a little differently in "Red Sky". A planet is doomed and the people refuse to leave as they think their death is the will of the gods (specifically the Asgard, although they don't know who they are specifically). While Jack is more than willing to destabilize their belief system, Daniel tells him that while the possible existence of their gods is not important, the belief <em>is</em>. At the end of the episode, the resolution is deliberately left unclear. It may be that the Asgard fixed the problem, but Daniel wonders if it's possible that a higher power did intervene.
</li><li> "Icon" featured an incident similar to the aforementioned <em>TNG</em> "Who Watches the Watchers". The arrival of SG-1 on the planet Tegalus causes a Goa'uld-worshiping extremist faction to gain in popularity, eventually starting a civil war that aggravates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar">cold war</a>. Difference is, the SGC views it as a purely military/political problem that's keeping them from rescuing Daniel, who was trapped on Tegalus by the war.
</li><li> Slightly different from the norm, the episode "Demons" features a planet of Christian-ish people where the Goa'uld in question is pretending to be Satan rather than God, with Unas as his demons, but despite Teal'c mentioning that he does not believe any Goa'uld is capable of the "kindness expressed in your Bible", the plot goes largely as standard. The villagers are firmly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">The Dung Ages</a> and still practice trepanning, the priest is a pompous jackass who exploits their fear to keep his power, and they refuse to accept SG-1's help, imprisoning them and putting Teal'c through deadly "witch trials" (though they went for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">more historically accurate Drown The Witch</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a>). A villager in the end even stands up to the Unas with only his faith to protect him, declaring that "My God is with me, always." In the end, the one villager who believed SG-1 killed the Unas, and they no longer believe it's a demon.
</li><li> Interestingly, one episode linked Buddhism to an alien philosophy about seeking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascension</a>. As Ascension was later confirmed to be a very real thing, this actually gave Buddhism some credence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> has plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> moments against religion:
<ul><li> In "Poisoning the Well", the scientific search for a Wraith immunity drug has become a religion, with libraries of knowledge as a church analogue and a famous scientist's lab notes are a sort of holy text. The real clincher is the population's eagerness to take the unsafe product, even when they know exactly how unsafe it is.
</li><li> In "Sanctuary", they find an incredibly primitive world untouched by the Wraith, whose inhabitants lead idyllic lives, all of which they attribute to their goddess, Athar. Said goddess, it turns out, is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended being</a> that takes mortal form to serve as Athar's high priestess. McKay is a definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> over it, and gets some flak over it. Chaya however isn't bothered by it at all. When Sheppard apologizes for McKay's behaviour, she points out that McKay is simply acting according to his beliefs, making him no different from her people who act according to theirs.
</li><li> Subverted in "The Tower". A local is hesitant to take McKay to some caverns saying it isn't safe. McKay states that he doesn't care about their "primitive taboos" and says the caves are safe, only for the local to say it's the very real danger of <em>earthquakes</em> that make the caves unsafe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> features a religious character whose faith was a plot point and treated positively. Many fans on the official forum cried <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>.
</li><li> The morality of the god or gods in question and the situation seems to be the most important thing. The various teams don't really go out of their way to dissuade the belief of a given population <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficently Advanced Aliens</a> are gods if they are benevolent such as with the Asgard and the belief is harmless. However, if like with the Ori and Goa'uld the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> are posing as gods in order to exploit the populace and/or the belief causes the people to do harmful things like in Icon and Red Sky above they try to shake them out of it. Whether "gods" deserve reverence and worship is a strong theme of the franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone (1959)</a></em>: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZoneS2E65TheObsoleteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheTwilightZoneS2E65TheObsoleteMan">The Obsolete Man</a>" was set in a future society where religion had been outlawed. Only one man still believed in God, and he was sentenced to death for being obsolete. He was allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChoosingDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChoosingDeath">choose how he died</a>; he chose to be bombed on live television. The high official who sentenced him to death came to his cell to speak with him, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInAFreezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInAFreezer">the door to lock behind him.</a> He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">panicked and shouted, "In the name of God, let me out!" The condemned man did — in the name of God. In the final scene, the official is sentenced to death for being obsolete.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has a big case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> in regards to this trope. The setting as a whole is inconsistent; sometimes religion is prominent even in "advanced" societies, other times it's absent, obsolete, or discredited. The Doctor himself, one of the oldest, most intelligent, and best-traveled beings in the universe, has never been portrayed as religious himself; he's just as inconsistent, sometimes being respectful of religions and their leaders and other times dismissing them. Many plots from the original series involved the Doctor saving people from worshiping a dangerous "god" who turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">advanced technology</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a>, or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.
<ul><li> The Doctor shows particular respect to Buddhism in "The Abominable Snowman"; he bows to the wisdom of a Buddhist priest, returns to them a sacred item, and uses Buddhist prayer to help Victoria resist the Great Intelligence. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> book <em>Eye of Heaven</em> has the Fourth Doctor recount the unshown adventure leading up to "The Abominable Snowman", claiming that his life had been saved by Buddhist faith healing performed on him by the priest, and using "Buddhist wisdom" to put himself into a "healing coma" that allowed him to recover from being shot through the heart.
</li><li> In "Planet of the Spiders", the eponymous villains worship the Great One as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Empress</a> and use their religion to exploit and brutalize the enslaved humans on their planet. By contrast, the Third Doctor engages in Buddhist philosophy again, and a fellow Time Lord is a Buddhist priest.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor period is the most visible user of the trope; he frequently mocked mysticism and magic of all sorts, and his tenure featured the highest proportion of "the Doctor fights religion" plots. His companion Leela was even designed to contrast her savagery and superstition against the Doctor's pacifism and scientific knowledge, with their first scene in "The Robots of Death" having the Doctor explicitly tell Leela that magic doesn't exist. Leela had already begun to question her original faith in "The Face of Evil"; in her first scene in the series she's taunting her own high priest, shouting <em>"Liar! There is no Xoannon!!"</em>
<ul><li> On the other hand, the story arcs featuring the White and Black Guardians — who, at least metaphorically, clearly represented God and the Devil and weren't at all subtle about it — began during the 4th Doctor years and continued into the 5th Doctor's era.
</li></ul></li><li> Implied in "The Ark in Space", where Vira, a far future human with quite an alien mindset, immediately explains to the Doctor and his companions that the Ark leader's nickname Noah was taken from "mythology", as if expecting them not to know.
</li><li> The Fifth Doctor episode "Kinda" is, again, full of Buddhist symbolism.
</li><li> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> in the first four seasons of the reboot series, which had little to no mention of magic or religion. Showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> was a staunch atheist, found it utterly implausible for the Doctor or any of his advanced alien cohorts to be religious, and declared, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">That's what I believe, so that's what you're going to get</a>. Tough, really. To get rid of those so-called agendas, you've got to get rid of me." The heartbreaking rendition of "The Old Rugged Cross" in "Gridlock" notwithstanding, apparently.
</li><li> Davies was followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, who threw both sides of religion back into the mix. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> of series 5 and 6 were an intergalactic religious order who manipulate people through post-hypnotic commands, and religion and the military became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">practically the same thing</a> in the future. Series 7 reveals that the previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>, though, were a splinter faction from what's essentially Space Catholicism; the Doctor gets along quite well with the "chief Priestess of the Galactic Papal Mainframe".
</li><li> The Tenth Doctor more or less says in "The Satan Pit" that he doesn't believe in God or any sort of higher power, or at least he's never run across anything to convince him that such a power exists. Given that he's run into various super-powerful "god"-like beings, such as Sutekh, Fenric, and the White and Black Guardians, that's quite a statement.
</li><li> One of the Doctor's nicknames in the reboot era is "the lonely god". There's nobody on his level anymore, not even the other Time Lords, much less anything higher that he recognizes. The responsibility of it wears him down.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor is actually open to the idea of an afterlife (and mentions he always meant to take a look), but he finds the version presented in "Dark Water" to be absolutely ludicrous. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's right; it's a ploy by Missy to freak out the world's rich and powerful for the purposes of creating an army of the dead. She did end up creating a virtual afterlife in the process, though</span>.
</li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor is shown to be very respectful of religions, even participating in a few minor but important prayers. The Doctor is mentioned in something called "the Book of Celebrants," and she apologizes for her ignorance when she mistook some time-traveling priests for murderers (they show up whenever someone dies alone to pray with them).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> takes an interesting perspective on religion for a sci-fi show. Although it doesn't discuss religion extraordinarily often, several crew members practice various alien religions, and some of them are quite devout. The show also demonstrates that gods and magic really do exist in their universe, some more than others. The Peacekeepers, on the other hand, play this trope straight, with an entire episode, "Prayer", devoted to Aeryn recounting the ancient legend of a Sebacean goddess (implying that they no longer believe in gods in the present day) and praying to her for rescue; for added desperation points, Aeryn notes that the reason this particular goddess doesn't have any followers anymore is because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">killed them all on a whim</a>.
</li><li> A sketch on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall">The Kids in the Hall</a></em> featured a futuristic society that celebrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">Bellini Day</a>, in which the characters referred to a time period where mankind was so stupid they actually believed in someone named God.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>
<ul><li> Creator J. Michael Straczynski, an atheist himself, deliberately avoided this trope in the series (in contrast with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>), with all the major species having beliefs of various kinds and strengths, and a mix of believers and non-believers. The straightest example is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Lorien</a>, who says his people have lived so long they simply had no more use for such things. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveTheLostTales01" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveTheLostTales01">The Lost Tales</a>", mention is made of how religion has been declining since humanity went to space and made contact with other races, but it still has a considerable presence in Earth-influenced space and among the alien races. The Catholic Church is alive and well; over the course of the series Babylon 5 becomes home to a small but thriving Dominican community who mostly concern themselves with comparative religious studies. Babylon 5 is also chosen to host an ecumenical conference at one point (involving Catholics, a Baptist church complete with gospel choir and a delegation from the Church of Elvis). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> orders of monks also preserve humans' knowledge after nuclear war wipes out civilization, much like monasteries did during the Dark Ages.</span> Humanity's main distinction is just <em>how many</em> extant religions there are; in an event where all the ambassadors were displaying their cultures' dominant faiths, the Human exhibition was just a long line of people who all had different beliefs.
</li><li> Among the human main characters: Sinclair is a Catholic, and was instructed by Jesuits as an adolescent. Ivanova is originally a lapsed Jew, but reconnects with her faith in the first season. Franklin is a Foundationist, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaithSmoothie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaithSmoothie">syncretic future religion</a> which holds that all the galaxy's existing faiths reflect some part of a greater truth (rather like real-life Unitarian Universalists). Garibaldi is agnostic but was raised Catholic. Zack Allen's religion is unknown, but he believes in Heaven. Sheridan doesn't follow an organised religion, describing his beliefs as "eclectic". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To further muddle things, Sheridan himself becomes something of a messianic figure after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">coming back from the dead</a>.</span>
</li><li> Among the aliens:
<ul><li> Narns like G'Kar follow the teachings of a variety of gurus. G'Kar is a follower of G'Quan, and apparently has some prominence among them. He is shown reading religious texts, leading ceremonies and, at one point, writing a religious text of his own.
</li><li> Londo makes several references to various Centauri deities, including some dead Emperors. He owns several statuettes of various deities, and while he doesn't seem to be overly religious he pays at least lip service to his people's gods.
</li><li> Delenn and Lennier are prominent members of the Minbari Religious caste, though Minbari religion makes little outright reference to gods and seems more focused on personal enlightenment. That said, they do revere a sort of messianic figure in their history named Valen, and often swear in Valen's name, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is really interesting once we learn that Valen is Delenn's friend and former B5 station commander, Jeffrey Sinclair, a human sent back in time a thousand years to lead the Minbari in their time of need.</span>
</li><li> There is also a random Pak'ma'ra who makes reference to a religious text to explain why Pak'ma'ra eat carrion but refuse seafood.
</li></ul></li><li> The portrayals aren't always positive; the deeply religious Markab race die out in their entirety because they cling to their beliefs rather than embracing science, and a young alien boy is killed by his parents in season 1, because they believe a simple surgical procedure (to remove a pulmonary cyst that is slowly choking him to death) has turned their child into a soulless monster.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> the only one of the main characters who shows the slightest religious belief is the robot hard-wired to believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotReligion">Silicon Heaven</a>. Though Rimmer mentions that his parents were "Seventh Day Hoppists" (their Bible had a typo) and implies that their religious lunacy is responsible for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist">Hollywood Atheist</a> tendencies.
<ul><li> The Cat's species developed a religion worshiping Lister, who wasn't particularly happy about the wars they had in his name. Though the Cat himself proclaims that he doesn't believe any of that stuff.
</li><li> In one episode a newscast announces that the Bible's dedication page and "work of fiction" disclaimer was discovered.
</li><li> Christianity is disproved again in the episode, <em>Lemons</em>. Rimmer says his mother belonged to a religious sect that believed Jesus and Judas were identical twin brothers, with Judas pretending to be a resurrected Jesus after Jesus died. Time travel confirms this to be true.
</li><li> <em>Lemons</em> also implies that people in the future see Christianity as a bad thing due to all the wars it started. The only reason the dwarfers don't use time travel to stop it is that there would be no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a></em> Christmas specials if there was no Christianity. A time travelling Jesus also comes to the same conclusion about Christianity starting wars after reading through a future encyclopedia.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> has never made it a secret about how he views religion (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> below). Add the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> flavor of humanism, and it's no shock that this trope is heavily in play.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a> in regards to the Krill, as unlike most advanced civilizations, they have <em>increased</em> in religiosity rather than decreasing. Their religion teaches that other species are soulless abominations lacking in true intelligence and sentience, more akin to animals than people, going so far as to use captive humans as sacrifices. Later they explain that species have been observed as having two reactions to finding other life and going into space. One is becoming humble, and no longer thinking they were the center of the universe. The other is doubling down, becoming very xenophobic. Obviously the Krill did that. Ed mentions before they were more peaceful, and it's possible also had a more passive interpretation of their religion.
</li><li> Seems to be the way for society in general as by the 29th century, where "You can go to hell" is a complete <em>non sequitur</em>.
</li><li> The Chief Engineer still exclaims "Oh my God" after a crewmember is badly hurt. Alara also uses this phrase, and she is an alien. Of course, for most even now that's just an expression.
</li><li> The society influenced by Kelly during its Bronze Age eventually grows out of religious fundamentalism and embraces reason.
</li><li> Humans appear to no longer have believers in astrology, as when dealing with the Regorians (with a belief system that's entirely based on it) some must have the basic <em>concept</em> explained. They also hope that, due to their efforts, the Regorians will outgrow their belief too (which is basically the religion there).
</li><li> However in the episode "If the Stars Should Appear" Ed says Hi, I'm Captain Ed Mercer of the Jehovah's Witnesses. As a joke. Even though its a joke it could imply that the Witnesses still exist so humanity might not have completely outgrown religion. It's likely however that he was just referencing the past for the joke.
</li></ul></li><li> Used to portray the future dystopia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>. In "Pressure Point", Blake has to explain to Gan what a church is as "The Federation had them all destroyed at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearZero">beginning of the New Calendar</a>." While the Clonemasters have pseudo-religous trappings, they are a creation of the Federation used to keep control of their forbidden knowledge. In "Cygnus Alpha", the cult leaders use a phony religion to keep their society united on a penal planet with limited resources. Other than these examples however the trope is played straight, as we don't see anyone turning to religious belief to cope with their existence in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>. Neither does the Federation use a state religion as a tool of power, which they'd certainly do if religious beliefs had any currency among the population.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em>: Mond and the Director muse that John is in (silent) prayer over his mother's body, and it's made clear they're among only a few New Londoners who still even know what this means. To drive home the point, Mond comments that "there was once a thing called 'God'", confirming they no longer have this belief..

Not only is religion still around in the future, but it might be more important to humanity than it is now. Of course, the religions of Earth have greatly reformed.
<ul><li> Haqqislam is following a version of Islam that embraces progress with numerous Christian and Jewish minorities living in its realms. Jerusalem is still a holy site for the Abrahamic faiths.
</li><li> The nation Panoceania is influenced by the Vatican and can field advanced futuristic crusaders.
</li><li> Yu Jing had the Chinese Communist Party decided to embrace forms of East Asian spirituality in its expansion.

Presumably, the very real and somewhat provable existence of the old ones made everyone less interested in religions that have a very specific world view that excludes them.

<ul><li> The Tau seem to exhibit divine worship of their Ethereals, but that is more obeisance to their leaders than religion; they otherwise have no belief in anything "magical" or "supernatural", including the very real daemons and other things that inhabit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the warp</a>. As a race with no psychers and whose souls barely touch the warp, in practical terms thinking of daemons as just another hostile alien race is true enough for practical purposes. They are by far the most socially and technologically progressive faction in the setting, which admittedly isn't saying much.
</li><li> The Eldar believe in the existence of their gods and invoke the power of one (Khaine) on a semi-regular basis, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">they don't worship them</a>; they mostly just use them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods">Oh My Gods!</a>. This is because all but three of their gods were <em>eaten</em> by a Chaos god, and there is no real point to much of their religion anymore (except for Cegorach the Laughing God, but only the Harlequins worship him).
</li><li> The Immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of Mankind <em>tried</em> to invoke this, creating a society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat Earth Atheists</a> because he thought it would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">starve the Chaos gods</a> (which was not only unlikely to work, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">as the Chaos Gods don't need worship</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">backfired</a> because while people were channeling their emotions to those religions, they were denying them to the Chaos Gods). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Being 40K</a>, it failed miserably and made everything worse.

The most common is Neo-Buddhism, Buddhism combined with Transhumanism, where uploading is seen as a form of reincarnation and the emphasis is on lessening suffering rather than escaping it. Oddly, Islam was able to adapt to uploading, but the other Abrahamic faiths largely couldn't. The Catholic church is also still influential in the Jovian Junta, with its large population that managed to escape Earth in their original bodies.

Unfortunately, the faith's founders realized and feared, but were powerless to stop the eventual corruption of that ideal into the Word of Blake.

All of the Clans have some sort of reverence, sometimes bordering on worship, for Alexander and Nicholas Kerensky, and Clans Coyote, Cloud Cobra, Goliath Scorpion and Nova Cat all have some sort of spirituality aspect to their practices. Further, the Clans, even the more hard-edged atheist ones, are not shown to be morally or intellectually superior to the Inner Sphere.

As a result, the territories of the UPL/UED are non-religious, while the Koprulu Sector is teeming with religious groups, ranging from mainstream Christianity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a> and to even stranger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Cults</a> and movements.

Religions still existed to some extent, but their few serious adherents were considered delusional at best and dangerous fanatics at worst. That is, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">Kharak was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">bombed into oblivion</a>; afterwards the survivors experienced a slight resurgence of religious belief, such as the members of Kiith Somtaaw (formerly a minor religious faction before they turned to mining full-time) in <em>Cataclysm</em>.

Then the descendants of the other side snapped during the war and tried to form a third faction. It turns out that the main elements are actually true, although mistakenly ascribed to a god rather than a rival star empire.

<ul><li> Humans as a whole still follow lots of religions, but space-faring humans to a lesser degree. Ashley implies that she's seen as eccentric for having a religious belief.
</li><li> The hanar worship the very real (though long-extinct) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Protheans</a>.
</li><li> The Drell are deeply religious. Thane Krios mentions several Drell gods, including Amonkira, Lord of Hunters, and Arashu, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection. If his son is saved in the second game, he undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">HeelFaith Turn</a> in the third game to become a priest.
</li><li> The most popular <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">asari</span> religion is revealed to be entirely based upon contact with Protheans by their primitive ancestors, heavily implying that ancient religions may be the direct result of alien contact, misconstrued or misremembered by the populations they affected.
</li><li> The turians believe in a form of pantheistic animism, but they're open to experimentation; some turians have been shown adopting Earth religions that mesh well with their worldview, including Zen Buddhism and Confucianism.
</li><li> The quarians dont believe in gods, but they believe in souls and hold their ancestors in a reverence which sometimes enters into ancestor worship (or was implied to have happened in the past). They in turn are held in near-religious reverence by the robotic Geth race they created, which is made fairly awkward by the way their mutual history includes multiple attempts to wipe each other out (originally triggered by a Geth asking "Does this unit have a soul?") A splinter Geth faction worship the Reapers instead, as a pinnacle of machine existence; the Reapers (who suffer species-wide denial that they <em>are</em> machines) find this insulting.
</li><li> Like the quarians, the krogan also have a form of ancestor worship. They also believe in a place they call the void where the souls of dead krogan go.
</li><li> The salarian religion is said to be similar to Hinduism. It has a "wheel of life" perspective, where the dead are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> to fix the flaws of their previous lives and become better people.
</li><li> Javik implies that the Protheans themselves practiced this trope, though he also mentions that this view was reconsidered after encountering the Reapers. It must be noted that he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>; he grew up in the Prothean Empire after the Reapers had invaded, and he's also, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Javik</a>.

Cartman awakens in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist">Hollywood Atheist</a> future where atheism has replaced religion. Religious factionalism and conflict have been replaced with various equally fanatical atheist factionalism and conflict. People shout things like "Hail science!", "science dammit", and "Science H. Logic!" instead of their religious equivalents. Ultimately, the episode is about how atheists are just as susceptible to stupidity as the followers of any religion. Especially since the whole reason the atheists split off into several factions and started fighting each other in the first place was because <em>they couldn't agree on what name to call themselves</em>.

</li><li> Similarly, one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> is set in 2045, with the present referred to as "when people still believed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>."

<ul><li> It was first attempted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">revolutionary France</a>.
<ul><li> Since the Catholic Church was widely corrupt before the Revolution and the largest landowner in France, a clash between them and Revolutionary forces was inevitable, beginning with the Civic Constitution of Clergy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note96u0c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note96u0c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note96u0c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A highly unpopular attempt to nationalize the French Church by requesting that French priests swear to the State, become public servants and abjure the Pope.</span> and persisting with Dechristianization, which sought to replace and convert Catholic iconography with non-religious ideas which ultimately resulted in vandalism of churches, monasteries and graveyards. Cemeteries were defaced with "Death is an Eternal Sleep", priests and nuns were targeted and censured and often guillotined, and popular Republican movements such as the Cult of Reason, preaching the perfection of humanity through reason, and replaced busts of Jesus with busts of revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat, while the statue of the Roman goddess Liberty was installed in the Notre Dame.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note103v1j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note103v1j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note103v1j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was not intended literally, but as a symbol of Liberty itself.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> opposed Dechristianization, but since the Catholic Church was involved in the counter-revolution, he compromised by replacing the Cult of Reason with the Cult of the Supreme Being, hoping to win over religious sentiments by transmuting it to deist Republicanism. His Festival of the Supreme Being was a huge popular success but a political suicide, and with his downfall it ended. Ten years later Napoleon Bonaparte brought back the Church to its prior position via his concordat after becoming Emperor.
</li><li> You can see some of the influence of the anticlerical forces in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSongOfBernadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSongOfBernadette">The Song of Bernadette</a></em>. This took place in 1858, and the French Emperor is shown declaring that an atheist is "the most stupid thing a sovereign could be", but the church is still plenty worried about anti-Catholic officials and journalists who try to use Bernadette's visions to stir up public antagonism toward the Church.
</li></ul></li><li> Karl Marx himself disagreed with this trope. He castigated atheist activists of Germany, such as the Young Hegelians, for focusing exclusively on religion as the main problem of contemporary society and the key stumbling block of progress. Marx regarded income inequality as the key reason why religion had appeal, and he noted that it continued in many capitalist and developed nations such as the United States. The famous quote of his usually neglects the sentence which follows: <em>The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.</em> i.e. as poverty and income inequality reduces, religious belief will likewise decline and religion is just one part of the general ideology of state capitalism. A fine print that communist nations neglected. The idea may have <em>some</em> merit, since wealthier countries have grown less religious over time, although that may not be the cause (or just one among many).
<ul><li> Though, it could be argued that the income inequality-religion dynamic is due to a "Whistling past the graveyard" effect that wealth produces. In short: the more wealthy you are, the more said wealth provides a kind of buffer between yourself and the vast existential questions/dread that plague the human condition. Those who on the other hand do not have the buffering effect of wealth turn to religion instead. Tellingly, in developed countries, many people are not necessarily irreligious in terms of not believing in God/other, but in the sense that they do not even think about religion at all or at least only a little bit (putting them closer to agnostics or apatheists instead). This is not incompatible with the above as one factor in religious decline.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course communist nations tried to invoke this in a very repressive manner. In practice, Communist nations often found themselves having to appeal to some form of traditional symbolism and usually compromised by creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> revolving around leaders made into something akin to saints and prophets.
<ul><li> The Soviet Union tried multiple times to invoke this trope through anti-religious campaigns which included propaganda, secular education, and mass executions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> for his part promoted atheism in education and privately but he struck a balance by mostly targeting the Orthodox Church which was seen, not without cause, as oppressive to minority religions in the Russian Empire and highly reactionary. Lenin enacted laws helping or respecting Jews, Muslims and Old Believers while he persecuted the Orthodox Church. This reversed under Stalin who initially targeted all religions, including minority beliefs, and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> he halted the persecution of the Orthodox Church and allowed it to revive in a big way after the war, until Khruschev mounted a fresh anti-religious campaign. After him it was mostly relaxed once more.
</li></ul></li><li> The current status of this trope varies around the world. In many Western countries, the religiosity of younger generations is declining; irreligion of some kind is now the second-largest "religious" affiliation in the United States; poorer countries, by contrast, see a decline of atheism in the future. Given that fog clouds the future, it remains to be seen whether this plays out.
