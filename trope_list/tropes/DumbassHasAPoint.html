<ul><li> Shiro Kabuto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> was The Hero Kouji's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>. Although sometimes he seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> cause some stunts he pulled, he had good points from time to time. Boss also has a point more frequently than you'd expect. I.e., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent">when Kouji refuses to help Sayaka after they have a fight</a> and she takes off in Mazinger Z, Boss, Mucha and Nuke are the ones who urge him to stop whining and go for her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Genma is not known for his brilliance when it comes to schemes, plots or ploys. In fact, it's usually quite the opposite. Keep in mind that this is the man who hauled himself and his son to a cursed training ground simply on the basis that he figured "cursed = dangerous = great place to train!" and who was stupid enough to buy into and teach his son the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Neko Ken</a>. And yet, despite all this, Ranma is still perfectly willing to ask Genma for advice, because every so often, Genma says something that is either genuinely profound, or it's so stupid/off-kilter it actually becomes useful. This is played up a bit more in the anime — for example, it's Genma's comment about "looking with your gut" that lets Ranma see through Cologne's Splitting Cat Hairs technique, and it's also in the anime that Genma explicitly tells Ranma that he lost while fighting in female form because he doesn't play to that form's strengths. It's actually a fairly common thread among several of the characters. No matter how how stupid a character might otherwise be, they are still skilled martial artists. While Genma gets this role most often, Happōsai will very rarely stop being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> to actually be useful. Not for nothing is he the most powerful character on the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">apart from the fact that he can be effectively vanquished by a bra</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> deals with this in the form of Team Rocket in "A Lean Mean Team Rocket Machine". Jessie decides that Team Rocket should get back in shape. Her teammates, James and Meowth, remarked in unison, "Weird when she makes sense." As a side note, though, Jessie isn't stupid, and James is usually the team member who comes off as slightly less intelligent than his friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, since most of the team are idiots (especially Taki). From rival team, Ootawara of Ojou White Knights is <em>made</em> for this trope.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Mihoshi</a> suggests that Mayuka is from the future. The rest of the cast begins to dismiss this idea until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Washu</a> confirms that she's correct. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in that Mayuka was actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> designed to <em>appear</em> to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>: Natsumi agrees with Sarge on his directive that they should give the house a nice deep clean for New Year's. "And when I say I hate to say it, I mean it actually causes me intense physical pain."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: During the Alabasta arc, Luffy points out to Vivi that simply beating up Crocodile would be the best thing to do, instead of trying to stop the rebels from fighting (which would cost many more lives). Often times, Luffy knows that beating up the biggest bad guy solves the problem faster. He did this as well in Enies Lobby, zeroing in on Lucci, the strongest member of CP9 and the biggest threat.
<ul><li> He also mentions that people <em>will</em> die no matter what Vivi does, a surprisingly realistic observation for him that the other crew members don't contest.
</li><li> At the beginning of the series, soon after gaining the <em>Going Merry,</em> they save Zoro's old friend Yosaku who was suffering scurvy. When Nami notes that they need someone who knows their way around food, Luffy immediately jumps to the realization they need a <em>cook</em>, an idea so sensible everyone agrees with him (unusual for Luffy), setting up the Baratie Arc and the eventual recruitment of Sanji.
</li><li> In Water 7, upon learning the <em>Going Merry</em> was on her last legs, Luffy made the tough call to seek out a new ship. Usopp disagreed to the point of abandoning the crew and challenging Luffy one-on-one for ownership of the <em>Merry</em>. Luffy chose to go through with it, and when Nami asked why he isn't trying to stop it, Luffy pointed out that he knew Usopp was dead serious about it and wouldn't be convinced any other way. Despite her misgivings, she didn't argue with him anymore.
</li><li> While Zoro's not stupid per se, he does often come off as not much smarter than Luffy because he makes reckless decisions on a whim. However, he was the one crewmate who opposed Usopp's rejoining into the crew, on the grounds that he disrespected Luffy. Though he constantly belittles Luffy, he notes that if a crew can't respect its captain (or if the captain doesn't deserve their respect), they're not fit to be a crew. Even Sanji, who normally mocks or disagrees with what Zoro says, agreed with him. To Luffy's credit (a guy who normally does his own thing on a whim), he got the point and agreed, too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And it worked. Realizing he really did run the risk of being abandoned, Usopp finally came clean and apologized.</span>
</li><li> Sanji has a reaction to this effect when Zoro comes up with a two-layered identifying system to help them tell whether someone is Mr. 2 in disguise. Specifically, the members of the crew wear a bandage around their arms, a conspicuous identifying mark that hides the <em>actual</em> mark- an X painted onto their skin. Since Mr. 2 can't see the X, he won't be able to mimic it, something that helps save Vivi from falling prey to Mr. 2 when he disguises himself as Usopp.
</li><li> While infiltrating Big Mom's home island, Nami freaks out when a giant crocodile in human clothes speaks to them and walks away. Luffy points out they have seen weird things like that before, pointing to their present company Chopper, a half-human reindeer, and Carrot, a literal bunny-girl.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>, Barnaby expresses shock upon the discovery that he and Kotetsu actually <em>agree</em> on something ("We didn't become heroes because we want praise and appreciation.")
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Kakashi Gaiden arc, when Rin is captured, the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">then</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> Kakashi suggests that the enemy will make use of Rin's medic-nin skills to heal their wounded (as an argument against going to save her), while Obito, who is not very bright by comparison suggests that the enemy won't think to use her that way and will interrogate her for information on their mission (as an argument for going to save her). Obito turns out to be right.
</li><li> During the second stage of the Chunin Exam, Team 7 are attacked by Orochimaru, disguised as another examinee. Seeing how outclassed they are, Sasuke moves to give Orochimaru his scroll (The teams that have a Heaven and Earth scroll pass, and Orochimaru had the other one), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Naruto</a> stops him, pointing out that there's no guarantee that someone so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> will just be satisfied with a scroll. Orochimaru admits this, as his real goal was infecting Sasuke with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">his curse mark.</a>
</li><li> In the Konoha 11 filler arc, Naruto and Choji, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">two of the less intelligent members of the team</a>, suggest that the old man who turned out to be infiltrating the village was not a bad person because he likes ramen. It turns out that he had, because of his friendship with Naruto, replaced all the explosive paper tags with harmless ones to make it a scavenger hunt like he had enjoyed with his son.

Harry quickly counters that the spirit has superior power and ability in this confrontation. There is no logical reason to halt the attack for even a moment to end the life of a potentially dangerous enemy unless the spirit felt Harry being alive would be better off for the spirit, ergo the spirit has some self-interest. The spirit considers the argument and notes he will think on it later when his "attention is not otherwise occupied by mildly effective stalling tactics."

Of course, this is not helped by Joffrey's inclination towards ridiculing, humiliating, and dominating those around him, even to people where it's not wise to do so, especially his grandfather.
<ul><li> Season One: He points out how counter-productive a feudal system is towards maintaining a strong, centralized state and suggests forming a nationalized military loyal to the state itself. While a fair observation in itself (given that it's the reason half the country currently wants to kill him), his solutions towards implementing such a system are less well-thought out.
</li><li> Season Two: He points out that with the Greyjoys tearing at Robb Stark's flank, an attack by the Lannisters would wipe them out. He's right, but he's also forgetting the <em>small</em> fact that Stannis Baratheon is about to hit King's Landing very much the way a sledgehammer hits an egg.

<ul><li> Michael Scott generally comes up with incredibly stupid and self-centered ideas and observations, to the point where one of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">running gags</a> is to have Michael try to explain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> of the episode, only to completely miss the mark. However, there are times when he is genuinely right, such as when he correctly deduces that a new "restructure" of the chain of command is an attempt by David Wallace to not have to interact with Michael so often.
<div class="indent"><strong>Michael:</strong> I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that. <br/><strong>Wallace:</strong> <em>[a little stunned]</em> Yeah. You're right. Yes.
</div></li><li> Probably his crowning moment in the entire series came later when negotiating with Wallace over the sale of the Michael Scott Paper Company. He first turns down the cash offer (reasonably asserting that they need stable jobs rather than a lump sum) and then correctly plays on Wallace's fears regarding his own position as CFO.
<div class="indent"><strong>Michael:</strong> I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
</div></li><li> He also correctly surmised another time that Darryl, the leader of the warehouse employees, was using an incident where Roy attacked Jim as leverage to get a pay raise.
</li><li> "Did I Stutter?" features Stanley, having suffered through Michael's foolishness for years, finally blowing up at a meeting and telling Michael to leave him alone in a furious tone. Later on, Michael attempts a poorly thought-out lesson by pretending to fire Stanley. Stanley, angered by this, proceeds to go on a rant where he insults Michael by calling him a "professional idiot", causing Michael to snap and order everyone out except Stanley. The subsequent conversation features a rare moment of professional insight from Michael - while Stanley might not respect Michael as a person, he <em>cannot</em> talk like that to a superior in the office. Stanley admits that he has has a point and the two shake hands.
</li><li> "Shareholder Meeting" has Dunder Mifflin's CEO Chris O'Keefe get fed up with Michael's bizarre behavior and call him a moron. Michael takes offense and points out that, not only is his branch is the only one in the company that's actually making money, he's also the only one present who's at least trying to come up with solutions to avoid bankruptcy instead of splurging on things like limos and fancy hotel rooms for meetings while doing nothing. If anything, O'Keefe and the other executives are the morons.
</li><li> "Secretary's Day" features Andy lashing out at Michael because he mentioned to Erin, whom Andy has started dating, that Andy and Angela used to be engaged. Michael rightfully points out that not only did he not know Andy was keeping it a secret, but that Andy should've been upfront with her about it. Since Angela works four feet from her, she was bound to find out eventually.
</li><li> "Business School" has Ryan bring Michael as a speaker to his MBA class. After getting into a heated back and forth with the students over Dunder-Mifflin's future and learning Ryan had actually criticized the company, Michael tells the students that the things they're learning in the classroom don't necessarily translate to a real business environment. Case in point, Ryan, for everything he's learned in class, has never made a single sale at Dunder-Mifflin.

Cat responds: "You know I'd rather wear sideways-pressed flares and a clip-on polyester tie than agree with Goalpost-Head... but this time he's right." Sure enough, when Lister ignores him, their mistakes end up radically altering human history, and to top it all off Lister forgets the curries.

A famous example of this lies in the Season 7 finale "A Shit River Runs Through It" where he and Juilian and Bubbles get stuck in a river and are cornered by two parties: a collaboration of the FBI, DEA and ATF on the US side, and forest rangers and Jim Lahey on the Canadian side. Ricky tells both groups that unless the boys choose a side, neither party has the right to arrest them.

Honda is a Japanese sumo wrestler who has set out into the world to fight against other martial artists and garner greater respect for sumo outside of Japan. However to do this he had to invent totally unique moves to use against the other fighters, and many of his techniques and self-imposed "rules" (such as jumping, headbutting, and his willingness to fight outside the traditional sumo ring) would be outright illegal in any formal sumo match. How can he possibly champion sumo wrestling as a legitimate martial art when in order to win street fights he has to devise and improvise his style to such an extent that no traditionalist sumo wrestler would ever recognise it? In other words, his attempts to prove that sumo wrestling is a fighting style have only succeeded in proving <em>that it really isn't</em>.

In general, Thog actually seems to have one of the more optimized builds in the comic: unlike Roy, who went straight Fighter, Thog dipped it for two levels (even picking up a rather useful alternate class feature) and then spent the rest of his time leveling as a Barbarian.

<ul><li> During season 2, the title character finds out that he has breast cancer and the drugs he takes for it are fake. He then goes on a rampage to find the source of the fake drugs, which turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIrishMob">The Irish Mob</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">straight woman Lana</a> asks if the whole affair is really worth it, Archer points out that although it is a personal mission for him, the gangsters are still selling fake cancer medicine, which is pretty heinous.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lana:</strong> Still though, you really want to take on the Irish mob? <br/><strong>Archer:</strong> No, I don't, but they're the ones switching out lifesaving cancer drugs with candy and Zima.
</div></li><li> Archer has claimed in a few episodes that he needs to "taper off" his alcohol use. Even though he's usually using it as an excuse to keep drinking, this is a real phenomenon; stopping cold on your drinking is not a good idea.
</li><li> The episode "Skytanic" has Archer being very derisive towards the concept of a luxury airship. He's acting like a jackass, and his fears of the airship going down like the Hindenberg are inaccurate (it's a helium ship), but he points out that the whole operation is probably doomed to bankruptcy anyway, since the airship is too slow to serve as anything more than luxury transport when airplanes are ten times faster. And he's right — in fact, it turns out the company's stocks have been in freefall, and the captain is even plotting to blow up the ship because he wants to get out while he can.

After they capture the Catatonian general Hannibal T. Hairball, the Biker Mice are rather surprised when the villain so incompetent that his older brother Cataclysm does all the work reveals knowledge on what the "clutch" is.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, Odd is usually regarded as not being very bright. However, in one episode in the last season, where a mission to destroy one of XANA's Replikas take him and Yumi's virtual forms to the International Space Station, he actually has <em>two good ideas in the same episode</em>. First, when Jérémie warned them that they have to make the computer's destruction look like an accident (because the Station is too well-known and suspected sabotage would be a headache they do <em>not</em> need), Odd suggests breaking a pipe to cause water damage. His second good idea comes when XANA attacks them using flying, spiked orbs that he is using the Station's equipment to build; he gets rid of them by opening a hatch door, causing the orbs to be blown out of the station.

<div class="indent"><strong>Brittany:</strong> By the way, Daria, I just want you to know I think it's really brave of you to get those contact lenses and admit that you care about the way you look, even just a little. Because knowing that a brain can be worried about her looks makes me feel, um, I don't know, not so shallow or something. Like we're not that different, just human, or whatever. <br/><em>[after a moment, Daria emerges from the stall]</em> <br/><strong>Daria:</strong> Well, thank you, Brittany. You're right.

<div class="indent"><strong>Edd:</strong> Ed, how on earth did you do that? <br/><strong>Ed:</strong> Because I am a brother, and Eddy's brother is a brother, and Eddy is a brother to Eddy's brother as a brother I am.

<ul><li> For example:

<div class="indent"><strong>Wanda:</strong> <em>[writing in diary]</em> "Wednesday March 22nd: Cosmo had an idea!"
</div></li><li> Later in the same episode, Cosmo keeps the TV running by, well, running on a hamster wheel.
<div class="indent"><strong>Wanda:</strong> <em>[writing in diary]</em> "This has been a magnificent day for Cosmo!"
</div></li><li> In "Kung Timmy", while Timmy's Dad is usually pretty much an oblivious fool and somehow at the same time a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Dad</a> he WAS right stating he couldn't beat up Francis for Timmy since he's only a 12 year old child (albeit a really scary looking 12 year old but a kid nonetheless).
</li><li> In "School of Crock", Cosmo again makes a good point when he finds out that Timmy's been sleeping in class:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cosmo:</strong> How are you going to learn anything if you never pay attention?
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em>, the one person who pointed out how illogical the show's premise is turned out to be crazy.

<ul><li> In one episode, Billy suggests that Nergal Jr. turn himself into a pair of pants so that Billy can wear them and win a race:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mandy:</strong> Billy, that has to be the stupidest idea... <em>[stops short]</em> Come to think of it, Billy, that's probably the <em>smartest</em> idea you've ever had. <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> I know. That's why I wanna do it.
</div></li><li> In the episode "Herbicidal Maniac", General Skarr tries to win a gardening award only for Billy to completely ruin his garden and turn him into a plant like creature in the process. Skarr later regrows his garden better than ever while simultaneously wanting to kill Billy for turning him into a freak. Billy sums it up perfectly.
<div class="indent"><strong>Billy:</strong> Well you always were kind of a freak anyways, and your garden is better than ever, and now you got hair so what's the problem again? <br/><strong>Skarr</strong> Look if I want to kill you that's MY prerogative, okay?! <br/><strong>Billy</strong> I'm just saying from a logical point of view— <br/><strong>Skarr</strong> SHUT UP!

<div class="indent"><strong>Skarr:</strong> Just remember! THIS is what you get for being a bad neighbor! <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>[crying]</em> You're the one trying to hurt me, you're the bad neighbor!
</div></li><li> Likewise, after retrieving Grim's scythe and defeating Jack O' Lantern:

<div class="indent"><strong>Gir:</strong> But if the 'sploding goes FAST, won't it be all BAD?
</div></li><li> Dib's insistence on fighting to prevent Zim from conquering the world can also be considered this. Yes, Dib's sister Gaz is totally correct in saying that Zim is too stupid to conquer the planet. But the fact of the matter is that while Zim may be too crazy and stupid to <em>conquer</em> Earth on purpose, he's still plenty crazy-stupid to <em>destroy it by accident while trying</em>. So, yes, Dib really is saving the Earth by his constant foilings of Zim's plots. Just not how either of them actually thinks it's happening.

<ul><li> Dale is a legendarily crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> who is infamous for his inability to recognize that his wife is cuckolding him with his "friend" John Redcorn; in one episode, he admits that he has figured out his visibly Native American son Joseph isn't his biological child (which it took him watching a documentary that it takes 9 months for a baby to be conceived — which is knowledge that even <em>Texas</em> teaches in high school), but attributes his parentage to aliens. Then, in the same sentence that he states that this is why he feels he and Joseph have been unable to fully bond, he declares that Hank Hill's problems with bonding with Bobby stem from Hank being a "crappy dad". Which is actually perfectly true, because Hank Hill has a lot of flaws in the way he approaches rearing his son — he's on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AbusiveParents/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AbusiveParents/WesternAnimation">Abusive Parents</a></em> page for a reason.
</li><li> In a way, Hank Hill himself is a case of this. He is unquestionably the smartest of his band of friends and neighbors, who all recognize him as reliable and dependable, but he is also shown as kind of a bumbling idiot, who is so old-fashioned and conservative that it's laughable.

Korra, Mako, and everyone else is surprised that he'd have such a reasonable suggestion; frustratingly for Mako, Wu admits he only suggested it to impress Korra. In contrast, he also suggests sending an army of trained badger moles to attack Kuvira, which gets him nothing but disdained looks; he ends up vindicated on this point later, however, when two random badgermoles Wu grabbed from the zoo prove to be so effective that one wonders what they could have done if they actually had an army of trained badgermoles available.

When a scene more resembling "Little Red Riding Hood" occurs, Tigger comments, "Hey, for a Big Bad Bunny, he's sure not being very bad." Rabbit (the Big Bad Bunny) replies, "For once, you're right, Tigger. We have lost track of the story, haven't we?"
</li><li> There are some instances where Pooh can bring a good point
<ul><li> In "A Knight to Remember", Pooh and company want to play a game of chess, but some pieces are missing, and it seems they won't be able to play. Then this exchange happens.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Rabbit:</strong> How can we play with missing pieces? <br/><strong>Pooh:</strong> By <em>playing</em> the missing pieces! <br/><strong>Tigger:</strong> Are my ears on too tight, or is Fluff-Boy making sense?
</div><ul><li> Pooh says this about himself in "The Good, the Bad, and the Tigger". When Tigger says Pooh came up with a "terrifical idea", Pooh's response is, "<em>I</em> came up with a terrifical idea? Oh my, this <em>must</em> be a fantasy!"
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Done a few times with Pinky in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em>. Most of the time when Pinky says something stupid it earns him a hit on the head from Brain. But the few times he actually made a good point, Brain is getting ready to hit him out of habit when he stops and thinks and then admits he has a point. One such example comes from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em> episode, where Pinky asks "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Why would Sophia Loren do a musical?</a>", and Brain calls it "a worthy conundrum".
<ul><li> Another example, crossing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap">Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap!</a> is when Pinky accurately points out how hes the 'mommy' of a clone of Brain's from a toenail clipping that got mixed in the experiment.
</li></ul><div class="indent">Brain: "AHHH! Oh my lord you <em>are</em> it's mommy...
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em>, there are times where Rigby has pointed out on how ridiculous the situation can be;
<ul><li> In the episode "Stick Hockey", Rigby points out that Benson does have a responsibility to trust his workers, instead of assuming they'll slack off. Then again, it's the one of the few instances where Mordecai and Rigby actually keep up their end of the bargain.
</li><li> Rigby once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">did this</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rigby:</strong> <em>[rolls eyes after Mordecai moans about Margaret for the umpteenth time]</em> Whatever. You could just ask her out, you know. <br/><strong>Mordecai:</strong> I can't just do that! You don't get it. It's too complicated. <br/><strong>Rigby:</strong> No it's not. Just ask her.
</div><ul><li> In general, Rigby is very logical when it comes to navigating romantic relationships. Naturally, this culminates in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him getting a steady girlfriend, and later, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?" Epilogue</a>, wife, in Eileen</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Bart's Comet":
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've actually picketed against burned up the comet. <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> But what's really amazing, is that this is <em>exactly</em> what Dad said would happen. <br/><strong>Lisa:</strong> Yeah, Dad was right. <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> I know, kids. I'm scared too!
</div></li><li> In "Simpson Safari", when the Simpsons go to Africa when it's revealed that Doctor Bushwell is using the monkeys to run a diamond mine this exchange occurs:
<div class="indent"><strong>Bart:</strong> I think we should look at her research before we condemn her completely. <br/><em>[everyone stares at Bart, shocked]</em> <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> I haven't said anything for a while.
</div></li><li> In "Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part 2", after Smithers was cleared of shooting Burns (because he shot <em>Jasper</em> instead), the normally completely incompetent police chief has this to say:<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2id9l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2id9l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2id9l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Jasper was shot in his prosthetic leg, so he was unharmed.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Chief Wiggum:</strong> Wait a minute! If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it?
</div></li><li> Wiggum gets another one shortly after. When Lisa points out that Burns' recent actions provide motives for several people, namely his oil-drilling endangered both the school and Moe's tavern. After she fingers Skinner, Willie, Moe and Barney, Wiggum points out that Tito Puente would also be a suspect by her logic, as he was supposed to be hired but was fired because of Burns' drilling. Lisa sheepishly concedes to the point. Of course, Wiggum's competence is immediately offset by the fact that Tito Puente stops being a suspect because he plays the police a catchy musical number. The musical number was Tito Puente's revenge against Burns. One of its lyrics was about how bullet wounds are nothing compared to the humiliation the taunting song gives.
</li><li> In "Homer the Vigilante", the entire town is all set to forgive the elderly catburglar who stole from the entire town after he claims he just wanted people to respect the elderly. Wiggum arrests him anyway because the guy had just confessed to burglary. Wiggum's competence is again offset when he and the rest of the town are tricked by the catburglar into chasing after his nonexistent stash.
</li><li> In "Covercraft", Lisa says that Homer is jealous of Apu's musical talents. Homer corrects her, saying that he's envious, and explains the difference ("Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has."); Lisa pulls out a dictionary and confirms that he's right.
</li><li> In "This Little Wiggy", Mayor Quimby is being electrocuted on live TV by an electric chair that everyone except for Bart and Ralph Wiggum believe is turned off. Bart says he needs to think of a way to save Mayor Quimby, and Ralph Wiggum has the brilliant insight that... Lisa's good at thinking. (Cue Lisa saving the day, and everyone cheering Ralph for his good sense.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> Hey! I was the one that came up with the idea! <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> C'mon Lisa, it's Ralph. <br/><em>[Lisa shrugs and then starts cheering for Ralph too]</em>
</div></li><li> "Homer vs. the 18th Amendment" has Homer's opposition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader">Dry Crusader</a> movement seeking to ban Springfield's alcohol. His motivations are clearly that he wants to get drunk and rich off bootlegged alcohol, but he's right when he points out that the prohibition measure is unjust. The measure is actually a grandfathered-in law that hasn't been enforced since the 1700s, the majority of people didn't want it, its enforcement penalty is an absurd death sentence, and the man enforcing it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a> who borders on psychotic—not to mention, it turns out the reason it wasn't enforced was that it was repealed the year after. He also notes that "they tried it in the movies, and it didn't work"—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">while his sources are off,</a> the real-life events that inspired those movies showed just how difficult alcohol prohibition is to enforce with any effectiveness.
</li><li> As pointed out in the DVD commentary, Ralph is uncharacteristically sensible in "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)", even if it's to no avail. He tells Homer it's not a good idea to drink candle wax, but this just gives Homer the idea to coat his mouth in wax in order to withstand the Chief's peppers without regard to what other effects eating several of them might have. When Homer starts to hallucinate, Ralph asks him if he's OK; he only gives up his concern for Homer's welfare when Otto erroneously assures him "he knows what he's doing".
</li><li> "Burns, Baby, Burns" has Homer deciding to fake a kidnapping of Burns's son to get the two to reunite. Marge talks him out of the plan, and tells him to go apologize to Burns. Homer responds that in broad daylight with police on high alert, walking around in the open would get them spotted and caught instantly, but Marge isn't hearing it. Seconds after they're out of the house, they're spotted by helicopters, prompting Kent Brockman to proclaim that only an idiot would decide it was a good idea to head outside in broad daylight with police on high alert.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>, taking advice from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Knuckles</a> on anything is usually a bad idea. However, in "Eggman's Anti-Gravity Ray", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">he gives a surprising insight on true feminism</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTd3Bry-ZT4">by saying that whenever the breaking of gender roles gets called out, it ultimately undermined the gender equality concept by implying that it's an EXCEPTION, not the status quo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Knuckles:</strong> <em>[as everyone stares at him in Stunned Silence]</em> What? Just because I'm a meathead doesn't mean I'm not a feminist.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E7ChefGoesNanners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E7ChefGoesNanners">Chef Goes Nanners</a>", Chef is outraged when the KKK arrives in town to support the town flag (which consists of a black man being hanged by a white crowd) and demands that Officer Barbrady do something about it. Barbrady tells Chef that he can't. While he doesn't like the Klan chanting "White Power" in the town square, they have the right to free speech and he can't arrest them for talking.
</li><li> Close to the end of the alien suit arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> Flash calls Peter out on rejecting his friends when they were trying to support him, leading to him realizing that the suit is changing him along with this hilarious line.
<div class="indent"><strong>Spider-Man:</strong> Okay, if Flash Thompson's making sense, something must be seriously wrong.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Patrick</a> seems to have quite a few of these moments throughout the series.
<ul><li> One such instance has him <em>beating out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Sandy</a></em> in coming up with a plan. The reaction to this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">fairly obvious.</a>
</li><li> In earlier episodes, Patrick tended to be the one to suggest that Squidward didn't like him and SpongeBob. SpongeBob, naturally, found such a notion unthinkable.
</li><li> One episode features SpongeBob and Patrick getting paint on Mr. Krabs' first dollar, his most prized possession. They spend the rest of the episode trying to fix it before Mr. Krabs comes home, only for Patrick to point out how ridiculous the whole situation is. (Hammering the point home, he then decides to use the last dollar in his wallet to buy a chocolate bar.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Patrick:</strong> I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar! Why hang it? You could just hang any dollar bill up on the wall and no one would know the difference! You might as well just reach into my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall!
</div></li><li> In another episode, Patrick states that dumb people are totally unaware of how dumb they really are. Coming from a dim-witted starfish, this is actually true.
</li><li> In "Procrastination" SpongeBob decides to call Patrick in the middle of the night to avoid writing his essay, Patrick replies with this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Patrick:</strong> SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Raven does this to Beast Boy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> at least once. Notably, Beast Boy calls out Robin for acting like Slade in his search for him, as well as showing insight into Terra's character when the Titans were ready to consider her just another villain. In the second to last episode, he also quickly took charge of the remaining heroes, citing that he's had the most experience fighting them.
</li><li> Happens every so often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, and almost always in reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Michelangelo</a>. Usually it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Raphael</a> who gets to admit it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> after listening to Kelly's ramblings about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Taylor's</a> behavior for an entire trip, which is still not finished, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Dwayne</a> gave his viewpoint as a fellow parent and someone who is outside her social circle that Taylor was born spoiled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, Prowl assumes Sentinel is getting help from Lockdown in capturing Megatron's lieutenants, and uses the fact that they are stripped of their equipment as evidence when confronting him. Sentinel shows him Lugnut's mods and points out he'd have to be really stupid not to disarm dangerous prisoners. Prowl is proven to be correct later on, and Lugnut's mods were used to try and "throw him off the scent" — but Sentinel has a point. Incidentally, Starscream had escaped Sentinel's custody once before precisely because he didn't disarm him, so Prowl's assertion is based on past experience.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, when a spike-laden deathtrap comes closing in on them, Hank suggests they contact Dr. Orpheus. Dr. Venture vehemently objects half because Hank is a dumbass and half because he really doesn't like Dr. Orpheus. Brock outright says "I know it sounds crazy, but Hank has the <em>only</em> idea." Dr. Venture only relents when Brock starts lining them up for the least painful death.
