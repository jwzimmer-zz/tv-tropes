<ul><li> Jacuzzi Splot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> initially appears to be a giant crybaby, possibly leading viewers to wonder if the other members of his gang calling him boss is ironic or a mistranslation. Then you see him take out a flamethrower-wielding villain with just a cherry bomb... while bawling his eyes out. Nobody said the "crybaby" descriptor wasn't accurate.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em> manga, where muscular black belt Sugimura is exactly this kind of character, steadfastly refusing to fight even when backed against the wall by street thugs and subsequently branded a coward by all the delinquents in the class. However, he continues this moral stance when on the island, refusing to go for fatal blows and as a result allows the most dangerous kids on the island to go free to kill again. This convinces him to abandon his stance and use firearms in the next fight; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">however, in a cruel twist, his opponent has at this point improved his skills to the point where Sugimura is no match for him.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sado is huge, as tough as nails and very strong. It's because of this that he absolutely refuses to fight for himself even if his life is in danger. As a result, Ichigo made a bargain with him. He'll fight for Sado's life if Sado will fight for his. Ever since Sado will fight to protect the lives of other people but still will not fight to protect his own.
</li><li> Keigo has always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward">avoided conflict</a> in a comedic fashion. Upon seeing what Aizen is capable and comprehending just how screwed he and his classmates are, he steals an unconscious Soul Reaper's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">zanpakutou</a> and prepares to fight Aizen to buy his friends time to escape. Fortunately for him, the zanpakutou's owner regains consciousness just in time to save his life.
</li></ul></li><li> The more aggressive and deadly characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> sometimes accuse Vash the Stampede of being a coward, due to him almost always being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">ridiculously goofy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">extremely nonviolent</a>. By the end of each episode, said characters usually end up seeing him for the saint-like badass that he really is, or are utterly confused and dazed. Others who don't react like that argue that he would've saved thousands of lives if he'd killed his genocidal brother when they first fought 100 years ago. (And a third point of view is that if he <em>did</em> give up pacifism, he'd be on his brother's side, fighting to save his people from the humans unknowingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">killing them for energy</a>.)
</li><li> Tends to happen to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>'s Jou/Joe Kido whenever he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai">the eldest</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">group</a>, he tends to be almost obsessively cautious, until it is clear the others think of him as a coward or his older brother sees him as a doormat. Note that he ends up doing some of the most badass things in the series, including jumping off a roof onto an evil Digimon to save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">TK</a>, getting squeezed like a tube of toothpaste for his troubles, and <em>still</em> telling TK's older brother to beat the <em>other</em> evil Digimon first, 'cause he's just fine; it is this act of selflessness that caused Matt to realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> and causes his Crest to glow. He also climbs a mountain alone to make sure it was safe for the rest of the group to climb it back when his Digimon was not able to evolve and later almost drowns saving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">kid</a> again in a later episode. He also jumps on the back of a GIANT RAMPAGING FLYING HORSE MONSTER to prevent it from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">attacking Tai and Sora</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> An interesting case can be made for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Frieza</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Though he's called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">coward</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroying Planet Vegeta</a> (as he feared the rise of a Super Saiyan, which would be his undoing), he is arguably just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">practical.</a> And even when he starts to lose the fight against Goku, he still swallows his fear and gives him the fight of his life. Such is the case of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">pragmatic villain</a> among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guys.</a>
<ul><li> A more straight forward example can be seen in Android 16. Despite his much larger and more imposing appearance, 16's quiet nature and refusal to fight, as well perhaps as his earlier model number, has him labeled by 17 &amp; 18 as an imperfect model that they mostly keep around for company. His very straightforward focus on his purpose for killing Goku and even being warned off by Dr. Gero himself further push this point. Even when confronted with Cell seeking to assimilate 17 &amp; 18, 16 mostly tries to talk them into running away, to no avail against 17's ego. Finally, after Cell has fought his way through Piccolo and is about to absorb 17, 16 steps in and proceeds to fight Cell to at worst a stalemate and at best a winning bout, trading blow for blow while having the same limitless energy as the other Androids. 16's fight comes on the heels of Cell beating down both Piccolo and 17 effortlessly, albeit the former had expended a lot of stamina, and both were leagues above even Super Saiyans at this point in the series.

</li><li> From the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, Kai Shiden constantly complained and acted selfishly and cowardly in and out of the battlefield, which didn't earn him too many friends. However, he still got in the Guncannon and fought back whenever required, and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taking a few levels in badass</a> his cowardly traits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">disappear completely</a>.

His Wikipedia and Gundam Wiki articles even point out that he tends to be shy and nonviolent in most situations outside of combat, while also having a strong desire to protect people.
<ul><li> Also, Nicol Amalfi.

</li><li> In the Jaya Arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Bellamy mocks Luffy's belief and ultimately decides to beat him and Zoro, but Luffy told him not to fight and they were beaten up. When they next confront Bellamy after, he mocks Luffy for being weak and cowardly. However, this time around Bellamy's made the mistake of stealing from and beating up one of Luffy's friends.

<ul><li> Which is an echo of what Red-Haired Shanks (Luffy's idol) did in the very first chapter (which is probably where Luffy got the attitude from). Shanks allows himself to be humiliated in front of his friends and his men by a lowly bandit chief rather than start a fight, only to come back to kick major butt as soon as the bandits actually start threatening his friends.
<ul><li> And just as a heads up, Shanks is one of the most powerful people <em>in the world</em>. His mere presence can knock out <em>hardened pirates</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the defining trait of Usopp: He will spend much of a conflict trying to run away, but he will invariably regain his bearings and wallop the enemy he feels he's most suited to fight. That being said, when he DOES fight, he still has a "coward" motif to his style, using hit-and-run tactics and keeping his distance with long-range attacks. This reaches its peak when he fights ghost-girl Perona, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Usopp figures out her powers, he instantly turns the tables and leaves her foaming at the mouth from terror over him.</span>
<ul><li> A prime example is in Arlong Park. One of the enemy pirates comes after Usopp, who of course runs away screaming at first. But when the pirate notices the townsfolk present at the time, Usopp turns back around, provokes the enemy into continuing the chase, then goes right back to running and screaming. Said townspeople honestly can't tell if he's brave or cowardly.

However, it's later revealed that without his stubborn pacifism, Kyoshiro is even more dangerous than Kyo.

Fortunately, the Guardians of the Universe and a dying Abin Sur weren't as biased and recruited him as the sector's Green Lantern. He saved the world.
</li><li> The Animated version of this story has a dying Abin Sur explain to Hal Jordan exactly why his status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoCalledCoward">The So-Called Coward</a> makes him the only kind of person worthy of wielding a Green Lantern ring.
<div class="indent"><strong>Abin Sur:</strong> I had to find a deserving one. A man entirely without fear. <br/><strong>Hal Jordan:</strong> A lot of people think I'm a coward because of what happened in the war. Did your ring tell you about that? <br/><strong>Abin Sur:</strong> You are no coward, Hal Jordan! To you, all life is precious — and this ring is far too powerful to fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that.
</div></li><li> Kyle Rayner, another major Green Lantern, has gotten this on occasion since he has no real badass nature or backstory. Hal Jordan was praised by superheroes for being "The Man Without Fear," which is actually a common requirement for Green Lanterns, while Kyle feels fear like any normal person. At one point Ganthet referred to Kyle's ability to be afraid as "a defect," as opposed to the other way around. Of course, the Sandman said that made him better than Jordan, and the other Lanterns wound up having to learn to "remember" fear in order to avoid being overtaken by Parallax.
<ul><li> The reason why Kyle is often considered one of the most powerful Lanterns in history (and eventually became the godlike Ion) is <em>because</em> he knows fear and has learned to overcome it. A man who knows no fear doesn't have anywhere near the willpower of a man who can rise above his fear.
</li><li> This is now how new Lanterns are selected. The older Lanterns were chosen for their lack of fear; those chosen since the re-ignition of the central battery on Oa are chosen for their ability to overcome it.
</li><li> At the same time, it's also been shown that the reason Hal has no fear is that he's already experienced his greatest fear in the past.

<ul><li> There is a Japanese folk tale about a bully who harassed a man eating with his wife by taking away his chopsticks. When the wife demanded them back, the bully just laughed at her. Wife proceeded to beat the tar out of said bully and took back her husband's chopsticks. A witness asked her where she learned to fight and she answered: "My husband taught me." When asked why her husband didn't fight himself, she answered: "He's afraid he might kill someone."

Though his travels have made him skittish and jaded, and he would like nothing better than to sit at home in a quiet room, he has: saved the Disc from incineration using a creation spell lodged in his head; challenged a powerful Sourcerer with only a half-brick in a sock despite knowing that it would lead to almost certain death or <em>worse</em>; took it upon himself to distract countless nightmares from the Dungeon Dimensions to prevent them from invading the Disc; journeyed through Hell; prevented civil war in Agatea; saved the continent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Fourecks</a> by bringing rain; and saved the Disc from destruction <em>again</em> by joining a space mission and talking down a band of the deadliest barbarian warriors of all time.

Doing this leaves him alienated from many of his peers, and he later has to face down a lynch mob (who included some of his friends,) to protect his client and gets publicly spat on by his opponent (who he then refuses to fight). He knew all of this would happen, and he took the job anyway.

Turns out he's a pacifist for truly idealistic reasons and is quite possibly the bravest person in the book. As the war progresses, he volunteers as a medical worker in the front lines and during the climactic battle dies heroically from wounds earned carrying a vital message under heavy fire.

An SS flunky demands to know which of them are Jews. This secretary faces down the SS officer, telling him that he has no right to that information, and announcing in effect that either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">none of them are Jews or all of them</a>.

<ul><li> The puppeteers are a race of cowards. A very few, who are considered by their own kind to be insane (and who often exhibit personality disorders recognizable to humans) are just brave enough to leave their homeworld in ships made of virtually indestructible material and equipped with emergency stasis fields in which they can wait out the end of the universe if necessary. One of these scouts, Nessus, is a manic depressive who often curls up into a motionless ball in his depressive state. He turns his back to run from any danger... although he might just be getting ready to kick your heart out through your chest with his hind leg. To give a frame to the extent of his depressive states, at one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> he asks to go into a building during a conversation in the street, <em>afraid of the infinitesimal probability that a meteor could kill him</em>. Nessus goes out into the big scary universe because, although he is truly terrified by the dangers amongst the stars, he feels a great sense of duty to his people that, since he can bear to face such dangers, he must protect the rest. His altruism extends to the human companions he often hires, whom he has more than once risked his own life to save. After such moments of heroism, he becomes a blubbering mess when he realizes just how much danger he was actually in.
</li><li> Louis Wu is a pretty good human example. His first reaction to violence is to run away. That said, he never <em>panics</em> while he runs away, and his running away is almost always so he can get into a better position to kill you from a distance.

Counter-intuitively, the kitten, mouse, and dog were all described as being very brave, while the dragon was a coward. However, when a pirate broke into the house and threatened Belinda, the three supposedly 'brave' animals ran and hid, and Custard stood his ground, fought the pirate, and ate him.

He's more of a 'win your battles without fighting' kind of guy, then an outright coward. While he himself thinks that he's a yellowbelly, he's more the sort to "avoid battle at all costs and kick 'em in the nuts when their not looking", and he does so in the series, where he tries to avoid fighting and only fight when he has an advantage. Nevertheless, when the chips are down he immediately takes command, turns into a veritable 'Nelson IN SPACE' and amongst his command staff is the first to see opportunity and the way to victory. The real kicker is that while his subordinates are elite sailors, who all graduate from the top military academy, he's a civilian who was drafted.

Childermass refuses the duel, assures the soldier he means his mistress no harm, and rides away. When he later recounts the story to Norrell and Mr. Lascelles, Lascelles derides him as a dishonourable coward. In fact, Childermass is just savvy enough to realise that the soldier was obviously enchanted by a fairy spell, and if he'd entered into a duel without fully understanding the situation Childermass would have needlessly put himself at risk in ways that he didn't understand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A fact proven when Lascelles finds himself on the same fairy road, encounters the same soldier, accepts his duel and kills him... only for <em>Lascelles</em> to end up falling under the same spell and taking the soldier's place.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> is a whole <em>interstellar civilisation</em> with this reputation. They mostly live by ideals of peace over war and defence rather than conquest if fighting is necessary, mutual cooperation and understanding, individual rights and self-expression balanced with honouring whatever group one has joined, and other ideas that would seem to mark them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealists</a>. They also have a well-armed, well-trained, and most of all <em>large</em> fleet to back those up if needed, and, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> made clear, a tendency to start looking like the best option going...

</div><ul><li> The best example of understatement of the Federation's military strength would have to be the <em>Galaxy</em>-class starship, made famous as Picard's Enterprise. Here is a ship classified as an "Explorer", responsible for charting unknown regions of space, and discovering new life forms and civilisations. Yet the <em>Galaxy</em>-class has enough firepower to take on pure warships like the Klingon <em>Vor'cha</em> attack cruiser and the Romulan <em>D'deridex</em> Warbird — both of which are considered pure battleships by the series. During the Dominion war story arc of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, Galaxy-class ships were responsible for more Dominion losses than any other ship class in the Federation fleet. The two circumstances where Galaxy-class ships were lost in direct combat both involved weaponry modified to pass through energy shields and one suffering a kamikaze attack.
</li><li> Another is the <em>Nebula</em>-class, which main role is science and research, one despite losing its shields, due to weaponry modified to pass through energy shields, still ripped apart a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Cardassian warship in seconds</a>. You soon realize why Cardassia never ever wants a war with the Federation ever again.
</li><li> When the Federation stopped playing around and actually made a dedicated warship in the <em>Defiant</em>-class, they end up making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">Pint-Sized Powerhouse</a> that can take on ships many times its own size. USS Defiant survived a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">kamikaze assault</a> on a Borg cube. Admittedly Enterprise-E did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">intervene at the last moment</a> but it's still an impressive feat for such a tiny vessel. For pacifists, the Federation know how to build pocket warships.
</li><li> The <em>Sovereign</em>-class is a post-359 design probably intended to replace the <em>Galaxy</em>-class. It's still a science and exploration vessel in intent, but you would be foolish to screw with one. It carries the brand-new Quantum Torpedo weapon system, capable of taking out a Borg sphere in two or three shots and its new shields can shrug off Borg tractor beams/particle weapons.

None of them are actually cowards (one has flat feet, the other is a sincere conscientious objector, etc), but most of the humour comes from their various attempts at proving this to others leading them into unfortunate situations.

<ul><li> During the early days of Islam, as the religion was just gaining followers, the new followers were constantly attacked, beaten, and persecuted with no resistance because the Prophet told them to maintain peace. When they finally had formed a community, and their persecutors decided to wage a battle with them, God finally said that they could fight back. The battle that occurred at Badr was an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> for the ages.

The fact that the Tau have weapons that outstrip humans' in range and damage may also have something to do with it: the Tau suck at close combat, so they make sure the enemy is dead before they can close.
</li><li> More reasonable Imperial commanders often fall victim to this any time they do something to reduce casualties.

The fact that Valhalan 597 took three times fewer casualties and made twice the kills while undermanned and underequipped helped to clear the picture, but it took some time for the concept to settle. Similarly, Space Marines often have quite a low opinion on anyone utilizing "dishonorable" tactics.

But when the class goes back to the time of the dinosaurs, Arnold yells at an attacking <em>T. rex</em>, and <em>scares it away</em>.

Arnold plays second fiddle for the most part. But at the end when Janet overloads on rocks and refuses to leave them behind. Arnold gets fed up and actually <em>take his helmet off</em> to show her what'll happen if she stays in space. Janet quickly abandons the rocks to get Arnold back home and his head defrosted.

</li><li> And when Rarity is kidnapped by a gang of gem loving ruffians, all of her friends suspect her to be completely helpless as their prisoner. Not only did she manage to free herself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist">but she made her would-be kidnappers into her sniveling servants</a>, topping it all off with the moral that "just because [she] is a lady doesn't mean [she] is helpless."

Because he's forced to run away from battle to engage in his secret transformation to He-Man, he's forced to accept a reputation for being a coward. When he's forced to act as Prince Adam instead of He-Man, this can result in characters who don't know his secret being shocked by his sudden desire to "play hero". In the 80s series, there's an indication that Prince Adam himself lacks confidence as a result of this and therefore often doesn't have enough faith in himself resulting in a rare overlap with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Cowardly Lion</a> trope. In the 2002 series, Prince Adam is instead a cocky 16-year-old boy who has to learn the wisdom of accepting the hit to his pride for the sake of the greater good and he therefore doesn't have the self-doubts of his 80s-series counterpart.

Other characters, particularly Teela and his father King Randor, take note of this and think Adam a coward. Of course, Adam can't give a good explanation of his actions, as that would risk his secret identity, so he spends quite a bit of time living with the stigma of being a coward.

<ul><li> During WWII, those conscientious objectors who couldn't avoid military service were usually made medics/corpsmen and were stuck on the front lines with no weapons.
<ul><li> Lew Ayres became a pacifist after filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllQuietOnTheWesternFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllQuietOnTheWesternFront">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></em> and enlisted as a conscientious objector in World War Two. His films were blacklisted due to the outrage. However, Ayres ended up joining the medical corps and served under fire in the Pacific.
</li><li> Three received Medals of Honor for actions that sound nigh impossible. In World War II, Desmond Doss, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HacksawRidge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HacksawRidge">Hacksaw Ridge</a></em> fame, personally lowered scores of wounded men down a rope litter off a cliff while still exposed to fire. He was later wounded, treated his own wounds rather than call for help, waited for others to carry him off, then got off the litter so another soldier with worse injuries could get on it. He was injured again, treated his own injury again, and crawled to an aid station. The other two served in Vietnam and died tending to the wounded while under direct fire. They are also the only conscientious objectors honored with a Medal of Honor.
</li></ul></li><li> Mohandas Gandhi repeatedly insisted that his doctrine of nonviolence was the opposite of cowardice: "Nonviolence and cowardice are contradictory terms. Nonviolence is the greatest virtue, cowardice, the greatest vice. Nonviolence springs from love, cowardice from hate. Nonviolence always suffers, cowardice would always inflict suffering. Perfect nonviolence is the highest bravery." And despite his own pacifistic tendencies, he even asserted that violence was preferable to cowardice.
<ul><li> By extension Martin Luther King Jr. who modeled his nonviolent protest on Gandhi's policy in India was the same way, standing up to racism with words, not violence.

One time, a local tough guy tried to bully Norris into giving him his seat at a bar. Norris quietly complied. Later, tough guy realized who he was talking to and asked Norris why he didn't kick his ass. Norris replied, "What would it prove?"
</li><li> Sun Tzu urges diplomacy at all costs to avoid conflict. His reasoning for this is if you do have to go to war, it should be swift and merciless, with all available power committed to winning. A quick bloodbath incurs fewer casualties and achieves better success than a long, drawn-out war. (He also recommends using espionage and other asymmetrical means to hasten the end of the war.)
</li><li> Rabbits. Wild rabbits, in particular, can be particularly nasty to anything they perceive as dangerous, despite the common perception of rabbits always running off. Rabbits have been seen biting <em>snakes</em> and forcing the snakes to retreat. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E_SxwbotS0">Here's an example.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In his youth, the ancient Chinese general Han Xin was confronted by a local bully who told him to either take his sword and kill him, or crawl through his legs. Han Xin chose to crawl through his legs. Later, after Han Xin became commander of the Han armies and king of Qi and Chu, he came across the bully again. Instead of punishing him, Han Xin gave him a nice job in his army.
</li><li> France's military has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">the nasty reputation</a> of being cowards and wimps, but their military is ranked <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp">fifth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> on GFP's list of military strength. France actually has a fairly aggressive military policy and is more than willing to intervene in other countries (usually those with former French connections), it's just that the French government has a "go it alone" attitude that doesn't always see eye to eye with the Americans when it comes to foreign policy. A significant amount of Allied war power and success in Nazi-occupied France was facilitated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">''civilian'' rebellions</a>. Despite "cheese-eating surrender monkey" accusations towards the French, they do <em>not</em> play around when the chips are finally down.
<ul><li> Those who use the "cheese-eating surrender monkey" stereotype forget, if they ever knew, the almost literally unbelievable cost that France paid during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the Great War</a>; <em>90%</em> of French ground forces were casualties, either KIA, MIA or wounded in action. Sadly, this enormous sacrifice paved the way for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Vichy France</a>, from which the slur almost entirely originates; the nation surrendered so totally that the Germans felt confident setting up a nominally "neutral" government (as contrasted with Poland, Norway, and the Low Countries). It doesn't help that during this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">shameful</a> period, many of the occupied were complicit with Nazi atrocities, using the Reich as an excuse to get rid of people they didn't like, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">such as foreign-born Jews in France.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> was accused of being cowardly when he refused to be drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, saying that enlisting went against his religious beliefs. When he explained himself at a college event, it led to a showdown with some students, and he didn't back down.

They probably don't carry that much money anyway, and that phone's probably insured. But when the stakes are higher (say, protecting a friend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">their</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">children</a> from a rapist, or any other person who wants to kill/severely injure their loved ones), rest assured that now they will give everything they've got to save the day. In other words, they know when the stakes are so low that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">it's not worth the chance, however remote, to get killed over them</a> and when the stakes are high enough that it is worth the risk.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus</a>'s famous Fabian strategy caused him to be considered a coward by many as he refused to attack Hannibal outright.

His strategy worked to the point that he eventually surrounded Hannibal who only escaped by tricking him into attacking oxen. He was also willing to rush to the aid of his rival and Master of Horse Minucius when he boldly attacked Hannibal and lost. Lucius Aemilius Paullus who took command after him even admitted that he was right in a private message delivered after his death at the disaster at Cannae. After Cannae, he was turned to for advice as everyone had learned just how smart he was.
