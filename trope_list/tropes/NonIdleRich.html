</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>: Death the Kid. Thanks to being Death's son, and having a privileged position in Death City (Death apparently runs the place, they're clearly rich), Kid could wait for someone else to make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Death Scythe</a> to use. However, he decides to go the old-fashioned way (and indeed, because of Death the Kid's obsession with symmetry, he ends up with Liz and Patty, the Thompson sisters as his Weapons, so he has to do twice the work technically) and joins the school to do so properly. He becomes an invaluable ally and friend to the rest of the group and he himself matures and overcomes his own faults along with helping his partners overcome their shady pasts.)
</li><li> Most of the nobles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> have important jobs such as Angelina Durless (AKA Madame Red), who is a doctor, Ciel's father Vincent Phantomhive, who was said in the anime to have done lots of work to help the poor and needy, and Undertaker (give a wild guess as to what he does). Ciel himself works as the Queen's Watchdog, taking care of problems in the criminal underworld (though sometimes the work he does enters more dubious territory).
</li><li> In the Lewis Carroll-inspired manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>, the 19th-century land in which it is set is governed by four dukedoms, which are in charge of running the organisation known as Pandora, whose job it is to protect the public from and take care of matters involving the dimension known as the Abyss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: While Detective Ninzaburou Shiratori comes from a very rich family, he is certainly one of the more competent and hardworking police officers there and there's no evidence about him using his family influence to climb the bureaucratic ladder.
</li><li> Yuichiro Kumada in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> comes from a very wealthy family but works regularly, eventually taking a steady job as a "chore boy" at the shrine Rei's grandfather owns. Partly because he liked Rei and partly because he's ashamed of his rich, self-absorbed family.
<ul><li> There's also Ami/Sailor Mercury's mother Saeko, who also comes from a very wealthy family but works full time as a doctor. Ami herself intends to follow this path as well.
</li><li> In the manga, Rei's father Takashi Hino is not only stinking rich but he's also a very important politician. Problem is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">he is also incredibly neglectful</a> so Rei far prefers to live with her maternal grandfather at the shrine.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots">Medabots</a></em> had our heroes visiting a private school for the fabulously wealthy. One of the students was periodically seen cleaning and doing chores, and everyone assumed that she was a poor girl working off the fees for her education. At the end of the episode, it turned out she was actually the richest student there and owned her own theme park... she just <em>really enjoyed doing housework</em>.

<ul><li> The Netherlands and Switzerland are among the richest nations, but they still work hard and do their best to not spend money unless it's really needed.
</li><li> The Netherlands's younger siblings Belgium and Luxembourg are also very affluent and, while less stingy than the other two, also work hard to keep their and their people's living standards. Belgium is even seen as a finances whiz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">as a little girl nation</a>, <em>before</em> Netherlands started amassing his fortune.

Ever since she was a little girl, she's been interested in helping the lower classes of her poverty-stricken home of Mars. And while she's a bit naive in how the world works, one certainly cannot fault her for effort. This results in her becoming a symbol for the oppressed and a heroine of the common people, giving her a measure of political influence that she intends to use to correct the problems with her society.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics">Disney comics</a> <em>love</em> this trope:
<ul><li> Scrooge McDuck, in any incarnation. Aside for running his own company, he cannot live without undertaking a ridiculously difficult treasure hunt or a potentially fatal adventure at least twice a week, and nearly shows signs of depression if he's idle too long. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> comic <em>The Status Seeker</em>, later adapted into an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em>, had Scrooge deal with his rich peers looking down on him for not "acting rich."
<ul><li> Before their falling-out, Scrooge's sisters could count on his fortune... And ran the company's daily operations while Scrooge was traveling the world to become the world's richest duck. They also followed him in his travels to Panama and Africa, the latter leading to their falling out.
</li></ul></li><li> Scrooge's main rival Flintheart Glomgold, who also runs his own company, may show up once in a while trying to one-up Scrooge in a treasure hunt or a difficult adventure, mainly to try and become richer. Unlike Scrooge, Glomgold has no morals and will sink to whatever means to beat Scrooge (yes, he is not above murder.)
</li><li> Scrooge's <em>other</em> rival John Rockerduck does the same, but that's usually because he wants to one-up Scrooge. He too runs his own company, <em>and</em> is a noted philanthropist. Unlike with Flintheart, John is just a competitive rival to Scrooge, but the two are still affable (contrast to the mutual intense <em>loathing</em> Glomgold and Scrooge have to one another). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">This also applies to his known relatives</a>:
<ul><li> Rockerduck's father Howard, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">who built the family fortune from scratch</a> in a gold rush, used to run the family company, routinely inspects the companies he's an investor of, and for 2 cents he may come down and teach you how to be a prospector. The latter two helped to create <em>Scrooge's</em> fortune, as they met during one of Howard's inspections and Scrooge, then inexperienced as a prospector, reacted to his criticism by paying him those 2 cents.
</li><li> In the late 19th century, Howard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">unnamed brother</a> ran a construction firm near Duckburg, with John being one of the foremen. This led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John Rockerduck directing the construction of <em>Scrooge's original Money Bin</em>, as Scrooge hadn't set up his own construction companies in Calisota yet</span>.

As members of the samurai class, no player ever needs to worry about affording food, shelter or clothing, and every samurai starts with enough money to sustain a normal person for roughly three to four months (on top of their starting gear). However, every samurai is expected to serve their Clan and the Empire in some capacity, even if it's as simple as negotiating or politicking in the court, and most have at least rudimentary combat training <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">just in case.</a>

Rogue Traders are individuals that have been granted a special Warrant of Trade that gives them extraordinary freedoms and rights, allowing them to operate on a scale that normal merchants simply can't.

<ul><li> Rogue Traders are among the few people who can accumulate enough wealth to personally own a starship, and each ship employs thousands, or even tens of thousands, of workers.

Rockefeller nevertheless managed to parlay his obscene wealth (he was quite possibly the richest man <em>anywhere, ever</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06evy');"><sup>estimate </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06evy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06evy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His main business was Standard Oil, which became the literal definition of a monopoly, to the point where it was the target of one of the very first anti-trust government actions. In 1911, Standard Oil was broken into 34 so-called "baby Standards", some of which later became BP, Exxon, Chevron, Mobil, Pennzoil, and others. Rockefeller owned nearly 25% of Standard Oil and was given equal shares in the broken-up companies, so while his companies' market share overall declined, his own personal wealth shot into the stratosphere as most of those new companies flourished with an ever-expanding oil market. Adjusted for inflation, his fortune would be worth over <strong>$400 billion</strong> today. Even after his immense charitable giveaways and downturns over the years, his trusts and holdings have given seven generations and nearly 200 direct descendants wealth on an immense scale.</span> ) into all manner of charitable causes, and his descendants are noted for their commitment to public service. The most notable of these is probably his grandson Nelson Rockefeller, who was a highly effective four-term Governor of New York and then was appointed Vice President of the US by Gerald Ford about a year before the expiration of his fourth term.
<ul><li> Nelson's son Michael served in the army and became an anthropologist. Unfortunately, he went on an expedition to New Guinea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">didn't end well.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Philanthropist Brook Astor definitely qualifies.
</li><li> Athina Roussel Onassis could have easily lived from the money inherited from her maternal family, being the last living Onassis. (There's still the matter about her actually inheriting only her mother Christina's money or the whole Onassis fortune, though). She, however, is a show jumper and a sponsor/patron of the Global Champions Tour.
</li><li> Many entertainers (actors, musicians, etc.) continue to work for the love of the job, or at least the fame, long after they're set for life financially. Oprah, for example.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySeinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySeinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>'s personal fortune is estimated at $800 million. He still insists on spending part of every year traveling the country, doing live stand-up like he's always done.
</li></ul></li><li> Jill Biden is a professor of English at Northern Virginia Community College and is thought to be the first woman to hold a paying job while her husband is Vice President.
<ul><li> Incidentally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a> himself was consistently listed as the <em>poorest</em> member of Congress—he came from a working-class background and was elected to the Senate at age <em>29</em> (the minimum age to serve is 30; he turned 30 a few weeks after the election and thus met the qualification), and thus had little accumulated wealth prior to politics (he had served as a public defender and then as a small-time corporate lawyer in Delaware for a few years).
</li></ul></li><li> Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York 2002-2014, is the 20th richest person in the world. He's also a very popular (if eminently easy to to make jokes about) and, by most accounts very effective, three-term mayor (although his connections to Wall Street and incessant nanny-state policy proposals started to chafe by the end of the third term). Also probably incorruptible, for the simple reason that it's hard to bribe a man who has $22 billion.
</li><li> In response to accusations that he is a rich, tenured professor and thus in no position to lecture anyone on the working class, Noam Chomsky responds that responsibility "accrues through privilege", and that responsibility is amplified by the freedoms Americans and Europeans enjoy.
</li><li> Howard Hughes. After he flew around the Arctic circle he even said, "What's that they say about the idle rich again? I must not have heard." Though born into money he greatly advanced his personal wealth by ventures into a variety of fields. First, he financed and directed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellsAngels">Hell's Angels</a> the first multi-million dollar production, and one of the most successful movies of history. Then he ventured into aviation, patenting and inventing a number of innovative concepts like powered control surfaces and grounded in rivets. As a pilot he set numerous records, some of them in planes of his design. Hell, no one was able to build a more massive aircraft than the Spruce Goose for decades. In his later years, he became a reclusive hermit who pretty much owned Las Vegas. Many speculate if he didn't have such horrible germophobia and other mental illnesses that he would have made much more than Rockefeller.
<ul><li> Not to mention various undercover work he did for US government, many of which remain unknown. His involvement in the Project Azorian, the secret CIA plot to steal a sunken Soviet nuclear missile submarine, is about the only such project that is reasonably well-known to this day. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod">Word of Stan Lee</a> has that Tony Stark is significantly based on Hughes.
</li><li> Did Hughes really suffer from serious mental illnesses near the end of his life? Project Azorian took place in 1972 when Hughes was supposedly well in the depth of his madness. Maybe the apparent insanity was just a cover?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordDunsany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordDunsany">Lord Dunsany</a> got so much grief from the assumption that a peer could not be a serious writer that he seriously thought of changing his byline to Edward Plunkett — but he had built up too much reputation as Lord Dunsany to give it up.
</li><li> At the Grand Floridian Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, one of the line cooks at Gasparilla's Grill and Games (a quick service/fast food restaurant at the hotel) recently was acclaimed by the company for donating a million dollars to one of the company's sponsored charities. Turns out his family is to Florida what the Kennedys are to Massachusetts.
</li><li> David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowden, is the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon</a> and nephew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">HM The Queen</a> — he's loaded, is what we're saying. He makes furniture. Bespoke furniture, yes, but he does seem to have handled the physical assembly, at least in his younger days.
<ul><li> His father, Antony Armstrong-Jones, was an award-winning photographer with a career spanning several decades, including during and after his marriage to Princess Margaret. One theory holds that the reason their marriage lasted as long as it did was that he would be away from home for weeks and months at a time on newspaper assignments and other projects, such that the couple would not have time enough together to be sick of each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Chinese sanitation worker Yu Youzhen became wealthy when she and her husband were compensated after the Government seized their land for development. Despite this, she kept her job to set an example for her children.
</li><li> R&amp;B/Soul superstar Bill Withers got his start in the music industry rather late in life and didn't start charting hits until his thirties. Still, he managed to make a pretty penny from his musical career, enough to where he was able to retire early. He didn't rest on his laurels, however; he started up his own construction company and was known to be very actively involved with his own business.
</li><li> The Food Network program "The Pioneer Woman" shows the Drummond family to be this. The Drummonds are one of the richest ranching families in the U.S., owning many thousands of acres of land and hundreds upon hundreds of cows. They raise their children to be hard workers, however; part of the reason why Ree Drummond home-schools her and her husband Ladd's four children is so that the children can help out around the ranch, which demands that they wake up along with the other ranch employees at 4:00 in the morning and devote all of their early morning to doing real work on the ranch. It's implied that Ladd and his brother were also raised that way.
</li><li> Matt Farah is the creator of automotive enthusiast website <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thesmokingtire.com">The Smoking Tire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. His father? None other than Roger Farah, former Chief Operating Officer of Ralph Lauren.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> could have stayed behind the scenes running the Wrestling/WWE without ever appearing on television. Instead, he's done everything from ringside commentating on WWE shows to personally testing safety equipment to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">personally competing in wrestling matches himself</a> at an age when many men would be thinking about retirement. A lifelong amateur bodybuilder, even in his seventies he has a physique that would shame most men half his age. His children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie</a> followed in his footsteps, appearing as characters and competing in their own grueling wrestling matches, Shane in particular notorious for his borderline insane stunts involving him jumping off high places onto someone else.
</li><li> While not to the wealth levels of some of the other examples, Joe Bryant played almost a decade with the NBA and then almost another decade in Italy. After that he coaches basketball internationally, most recently with <em>Rizing Zephyr Fukuoka</em>. His son Kobe didn't have to play b-ball (or do much at all), but he's one of the NBA all-time greats, has contributed to various business start-ups and charitable organizations and won an Academy award for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DearBasketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DearBasketball">Dear Basketball</a></em>.
