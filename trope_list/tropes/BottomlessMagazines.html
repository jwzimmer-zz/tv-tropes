In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, most revolvers hold between 5 to 8 shots, depending on caliber, while semiautomatic handguns have magazines that usually hold 1015 shots. Pump-action, bolt-action, and lever-action longarms generally hold 58 rounds (but the magazine can easily be topped off) and detachable-magazine semi-automatic or automatic rifles generally hold at least 20, if not 30 rounds.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0o5gn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0o5gn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0o5gn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That great big circular drum magazine seen on the classic Thompson Submachine Gun in gangster movies holds 50 rounds in real life, and an even bigger one holds 100...but sadly these tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">cumbersome</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">likely to jam</a>.</span> But keep a running count, and you'll sometimes see a weapon go for much longer without hesitation.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Ammo capacity of guns on TV seems to be totally dependent on how much drama and suspense is needed. The hero will always have plenty of ammo to mow down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, but will run out just before reaching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, or confront him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft">One Bullet Left</a>. Reloading is usually only done when it adds to the drama or when you need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload">show off how badass the gunslinger is</a>. If someone is firing an automatic weapon that's belt-fed or has a large banana-shaped magazine in it, forget it — he's <em>never</em> going to run out until you shoot him dead. The only thing that seems to stop a movie or TV gun from firing is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">inevitable and dramatic jam</a>.
</p><p>Can be partially explained by editing in some of the less unrealistic movies. If multiple shots of a gunfight flow well together, shot counts might be ignored, rather than breaking the flow by putting in a reload shot. Likewise, editing has temporal considerations, and if the camera cuts to a different angle while the shots are occurring, you may be seeing the same shots repeated from different perspectives, making the actual number of shots fired lower than what was perceived.

</p><p>An adjunct to this would be the Bottomless Quiver for archers. Many an archer in animation and videogames can pour out a stream of arrows without ever hitting the supply cart.

Not at all related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash">Topless Magazines</a>.
</p><p>This may end up becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">acceptable break from reality</a> in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a>; who wants to pull their fighter plane over to the side to top up on the 20mm ammo in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot 'em Up</a>?
</p><p>Even in video games where you <em>do</em> have to reload, typically shooters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">the game doesn't keep track of individual magazines</a>. You can reload at any point without wasting bullets or having to move bullets from one magazine to another. When the game invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">Universal Ammunition</a>, the rules just get that much fuzzier. If you're unlucky, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">some people's magazines might be more bottomless than others</a>.
</p><p>A common justification in science fiction stories is that future firearms actually fire extremely tiny projectiles (hundreds or even thousands of which can be packed into a single magazine). Since kinetic energy is a factor of both mass and velocity, firing mechanisms that allow the projectile to be shot in a very, very high velocity can compensate (or more) for the size of the bullet. Stronger characters sometimes have the 'cheats' of an absurdly large magazine relative to their body size (e.g. having their gun belt-fed from a backpack) or internal magazines whose capacity cannot be accurately calculated. Neither of these can actually <em>be</em> bottomless, but since viewers can't tell the actual number of rounds, they're less likely to have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> broken.
</p><p>This trope often goes hand-in-hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>. Compare against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountingBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountingBullets">Counting Bullets</a>, which is about limited magazines.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. Franky is the most noticeable offender, apparently having a nail machine gun in his arm (which should logically hold only four nails) and a cannon, which he is never seen reloading. This is taken to ridiculous heights by anyone who uses a flintlock for their primary weapon.
<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the flintlocks used in One Piece are capable of holding multiple bullets. While such things did actually exist in real life, they were rare prototypes that were both bulky and unreliable, whereas One Piece's flintlocks look identical to the normal single-shot types.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari">Katanagatari</a></em> has Entou Jyuu, a pair of guns that never run out of bullets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Justified as they were created using future technology.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> does this, as nearly every gun user, and one character who fights by throwing bayonets, is shown to have unlimited ammunition, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> combined with an implausibly large number of reloads. The creator jokingly states at one end-of-manga rant that Alucard's firearms are "cosmoguns" that hold an enormous amount of ammunition, while the bayonet-using Anderson is just "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">fourth dimensional</a>".
<ul><li> An exception to this is the "anti-tank rifle" used during the attack on Hellsing mansion. It holds only one shell and reloading takes a realistic amount of time. Then again it might very well be done purely for drama. Though this becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> when they get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">fully</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">automatic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">version...</a>
</li><li> Alucard <em>is</em> seen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload">reload</a> in the manga and at least once in the anime, but that's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in the final episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> anime when, during his fight with Incognito, Alucard runs out of ammo for The Jackal until Seras brings him a reload. Of course, he then goes on to fire 8 or so shots from a magazine that's explicitly stated to hold 6 rounds.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with Vash's opponents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, who never seem to run out of ammunition. This becomes even more confusing/distressing with Elendira the Crimson Nails who seems to have an infinite number of giant nails hidden in her briefcase gun.
<ul><li> And except for a hilarious subversion of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> at the beginning (and despite complaining that bullets are hideously expensive), Vash never runs out of bullets, either.
</li><li> Another exception is the standoff with Knives at the end of the series, where both of them have only one bullet each and are playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a> with the other person's gun in their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eye</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CorpsePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CorpsePrincess">Corpse Princess</a></em>: Makina fires something like 500 rounds each from her dual <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC-11">submachine guns<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> before changing magazines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> is inconsistent on this, as on some occasions weapons (both kinetic <em>and</em> energy) are shown to have ammo limits, but generally mobile suits will only need to reload when it is <em>least</em> convenient to reload.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">original Gundam</a> is shown to run out of power for its beam rifle on several occasions, at least, though at these points he'll rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">toss the rifle away</a> because, in that series, the ability to actually reload beam weapons in the field doesn't exist yet. Other requirements like fuel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics">are also skimmed over entirely</a>, despite how much of a big deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">outside sources</a> make about it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Heavyarms</a> has been shown to run out of ammo on multiple occasions, most pointedly in its battle with Sandrock early in the series, as well as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz">Endless Waltz</a></em>; its magazines aren't bottomless, but they're sure as hell high-capacity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em> mostly follows this as well, though there is one occasion, during the battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Norris Packard</a>, where Shiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">expends a hell of a lot of ammo</a> and promptly runs out in the middle of emptying his gun in the enemy's direction. Interestingly, power requirements for the ground-type Gundams' beam sabers are rarely acknowledged, despite the fluff mentioning they only carry enough power for a single minute of use and then require <em>fifteen</em> to recharge.

Rather, he's instead developed the tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">discard an empty weapon and pull out new, fully-loaded one</a>. This is evidenced in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Fumoffu</a></em>, where he plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> arcade game and gets flustered when he runs out of ammo, proceeding to pull out his <em>real</em> gun and blowing the game away (and when told the method to actually reload - namely, pointing the light gun away from the screen and pulling the trigger - he replies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">this would be horribly unsafe</a>). It works for him though — he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">certainly manages to carry an unlimited amount of firearms on his person</a>.

There are no visible magazines, integral magazines for guns the size of tonfas shouldn't have that much capacity, and she is never shown reloading. It could be a helical magazine, which would have the right shape and ammo capacity for the tonfas — except that such a design would leave little space for the firing and shell-ejection mechanism.

It feels a bit odd too considering how much ammo they can sometimes burn through to take down one Neuroi. What makes this especially glaring is that Charlotte, armed with a BAR, actually complains about her weapon's low capacity (even with a magazine extended to twice the capacity the real M1918 ever got) compared to the MG 42s most of the rest of the cast lug around, despite as above it not actually being an issue in the slightest.

It's final attack involves firing EVERYTHING at the enemy... and is known as <em>Endless Burn</em>.

Similar to this, we never see the Kill Jaguar reload its Vulcan Storm either.

</li><li> Also partially averted in one album, where Lucky Luke comes in reinforcements to a cavalry detachment (for once, the situation is inverted) attacked by indians.

He also fires at least two dozen rounds at the deadite in S-Mart from a lever action rifle at the end. Also, his chainsaw seems to never run out of fuel. Or need any fuel, for that matter. However when his shotgun fires both barrels, the camera switches away from Ash and a soft clicking sound is heard (which would still mean a very fast reload, especially for a man with only one hand).

At one point they even start shooting up an empty room. Just for the hell of it.

Some of this comes down to sloppy editing; Doc shoots a cowboy during the OK Corral gunfight once with his shotgun (having fired the first barrel into the air), but the scene's cut to show the same shooting twice from different angles. Moments later, however, Doc unholsters his pistols and fires seven shots into Billy Clanton, then immediately fires <em>fourteen</em> more at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> Ike Clanton trying to ambush him from behind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Equilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Equilibrium">Equilibrium</a></em> deals with this by having the main character have a mechanism under his sleeves that loads his pistols with new magazines. This does not explain how exactly the mechanism works however, or how many magazines it holds. He also has sort of elaborate decoy magazines, magazines on round bottoms that he tosses to the floor, runs out and shoots down several guards before dropping to the floor and slotting the magazines into his gun. Careful counting of shots along the hallway scene in which both the sleeve reload and the weighted weeble clips are used reveals at least 30 rounds per magazine are being fired all the way along. At best count, about 40 are fired before the first reload, possibly more.

In this sequence, he reloads at least once, and each magazine holds 7 shots, exactly as many as the real Desert Eagle in .50 AE holds. Later on, however, Cousin Avi gets the gun and fires 10 shots at a dog without a reload.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrossePointeBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrossePointeBlank">Grosse Pointe Blank</a></em> has this in abundance. Oddly, his lack of ammo then becomes very important in his brief stand-off with Grocer.

Almost every single one, with the exception of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiller">The Killer</a></em> - in that movie's final battle you see one of the main characters toss a magazine to the other so he can reload. The only time the guns <em>ever</em> seem to run out of ammunition is when it's somehow relevant to the plot. Woo has stated in interviews that showing a reload detracts from the action of a gunfight and he wonders why American film audiences are so obsessed with it. Correlates with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a>.

After a brief chase, the thug stops him to point out:
<div class="indent"><strong>Willie:</strong> Now, you got a .45 revolver that holds six bullets! Now, I counted at least twenty shots and you never reloaded! <br/><strong>Slammer:</strong> That's right.

This seems to apply in some form to every gun handed out in the film, but that Uzi and, fittingly, someone else's Micro-Uzi are the biggest offenders because of just how <em>much</em> ammo gets pumped through them without anyone ever touching the magazines.
</li><li> Almost averted in the '50s monster movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheGiantLeeches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheGiantLeeches">Attack of the Giant Leeches</a></em>, where we do see a character reload. <em>Almost</em>, because before and after reloading, he manages to fire off five shots from a double-barreled shotgun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> films. The scenes in the Matrix can be explained by the same logic that gives humans and programs super-strength and speed. In fact, the weird part is when they <em>do</em> run out of bullets, especially the Agents, who are literally a part of the environment, and have full support of the world-building program, so if anyone has a legit excuse to have infinite ammo, it should be them.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>: Neo fires a gatling gun from a helicopter for almost a minute. That's upwards of <em>six thousand</em> bullets at the rates those sorts of guns fire at.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">twins</a> seem to have a UMP45 with at least 200 rounds in its magazine, whereas the real-life counterpart has only 25.

</li><li> Played Straight and subverted (as are many, many other tropes) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">in the movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastActionHero">Last Action Hero</a></em>. When they are in the movie, everybody's shooting left and right without ever pausing to reload. When they exit the movie to real life, Arnie's character realizes things work differently: cars don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">blow up with little provocation</a>, and guns need reloading.

</li><li> Seymour's revolver in the film of the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleShopOfHorrors">Little Shop of Horrors</a></em> has at least 12 shots.
</li><li> Pretty notable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Constantine">Constantine</a></em>. Angela fires her gun consecutively 30 times without reloading, but her Smith and Wesson Model 6906 holds a total of 13 rounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em> was a big offender. Spooner never reloads any of the several pistols he uses throughout the movie, but even worse, he has a submachine gun that gets a <em>lot</em> of use toward the end. By 2035, apparently bullets are infinite.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em>, the bartender fires 8 shots from his double-barreled shotgun before ducking to reload. Given that the movie is both a parody of, and tribute to police and action flicks, this may have been intentional.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious2001">The Fast and the Furious (2001)</a></em>, the villain fires way more rounds than the submachine gun he's carrying can hold in a magazine during the final chase scene. Furthermore, he's doing so while riding a motorcycle, giving him no realistically-conceivable means of reloading. When they destroy Brian's Eclipse, each of their submachine guns fires like an anti-materiel machine gun, about 150-200 rounds of API ammo each. After so many rounds, any machine gun with one barrel would have gone white hot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em>
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em>, no one ever reloads unless it's plot important. The Steyr AUG has a magazine capacity of 30, and the bad guy fires constantly for minutes. On the other hand, it was one of the first action movies to have the characters carrying spare magazines as a matter of course.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHardWithAVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHardWithAVengeance">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></em>, the security guard in the bank vault fires his shotgun about 15 times before coming up empty, nearly twice as many shells as a typical law-enforcement model can hold.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor version of this happens with the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981"> Halloween II (1981)</a></em>. In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">Halloween (1978)</a></em>, Dr. Loomis shoots Michael Myers once with a six-cylinder revolver, then after Myers staggers back a few steps, Loomis takes aim and fires the other five bullets in his gun, causing Myers to fall off a balcony to the ground below. However, the scene where Michael is shot and falls off the balcony was re-shot for the second film, leading to two rather glaring continuity errors: the balcony looks completely different than the first film's, and Loomis shoots Myers with <em>six</em> bullets instead of five following that initial shot. Which mean that, instead of shooting him "six times", as Loomis claims, he actually shot him <em>seven times</em>.

When he reloads it with a tracking bullet a while later he doesn't remove any shell casings. He shoots it more than four times while fighting the tooth fairies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a></em> as well.

</li></ul></li><li> Occurs twice when Lana Ravine is firing her revolver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalInstinct">Fatal Instinct</a></em>: when she's at the firing range and when she's shooting Max Shady.

Tillie whips out what looks to be a standard revolver, and fires about 20 shots from it.
</li><li> In the 1939 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach">Stagecoach</a></em>, during the final chase scene, nearly every male riding the stagecoach has a Winchester or revolver, and are shooting them as fast as possible, but none of them are shown reloading them (the Native Americans, on the other hand, sometimes have to reload theirs). Then suddenly, without warning, they're out of ammo and about to be overrun (before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a> saves them).
</li><li> In <em>Undead</em>, the police officer's revolver fires a rather obscene amount of rounds in the first gunfight.
</li><li> <em>Komodo vs Cobra</em>, an already remarkably bad movie with technical mistakes every few seconds, <em>really</em> goes to town with this. The .45 semi-auto pistols (which are misidentified by multiple characters as .38 revolvers, somehow) have apparently infinite ammo. There's one scene where a character fired one gun around 45 times, and another scene where he had one gun in each hand and fired at least 60 times total. Note that they never stocked up on ammo when they were at their base, nor did the movie ever show them re-loading between action scenes, let alone during them. Combining this with the two titular beasties somehow being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a> they might as well have called them the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreUseless">loud flash-toys</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackDynamite">Black Dynamite</a></em>. The titular character regularly fires upwards of 10 shots from his six shot revolver. Of course, this is probably on purpose.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpTigerLily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpTigerLily">What's Up, Tiger Lily?</a></em> (and referencing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>) — when the hero is in a shootout and runs out of ammo, he tells us "If all you people in the audience who believe in fairies clap your hands, my gun will be magically full of bullets!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> 47 loads a pair of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MP5">MP5s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (30 rounds per magazine) and proceeds to slaughter a room of baddies without ever stopping to reload (you know there weren't any reloads off screen, because 47 was frisked when he entered the room).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RamboIV">Rambo IV</a></em>, Sly opens up on the bad guys with a fifty-cal machine gun mounted on a small jeep. He keeps it up for a while, far longer than a single belt could possibly allow. It does eventually run out, but not before shooting a lot more rounds than a small jeep would reasonably carry (.50 BMGs are <em>big</em>). And then he <em>reloads</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeNinjas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeNinjas">3 Ninjas</a></em>, the boys' father leading the FBI force fired 9 shots from a revolver at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">crime syndicate</a> escaping on a helicopter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982">The Thing (1982)</a></em> Blair fires seven shots from a six shot revolver without reloading.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987">RoboCop (1987)</a></em> plays with this trope. Although the film features plenty of gunplay, characters are seen to reload. However the title character, while tending to fire short, controlled bursts, expends a lot more bullets than is possible for the size of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">admittedly oversized Auto-9</a> before returning it to his leg holster <em>at the end of any given engagement</em>, and is never seen performing a reload action during combat at all. Additionally, the ED-209 robot appears to carry more ammunition than a fighter plane; in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisastrousDemonstration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisastrousDemonstration">Disastrous Demonstration</a> it empties three 20mm cannon into a hapless executive for nigh-on half a minute.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2">RoboCop 2</a></em>, RoboCain's rampage includes his firing hundreds if not thousands of rounds from his built-in rotary gun- far more than he could be carrying.
</li><li> They tried to avert it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em> with the fighter jets running out of missiles, but then they had the pilots "plough the road" with a seemingly endless supply of bullets from their gatling cannons. One wonders why they used their precious supply of missiles to shoot down alien fighters when machine guns were just as effective. In real life, fighter jets carry enough rounds for less than ten seconds of continuous fire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereEaglesDare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereEaglesDare">Where Eagles Dare</a>,</em> Clint Eastwood's character fires an MP 40 submachine gun minute after minute, never once reloading for a quarter of the movie. Since there are no convenient ammo trucks following him around, the ammo fairy must be helping out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightTrainToMunich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightTrainToMunich">Night Train to Munich</a>,</em> Randall fires a revolver more than six times, and then arbitrarily runs out of bullets at the most dramatic time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Battleship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Battleship">Battleship</a>,</em> the <em>USS Missouri</em> is shown firing several rounds from her main guns, before switching to Alex Hopper yelling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">"Reload! Reload!"</a> The big 16" guns on an <em>Iowa</em>-class battleship max out at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ussnewjersey.com/hist_sts.htm">two rounds per gun per minute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There is no such thing as an automatic 16 inch cannon, they have to be reloaded after every shot.
</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> both plays this straight and subverts it. In the attack on Klendathu most of the MI's guns fire continuously without needing to reload, but in the battle in Whiskey Outpost later in the film they start running low on ammo. Keep in mind this is after around four minutes of almost continuous firing, long enough for the bugs to be able to start <em>crawling up to the top of the outpost's walls on piles of their dead.</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carriers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carriers">Carriers</a></em>, Chris Pine's character is seen to use his gun to shoot a Christian couple in a car an abnormally large amount of times without any sign of reloading. He also uses the gun multiple other times throughout the film, and given the scenario (post-apocalyptic disease-ridden society) it is unlikely he would have any other ammo than the bullets in the gun handy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface (1983)</a></em> has loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">guns on full auto</a>, and most of them seem to have nigh-unlimited ammo. Micro Uzis always keep blazing like miniguns. The final shootout takes it to ridiculous extremes. Tony's M16 has two magazines Jungle-Style'd together, but it certainly goes through more than 60 rounds before Tony has to reload. And he has to reload twice. Not to mention the countless bullets pumped into him which barely get him to stumble, let alone kill him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One single shot from a double-barrel shotgun finally does.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillain">The Villain</a></em>, Arnie's character Hansum Stranger has a <em>seven</em> shot revolver which otherwise looks like an ordinary gun. When Cactus Jack, disguised as a preacher, fires six rounds, he then waves the gun around thinking that it's empty. Then, he pulls the trigger, spooking the horse hitched to the buckboard he's standing on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> Particularly evident during the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld2003">Underworld (2003)</a></em> series, Selene <em>can</em> occasionally be seen reloading. She does however, fire far bullets than her guns could hold. The scene involving the escape via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHoleDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHoleDoor">Bullet Hole Door</a> is one of the worst (Best?!) examples out there as she fires what must be far more bullets than the mass of her berettas.<a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Underworld">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Why these guns even have a fully automatic mode is odd, since an extended clip won't last long. (not that she had extended clips...)
</li><li> Noticeably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em> with reloading scenes or magazines running empty. An exception is the parking garage chase where sloppy editing caused Arnold to fire numerous times from a pump-action shotgun without racking the slide or inserting more shells (or driving). Also it's not clear where Kyle Reese got the spare shells to reload his shotgun, since he is not shown taking any spare ammo when he steals it from the police cruiser early in the film. One must assume that at some point between then and the shootout at the Tech Noir, Reese must have found some way to acquire more ammo, perhaps by stealing it from a sporting goods store.
</li><li> Both Arnie and the T-1000 are shown reloading in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>, but for Arnie that just raises the fridge logic of where he got the spare shotgun shells.

There's also the stunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">"One Shot Left"</a>, which lets a character who has it make <em>one</em> attack at a significant bonus by declaring it to be his or her last shot...but then he or she definitely <em>is</em> out of ammo for any and all of his or her weapons until further notice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fudge">Fudge</a></em> games, players don't keep track of ammo, instead the GM declares that they've run out whenever it is most dramatic.
</li><li> Most guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> fire flechettes or electromagnetically accelerated projectiles small enough that you can in essence hold an infinite quantity of ammo on your person; the recommended rule is to ignore total ammunition entirely and only make players pay attention to the magazines, which need to be switched out when they're empty and can prevent certain firing patterns when they're partially depleted.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Battle Armor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> only track ammunition for missile weapons under normal game rules. Typically, this isn't a huge issue as most Battle Armor carry a couple dozen shots for most ballistic weapons and if they're out in the open making shots for more than six rounds it typically indicates that either the enemy forces are being routed or the squad is about to get splattered by artillery or a Battlemech.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles">Mutant Chronicles</a></em> 3rd edition. You can buy reloads for your guns, but the only time you use them is when the player rolls badly enough to get a Reload result, or the storyteller spends Dark Symmetry Points to force a Reload, or for special maneuvers that increase the damage and the chance to hit, like fully automatic fire. Otherwise all guns have bottomless magazines.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantYearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantYearZero">Mutant: Year Zero</a></em>, Scrap and Breach-loading firearms only have one shot per round and can only be reloaded on move turns. Weapon artifacts that have any sort of multi-bullet chamber or magazine do not have to be reloaded at all, as the game assumes you reload outside of combat.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a>s had a form of this without the infinite ammo - you still have a limited amount, but as long as you have any, you never actually have to load it into your gun to shoot it. Some weapons do have a "reload" animation of sorts, however; <em>Doom</em>'s shotgun has to be cocked between shots (this continued to be the standard for video-game shotguns even for a while after games otherwise started acknowledging the need to reload), and <em>Doom 2</em>'s double-barreled shotgun has to be manually reloaded each time. A few games from that era were actually notable for having a <em>single</em> weapon that did have to be reloaded after a certain number of shots (see under Exceptions).
</li><li> Although most modern FPS games do require you to reload your guns, some feature unrealistically large magazines, allowing you to fire for a prolonged period of time before needing to reload. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, for example, the assault rifle loads 60 rounds of 7.62mm FMJ ammo, which would make the mag <em>much</em> larger than it actually appears in-game; its replacement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> dropped it down to a more reasonable (but still too large for its size) 32, and then the DMR in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> only fits 15 rounds in mags of the same size. Also see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Black" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Black">Black</a></em>, where the M4 Carbine had an unrealistically large mag size of 70 rounds (despite being a standard 30 round mag in appearance). Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">it was admitted by one of the artists</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">visual style and aesthetics were prioritized over accurate depictions</a>. Also <em>also</em> see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em>, which features an assault rifle toting a 100-round mag. It may be noticeably larger than normal, but it's still far too small to hold that much ammo.
<ul><li> However, the minute you give a friendly your gun, they suddenly have an untold amount of ammo for it, regardless of what they were carrying before. If you take it back after they've used it a bit, it'll have the same amount of ammo it had when you gave it to them. This is particularly useful with a rocket launcher. Wait until you have one, trade it off, and keep the rocket guy alive for more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>. Enemies, naturally, also have this, able to unload an endless stream of bullets at you - of course, once you kill them and scavenge their corpse for ammo, you'll at most find one or two mags on him.
</li><li> One consistently strange example as well is that in video games, guns will generally have an ammo count based on what players expect that sort of gun to carry, rather than what the real thing is capable of carrying. Assault rifles, for instance, will almost always carry 30 rounds per magazine, even when the real weapon is nine times out of ten modeled with smaller magazines (the SIG SG 550 series) or doesn't <em>have</em> magazines that hold that many (FAMAS F1); also see most pump-action shotguns in modern video games, which will almost always carry a minimum of 8 shells at a time even when modeled with a shell tube that couldn't possibly carry that many, and will typically only get realistic lowered capacities if that's the game's way of balancing having more than one shotgun.
</li></ul></li><li> An enormous amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy">Real-Time Strategy</a> games use this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">since managing ammo and a battlefield would be far too hectic</a>.
</li><li> Pretty much any and every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG">Eastern RPG</a> character who uses a bow, gun, or other ranged weapon will play this trope to the hilt.
<ul><li> One notable exception is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, where any bow-wielding character must have arrows to fire (mostly to allow you to use different ammunition). In the DS remake, you only had to buy one generic arrow-type item, which was indeed bottomless, carried over from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> 's ammo system.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>, all firearms are loaded with Quicksilver Bullets, a type of mercury bullets infused with a hunter's blood, the hunters can also use their own blood as makeshift ammo. While there is a capacity of how many ammo you can carry, you don't have to reload your guns regardless the fact that they are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">break-action guns</a></em>. The only time you see a hunter reloading their guns is when Father Gascoigne reload his own Hunter Pistol, which fires blunderbuss rounds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>, all enemies and friendly NPC's have infinite ammo, though Ellie stops having infinite ammo whenever there is a section where she is controlled by the player. There is also a section where Joel takes control of a sniper rifle with infinite ammo.
</li><li> If you use Munitions attacks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>, while in theory your ammunition only lasts as long as your energy does... the Munitions Energy Builder attack requires you fire <em>even more</em> bullets to charge it back up again.
</li><li> This is par for the course for any mounted gun emplacement in a video game. Think of the damage you could do if there was a way to unbolt one from its perch and carry it with you. Unfortunately, most developers <em>have</em> thought of that, so in more modern games in which you <em>can</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableTurretGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableTurretGun">carry the turret with you</a>, they tend to lose their infinite ammo when you do so.
</li><li> Many shooter games (this is standard for games that use a light-gun) also invert this trope with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">weakest gun</a>: You'll have unlimited <em>reserve</em> ammo and can reload as many times as you like, but your magazine will only hold so many rounds and have to be reloaded periodically.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2">Just Cause 2</a></em>, detachable mounted guns are found in most bases and have limitless ammo, detached or otherwise. On top of that, the mounted guns destroy pretty much anything that creates chaos when blown up in about two seconds flat; finding a mounted gun makes most stronghold takeover missions a breeze. More Dakka indeed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>: If you couldn't pump out a constant stream of handgun bullets, it just wouldn't be the same. In fact, it loves this trope so much that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waves</a> it, saying that one of Dante's powers is to create ammunition inside his guns.
<ul><li> It loves it so much because of an intentional decision Hideki Kamiya made for the original game; he has stated that he wanted to keep the action of the game as fast as possible, and forcing the character to stop and reload would only slow things down.
</li><li> <em>DMC4</em>'s Nero needs to reload his revolver and spends a good few seconds in a cutscene pulling off a slo-mo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload">Unorthodox Reload</a>; but in regular gameplay, you can keep firing as long as you want, only when you stop will Nero flick his wrist, presumably reloading it at super human speeds. Partly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DevilMayCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DevilMayCry5">Devil May Cry 5</a></em>, where he has to load in bullets for charged shots.
</li><li> Lady is a peculiar case; although she is shown reloading her small arms regularly, she seems to carry more magazines that should be possible, while she is never seen reloading her "Kalina Ann" rocket launcher.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiepIo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiepIo">diep.io</a></em> has a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example: <em>none</em> of the tanks ever run out of ammo.
<ul><li> The Overseer branch can only have a set amount of drones (usually 8), but have an unlimited amount waiting to come into battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em>, already famous for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual-Dual Wielding</a> of guns which are allegedly repeaters in the hands and feet, uses this like <em>Devil May Cry</em>. Made funnier by the fact that nobody is sure where the magazine is.
<ul><li> A post-boss fight cutscene shows her loading in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her lipstick to shoot Balder</span>, the barrels being in the double-barrel shotgun configuration. Her primary guns <em>don't have any magazines</em>.
</li><li> It takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">a bit of digging</a>, but the game explains the lack of magazines: her custom guns don't have any magazines because she's making the bullets out of her spirit power channeled through the gemstone built into the gun, and they're being placed directly into the chamber without the need for storage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em>, much like its companion anime. Beyond the Grave's dual "Cerberus" handguns can be fired as much as you want without ever having to touch the magazines, so much so that the games never even make it apparent <em>where</em> the magazine is (it slides in underneath the barrel like a shotgun tube according to the anime). His coffin's special attacks do have a limit, however, but even though they still involve physical projectiles, you never need to do any more to replenish them than just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessMeter">killing a lot of people in a short enough time</a>.
</li><li> Up until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">IV</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series used this with pump-action shotguns, presumably to compensate for the slow firing speed.
<ul><li> While SMGs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">III</a></em> onward normally have to be reloaded after a certain number of shots like the other non-shotgun weapons, if their mag is emptied while the player is firing from a vehicle, more ammo is just immediately transported from their supply back into the gun so they can continue shooting. This also comes with the caveat of a half-empty magazine immediately refilling itself when the player switches their view, e.g. looking out the left-side window after having shot out from the right.
</li></ul></li><li> Played shamelessly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon">Hellgate: London</a></em>, where firearms never run out of ammo. The ammo? Well, that's an attachment in this game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletWitch">Bullet Witch</a></em> intentionally uses a variant of this trope. One of the powers the lead character possesses is to convert part of her constantly-regenerating supply of MP into more bullets or shells for her gun. She can't fire forever without reloading, but she can reload forever.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> series has a protagonist whose main firearm is powered by sunlight. Give him some sunscreen and he can literally shoot all day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>
<ul><li> The rocket launcher is usually the most powerful weapon a player can obtain in these games, but you usually only have one shot at a time. Most of the games, however, have some way to unlock one with unlimited ammo. Never easily, of course - for example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you have to finish the game in under five hours, much easier said than done.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Resident Evil  Code: Veronica</a></em>. The protagonist hands her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a> <em>empty</em> twin Ingram MAC-11s. A cutscene slightly later involves handing him a <em>single</em> magazine. He can keep blasting (in game and during cut-scenes) literally hundreds of bullets from both guns, up until a pivotal cutscene takes place (a cutscene which involves Steve firing both MAC-11s until they run out of ammo at the same time — despite the fact that 15 seconds earlier, he shoots a wall with a long burst with only one gun). To top it off, he'll still fire in both cutscenes even if the player drains the guns of ammo during the playable Steve sequence, with only his first line at the end of said sequence acknowledging whether he actually still has ammo or not.
</li><li> Likewise, once you clear the game and unlock the Survivors mini-game, you can fire Steve's twin MAC-11s for almost 30 continuous seconds before they run out, despite the fact that a MAC-11 empties a full magazine (32 rounds) in just under two seconds.
</li><li> Even more amusing are Steve's Gold Lugers. Claire actually finds them first, with no ammo in them. Then Steve takes them. Later on, Steve rescues Claire by going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a> with the Gold Lugers, then trading them back to you - with no ammo. Not only that, but there's no ammo for them in <em>the entire game</em> — their use is strictly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor">place into a door so it unlocks</a>. To add insult to injury, he actually complains that you "tricked him" since the MAC-11s have no ammo, then makes <em>you</em> grab that single magazine for him (though Claire gets back at him for this by making him act as a stepping stool to reach it).
</li><li> If you start <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em> on Easy Mode, you start with a fully loaded M4A1 and a single magazine — which contain <em>300 rounds, <strong>each</strong></em>. Combined, that gives you enough bullets to reach the second half of the game before they run out, provided that you use other weapons to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Nemesis</a>. And on that note, defeating the Nemesis in every optional fight makes him drop an attachment that allows you to give a single gun infinite ammunition.
<ul><li> Fully-automatic weapons in general up to <em>Code Veronica</em>, including the above M4, another MAC-11 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">2</a></em>, and the AK in <em>CV</em>, are given a percentage-based ammunition system rather than tracking specific numbers of bullets, with the games varying in how many bullets make up each percentage but generally going for at least three, or at least 300 bullets per magazine that should hold around 30. This is typically made up for with A) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">Arbitrary Gun Power</a> making them much weaker than just plinking away with your starting handgun (or blowing their heads off with the resident Magnum), and B) very little spare ammo for when you eventually run out (each game that follows this system has a single spare magazine for their respective automatic, <em>2</em>'s MAC-11 only available if you leave it until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">B scenario</a>, <em>3</em> starting you with one extra magazine for the M4, and <em>CV</em>'s AK only getting a half-full mag in the second half of the game).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> &amp; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">5</a></em> start the player off with reasonable, though a bit high, magazine sizes. The upgrade system plays this straight, eventually allowing your small handgun to hold 50+ bullets per mag, twelve rounds in a revolver, or <em>one hundred</em> shells in a shotgun - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">fully reloaded by just putting two more in</a>. Don't forget about the infinite rocket launcher you can buy after defeating the game once.
</li><li> In <em>4</em> and <em>5</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handcannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handcannon">Handcannon</a> can also be upgraded to have infinite ammo. However, prior to getting its Exclusive upgrade that grants it unlimited ammunition, the Handcannon's ammo is <em>very</em> rare. <em>5</em> goes even further, in that you can do this with <em>any</em> gun.
<ul><li> Played completely to trope in <em>4</em> with the Chicago Typewriter (a Thompson submachine gun). Amusingly, it does have a reload animation which doesn't do anything at all, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">look awesome</a>, moreso with Leon's unlockable mobster costume.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilTheUmbrellaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilTheUmbrellaChronicles">Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilTheDarksideChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilTheDarksideChronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a></em>, being rail-shooters, gives the player's starting pistols infinite ammunition, on top of an upgrade system that lets guns hold increasingly-ridiculous amounts of ammo. In addition, counter-attacks can be used as many times as the prompt appears for the player, even if they look to take up some sort of resource — like Chris's counter-attack, wherein he jabs a knife into the attacker's head before kicking it away, without taking back the knife,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3cjdg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3cjdg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3cjdg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This in contrast to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> REmake, which introduced weapons used for counterattacks like these knives, but very explicitly required you to actually <em>have</em> one on your person to use them and did, in fact, take one away when you used it for a counterattack</span> or Rebecca's, wherein she pushes the offending zombie away and then blows it up with a <em>grenade</em>, without requiring any grenades in your inventory or taking one away if you do have any.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stranglehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stranglehold">Stranglehold</a></em> plays this in the same manner as classic first-person shooters — as long as your gun has ammo, you can fire continuously without stopping to reload. In fact, the only time Tequila reloads is when he's gearing up to unleash a Barrage attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Bill Blasters from the series games, which can fire an unlimited number of Bullet Bills. Adding to this is the fact that the Bills are approximately the same size as their Blasters. This is also true with Lakitus, especially in the early years where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny">their Spinies</a> are all the same size as their butts, which in turn are the same size as the Lakitus themselves, as with the Hammer Bros., which can throw an unlimited supply of hammers.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>. A character complains that her guidebook on a hammer-throwing enemy tells you everything except where they get the infinite supply of hammers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> does play this straight but still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it with the Patriot, a gun you obtain after beating the game once. When you call up your tech specialist over the radio, he asks how it never runs out of ammo or needs to be reloaded. Snake's answer: "Because the internal feed mechanism is shaped like an infinity symbol." It apparently explains the whole thing adequately.
<ul><li> There's also the on-rails action against the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shagohod</span> where you do get unlimited ammo of whatever weapons you had at the moment. The explanation is that the sidecar of the motorcycle that you're riding in has lots of ammunition in it. Which gets more than a little ridiculous when you start using the RPG and quick reload (equipping and unequipping weaponry, a bit of bizarre MGS-logic).
<ul><li> Taken to the extreme with the unlockable "Infinity" face-paint, which, as its name suggests, gives Snake infinite ammo for as long as he has it applied. One camo pattern for his uniform unlocked by beating the game once does the same for his battery-powered items.

In Snake's fight with Olga she regularly has to reload her USP, but never seems to run out of spare magazines... until you defeat her and take her USP for yourself, of course, at which point you will not find any ammo for it until you've gone far enough away that the game will remove her unconscious body from the arena.

However, wait after firing a certain number (or more) of shots (9 for the male characters, who have automatics, and 6 for the revolver-packing girls), and your character will yank the magazine out and replace it. Not that they <em>need</em> to, but the animators just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">felt like paying attention to that detail</a>.

It's not <em>technically</em> infinite ammo, but it can take <em>days</em> for gunfighters to run dry. This is a plot point in one of Wrex's stories—he mentions that he once fought an opposing bounty hunter for so long, they both ran out of ammo and had to scrounge up guns from other hunters Wrex had killed during the gunfight.
<ul><li> There is a mechanic that serves a similar purpose to limited ammo magazines in the game, though; each gun has a limited number of shots it can fire before the weapon will overheat on you. Lay on the trigger too much and you'll have to wait a short time before you can fire again, analogous to a mag swap.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">The sequel</a> retains the bottomless magazines (you never run out of ammo), but adds reloading by forcing the player to swap out thermal clips, the justification being that troops having to wait for the weapons to cool down in the middle of a battle makes them vulnerable (the question of what happens when the troop runs out of thermal clips is not addressed). Note that these "clips" are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">Universal Ammunition</a> and they restock all of your carried weapons simultaneously when picked up, with the exception of the heavy one.

All other weapons in the game are either heavy weapons which can't be restocked or need thermal clips to function.
</li><li> The <em>Citadel DLC</em> has Shepard find an old M7 Lancer from around the time of the First Contact War, which still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">relies on the old cooling system</a> method. After running out of shots, Shepard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">goes to reload</a>, only to realise it doesn't use thermal clips and nearly burns themselves as a result. It's also explained that adding the system of quick-replacable thermal clips to weapons in <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> required removal of their prior cooling systems, which leads to one character complaining that the system is a step backwards.

With it active, while weapons with heat gauges still overheat and your thrown/set explosives are still limited, actual ammunition otherwise lasts forever, even for single-shot weapons like the RPG-7 and grenade launchers.
</li><li> <em>World at War</em> does something similar with the flamethrower, which never runs out of fuel, but has a heat gauge that fills continuously while the trigger is held. The secondary part of this trope is also played straight in the mission "Black Cats". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">The ammo for your PBY Catalina's various gun turrets runs out</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">just in time for the Corsairs to show up</a>.
</li><li> The multiplayer modes for most of the games from <em>World at War</em> onwards allow the player to attach extended magazines to their weapons to get a little more ammo. With the exception of <em>World at War</em> itself, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Black Ops</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4b718');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4b718" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4b718');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and even here there are exceptions like the M14; there's also the corollary that weapons like the M16 will hold 30 rounds in a 20-round mag by default to facilitate the model-change</span>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Black Ops III</a></em>, the weapon model will not change to account for this, and the player instead somehow stuffs up to half an extra magazine's contents into an already-full one. Singleplayer will also generally give a handful of weapons greater mag capacities than they have in multiplayer; the first mission played as Ramirez in <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, in particular, gives you a SCAR-H that holds 30 rounds in its 20-round magazine, and which also has an underbarrel shotgun attached that fits 7 shells into a shortened mag tube that barely holds three.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> does this... but with good reason.

You have to reload, but you never run out spare magazines or ammo, ever. Since you frequently jump from body to body, and thus wouldn't be able to keep track of ammo anyway for a significant amount of time, it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> is another classic example. In almost all of the games, Lara's basic pistols have infinite ammo and never have to reload. Her other guns, while having limited ammo, never needs a fresh magazine. The harpoon gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and crossbow all need to be reloaded. Not to mention that all gunmen enemies Lara faces also have infinite ammo.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend">Legend</a></em>, the infinite-ammo pistols have a set magazine size, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">slow-mo flip attack</a> overrides this, allowing her to fire non-stop until she lands.

In order from least to most ridiculous: Ina with her bow, Masamune with his pistols, Magoichi with his musket/rifle(/shotgun), Goemon with his backpack cannon, and Ieyasu with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine">cannon-spear</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranadoEspada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranadoEspada">Granado Espada</a></em> uses it too. Of course, it is done for class balance, but there is something funny about the musketeer class using the skill "Covering Fire", which shoots 20 rounds in full-automatic mode — from a front-loading matchlock rifle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1942">Battlefield 1942</a></em>, this is treated oddly. Guns have limited magazines, and soldiers carry no more than 3 grenades, but suitcase-sized boxes contain infinite amounts of ammo. Whether a weapon is used by Americans, Brits, Canadians, Soviets, Germans, or the Japanese, it can be reloaded from any ammo crate. Even worse: if, for example, an Allied soldier uses one of these crates to grenade spam, he will throw Mk 2 grenades. If the player picks up a weapon from a dead Axis soldier, he will start taking Stielhandgranates out of the same grenade crate and throwing them.
</li><li> <em>Battlefield 2</em> has the MEC Assault and Medic classes' AK-101, which has two magazines taped together. The reloading animation always consists of your character taking the current magazine out and flipping it over to load the other one - he never switches out those two magazines for a fresh pair. What makes it odd is that this <em>also</em> still counts as dropping the other magazine entirely and thus losing every bullet still in it, like with every other weapon in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JazzJackrabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JazzJackrabbit">Jazz Jackrabbit</a></em> games, your special weapons all have limited ammo, but the basic blaster you start out with has no limits (indicated, appropriately enough, by an Infinity sign in the ammo meter).
</li><li> Pick the Assault Rifle powerset in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> and blast away. Even using Full Auto doesn't empty your mag. Of course, this gun is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">SMGsniperrifleshotgungrenadelauncherflamethrowermachinegun</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">disappears when you're not using it</a>. Same deal with Archery and Trick Archery, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Dual Pistol</a> powerset.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>, your pistols' magazines have finite bullets, but the magazines themselves are infinite. Other weapons can eventually run out of ammo, but there are strategically placed ammo piles lying around that you can use to reload nearly any of the guns you find as many times as you need. Such piles are spaced out farther in the sequel, however, so running out of ammo is a much more common occurrence, unless you're using pistols or melee weapons to save ammo or swapping primary weapons regularly. Also, some weapons have unusually-higher round capacities than depicted in the player models (both the Uzi and Assault Rifle in the first game hold 50 rounds in magazines that should hold about 30, for instance).
<ul><li> And played perfectly straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Gib Fest</a> mutation; every player starts with an M60 LMG, with infinite ammo. Combine with boomer bile to get all the common infected in one spot, and, to quote another of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Valve's games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">"SO MUCH BLOOD! HA HA HA!"</a>
</li><li> In the same mode, there's a small chance that the AI director will glitch and spawn a Grenade Launcher (which it shouldn't, as the mode basically erases all weapons from the spawn table). Using it reveals that the Grenade Launcher was coded with a 1 shot-magazine, but was <em>never given a firing cooldown</em>. You can literally lob grenades at the speed of an assault rifle at zombies (the game mode removes reloading on primary weapons, as the M60 doesn't have a reload animation).
</li><li> Pistols were originally given ammo reserves, but Valve decided that running out of ammo on both your primary and secondary weapons and resorting to weakly shoving sprinting zombies was no fun. Similarly, melee weapons were originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">supposed to break</a> after a certain amount of hits, but it left you with a single pistol at the end so instead they became infinite-use. The Chainsaw is the sole exception to this, as it's so incredibly powerful that you can literally run with it on through the entire map if you had the ammo (and there is another mutation where this is the only weapon you have, with infinite fuel like Gib Fest).
</li><li> Mounted miniguns and heavy machine guns also have infinite ammo (despite the former using a small ammo box that would, at its rate of fire, empty itself in about four seconds), but they overheat so quickly and take so long to cool down (only the hordes from a finale will keep coming long enough for it to cool down before you've killed everything and moved on) that they may as well be limited.

Living infinite ammo weaponry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">"lovely"</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> and its Episodes have the fortuitous Infinite Ammunition Crates. Slightly believable for pistol and machine gun ammunition, for which they could reasonably contain a large amount, less so for crates of missiles that are also always placed near an enemy that can only be killed with explosives. Even less so for the absolutely tiny crate on the back of the dune buggy you use for "Highway 17", which is just as full of SMG ammo as the gigantic pre-placed crates before and after.
</li><li> <em>Half-Life 2</em> also has the infinitely throwable bugbait. The Vortigaunt that teaches you how to use it does explain throwing it as "tearing off a piece" of it, even if that's not what's actually happening on-screen.
</li><li> In the <em>HL1</em> mod <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfraidOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfraidOfMonsters">Afraid of Monsters</a>: Directors Cut</em>, obtaining all 4 endings gained a weapon that had a scope and infinite ammo. Considering most of the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights">freaking dark</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuzzleFlashlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuzzleFlashlight">Muzzle Flashlight</a> will be very handy. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryOfFear">Cry of Fear</a></em> likewise has an infinite-ammo assault rifle for beating Nightmare difficulty.
</li></ul></li><li> The sidequests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> where you need to destroy stuff and kill folks using only a specific weapon or vehicle give you unlimited ammo for the duration of the sidequest. At other times, though, there is a finite stock of ammunition.
<ul><li> Still, the basic machine gun has around 100 to 500 ammo (depends on upgrading gun handling knowledge) and the machine guns automatically become one hit kill weapons against basic human class enemies, but even they become useless later in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SepterraCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SepterraCore">Septerra Core</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaves</a> this by explaining that the guns use a fancy piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> to synthesize ammo from energy harvested from the rotation of the planet's seven world shells.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em>, some guns are equipped with a regenerating ammo stat, and one particular gun, The Dove, doesn't consume ammo at all, and requires no reload. This is lampshaded by the description for The Dove itself, which is "Sometimes I forget to reload..."
<ul><li> Some class abilities allow more ammo to be used than some guns can hold. In some cases this allows for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">five shotgun rounds to be used when normally two are loaded as well as sub-machinegun and assault rifles being able to hold as much as THOUSANDS of rounds.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, there is a Legendary pistol dubbed Infinity that literally has infinite ammo, and operates like The Dove, with no reload, hence the name. It even fires in an infinity shape!
</li><li> S&amp;S Munitions guns in <em>Borderlands 1</em> and Bandit guns in <em>2</em> also have their manufacturer gimmick being having <em>huge</em> magazines — an average Bandit submachinegun can have as much as 120 bullets per clip.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em> has the Children of the Vault guns, the latest incarnation of Bandit guns, which don't use magazines and fire directly out of your ammo reserve. To keep the game balanced, they build up heat as you fire them; if you hold the trigger too long, which typically happens after firing 50-70 pistol/rifle bullets, they will overheat.
</li></ul></li><li> Ballistic missile launchers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> games, like the GLA Scud launchers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerGenerals">Generals</a></em> and Soviet V3 Rockets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em>, are basically a rocket on a truck, visible all the time. A new missile magically appears in the launcher after every shot. <em>C&amp;C</em>'s fliers typically have an ammo limit that requires a regular return to an airbase for reloads, but ground units are almost always unlimited.
<ul><li> Lest we forget, helicopters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">the original game</a> would fire a salvo of rockets, wait a bit to reload, and then fire another salvo of rockets. Endlessly.
</li><li> C Lore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaves</a> this; all weapons systems make their own ammo.
</li><li> And then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Renegade</a></em> averts this for infantry firearms, requiring a reload and limited by reserve ammo, but the pistol has a limited mag with infinite reserve (a la the later Left 4 Dead). Vehicles still play this straight; even the Orcas/Helicopters have infinite ammo now.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>, every weapon can and will be fired continuously for as long as required without ever depleting its ammunition. This is slightly more reasonable for Imperial Guard laser weaponry or Necron gauss weaponry, less so for the others. In <em>Dawn of War 2</em> nearly every unit performs a brief reload animation after every dozen-or-so shots, averting one part of this trope, but that simply raises the question of where they get all those magazines.
<ul><li> Perfectly justified for the Orkz, whose gear runs entirely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> lampshaded this trope. One of the unlockable bonus cheat modes was called 'American Movie Mode', which gave unlimited ammo (and had the enemy soldiers speak English instead of German).
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorVanguard">Medal of Honor: Vanguard</a></em>, The MG42 has one when the player uses it but surprisingly, when the enemies use it they have to reload occasionally, allied soldiers will even tell the player when the enemy with the MG42 is reloading.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a></em>, YOU can only use firearms a certain number of times before they are destroyed. But anyone else can use a firearm infinitely.
</li><li> In the MMO Third Person Shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League">S4 League</a></em>, most of the shooting weapons have limited magazine sizes but unlimited ammo reserves. Justified because it takes place in a virtual setting where ammo is unlimited because the designer said so.
</li><li> Hunters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> needed ammo in the earlier days for their ranged weapons; having a quiver (for arrows) or pouch (for guns) increased reload speed. The "Cataclysm" expansion changed ranged weapons to no longer need ammo, though if you had a quiver or pouch on your person (they've turned into normal bags) beforehand, it will still display. The "Mists of Pandara" expansion goes one step further and strips out the differences between ranged and melee weapons.
</li><li> The Terran marines of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> carry gauss rifles with magazines that must stretch all the way into hyperspace and back, since they can keep holding down the trigger and shooting things forever on full-auto without ever having to reload. And as we see in the cinematics, they are shooting <em>big</em> bullets. However, a couple of these cinematics avert the trope. Secondary material suggests the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom">giant shoulderpads</a> are for ammo storage. More mystifying is how missile-bearing units such as the Goliath never run out — or, for that matter, how hydralisks never run out of venomous spines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDishwasher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDishwasher">The Dishwasher</a></em> gets "The Arsenal" in the first game while both the Dishwasher and Yuki get an SMG and a Gatling arm in the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">with limited effectiveness in most situations.</a> They later get far more effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">shotguns</a>. Both weapons (which The Arsenal consists of) can be reloaded as much as you want, with the character ejecting the old mag/shell, with the new magazine magically showing up as soon as the old one hits the ground.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> allows you to unlock infinite ammo for different weapon types by completing diversions, on top of the weapons usually holding more bullets than their real-world counterparts would be able to (the most extreme examples being some shotguns, a double-barreled one holding six shells and a concealed cane-shotgun that should only hold one or two gets <em>sixteen</em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> and beyond instead makes this an ability you can unlock at the maximum respect rank, and also has slightly-earlier upgrades that let you skip reloading entirely for weapons of specific types. There are also certain sections where you are given guns with infinite ammo, mainly during intense action sequences.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">Bianca</a>, Varric's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbow">Automatic Crossbow</a> can fire off hundreds of arrows without ever needing to be reloaded. Interestingly, in cutscenes, on two separate occasions, Varric is shown retrieving a single arrow, even after he's already fired off enough to equip a small army.
<ul><li> <em>Dragon Age</em> in general, really. In <em>Origins</em>, you can equip special, magical arrows that have limited ammo, but once those run out you just go back to firing normal ones without end. In <em>Inquisition</em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Ke2DTTs81g0?t=12m33s">this gets lampshaded<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Dorian:</strong> Where do you get all your arrows, Sera? You have... hundreds. <br/><strong>Sera:</strong> From your arse, that's where. <br/><strong>Dorian:</strong> My arse should open up a shop. It's apparently quite prolific.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em> has two bows that have a built-in bottomless supply of arrows - the Tansheron's Bow and the Bow of Gesen (and at least one sling). They can still be loaded with magical varieties of arrows with limited uses, though.
<ul><li> <em>The Throne of Bhaal</em> expansion also adds Infinite Quivers and Arrows, which can make any bow or sling into this. As well as the Firetooth Crossbow which has infinite bolts.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>'s Aperture Science Investment Opportunity trailer, with the turrets that shoot endless streams of bullets.

</div></li><li> Unlike other Wargaming titles, the ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarships">Worldof Warships</a></em> have unlimited ammunition in their magazines. According to the developers, this is because ships hold so much ammo that they actually could not expend it all over the course of a match so they didn't bother. Remember real naval battles take place over hours of not days rather that minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em> have <a class="urllink" href="http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/Blaster_%28Q2%29">the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/Blaster_%28Q4%29">blaster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an energy pistol with infinite ammunition. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">rarely useful</a>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> onward; when making a custom multiplayer/firefight mode, in setting character weapon traits, there are two kinds of infinite ammo: vanilla (infinite extra mags), and this trope. The second option also turns off the "overheat" mechanic of plasma weapons or turrets. It can play merry hell with aiming reticles.
</li><li> Every single incarnation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BangaiO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BangaiO">Bangai-O</a></em> never runs out of missiles to fire, even while using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb">EX Attacks</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestarGalacticaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestarGalacticaOnline">Battlestar Galactica Online</a></em> usually averts this but plays it straight with mining cannons. The downside is that they simply don't have the combat specs to compare with full military-use guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4">SWAT 4</a></em> averts this for human players and AI-controlled squadmates, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAIIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAIIsACheatingBastard">plays it completely straight for AI-controlled suspects</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em> averts this when players use Hybrid and Projectile turrets as well as Missile weapons. Laser turrets just feed off the ship capacitor, as regular "ammo crystals" don't break (the upgraded variants do though). Fortunately, combat ships all have enough cargo space that one can just carry nothing BUT ammo and usually never run out. Of course, the proportions on the ammunition are rather unrealistic, and the ammo is <em>One Size Fits All</em>, for example working all the way from Dual 425mm autocannons to 1400mm howitzer Artillery.
</li><li> In the original Xbox/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Black" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Black">Black</a></em>, after completing a level on multiple difficulties, you can unlock "Silver Weapons" which make the guns shinier, and invoke this trope. Which makes sense, when you start with a pistol or shotgun (Reloading Optional), but when you find a RPG mid-level, pick it up, and can turn anything breakable in the level broken, it turns it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li><li> The arcade <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> game gives all four playable characters infinite rounds for the guns they carry, and they can be powered up to fire even faster as long as you avoid getting hit.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series tend to have unlockable weapons that have infinite ammo and thus eliminates the need to reload. <em>Resident Evil 3</em> takes it a step further by allowing the player to actually find a briefcase filled with ammo during normal gameplay, which makes one weapon of your choosing have infinite ammo for the rest of the game.
</li><li> <em>M1 Tank Platoon</em>. Your M1 tanks each had only a limited number of rounds for their main guns. All other units (including other units on your side) had infinite ammo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Intrusion2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Intrusion2">Intrusion 2</a></em> so long as you have ammo weapons can be fired indefinitely, with the exception of the grenade launcher which automatically reloads after each shot.
</li><li> Happens with two Bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> (Not a shooter, because almost no-one uses guns, so the above rule really doesn't apply). The third Boss, Edi.E, uses a handgun when brought down to about half of his health, and has unlimited ammunition. The final boss, Belger, uses a crosbow, and never runs out of quarrels. (And unlike Edi.E, he can use it from the beginning of the fight.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>, Stryker's gun never needs reloading during a match. (But he is seen reloading it in one scene between fights during the Story Mode.)
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX">Mortal Kombat X</a></em>, Erron Black does this <em>with revolvers</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland">Dead Island</a></em> normally averts this trope and requires players to scavenge ammo for guns and keep track of their throwing weapons (which are usually just regular melee weapons that happen to be thrown at that moment), but Purna's special ability lets her use her personal sidearm with unlimited ammo for a limited time, and Logan's gives him unlimited throwing knives.
<ul><li> With enough investment in the upgrading system, you can make guns with <em>absolutely insane</em> amounts of bullets, to the point where it can be more than you could feasibly carry, let alone fit in the gun.
</li></ul></li><li> There is only one weapon out of many that use this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux">Dynamite Dux</a></em> - the water pistol, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">the only way to harm fire bosses</a>, thus justifying the trope. It doesn't really matter anyway, as the water pistols are lost shortly after the boss dies.
</li><li> Played straight with any pistol in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM</a></em> remake. Rifles and shotguns do need to reload... but have unlimited reloads. And not, this isn't just with energy weapons but with regular ballistic guns as well. The only weapons that run out of ammo are bazookas and fusion ball launchers.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> era <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedTactics">Turn-Based Tactics</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CallOfCthulhuTheWastedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CallOfCthulhuTheWastedLand">Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land</a></em> has all the characters having an infinite supplies of ammunitions and absolutely never had to reload them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em>, most weapons carry more ammo in their magazines than they should, even with you attaching extended versions to them. The <a class="urllink" href="http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Reinfeld_880">Reinfeld 880<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Locomotive_12G_%28Payday_2%29">Locomotive 12G<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shotguns are probably the most notable, as both get a pair of attachments that can increase the number of shells they hold at a time by two each. Those attachments are, respectively, a very small extension for the magazine tube that should <em>at best</em> add only one shell, and a shell-holding rack on the side of the gun that's nowhere <em>near</em> the mag tube and should, if anything, only increase your <em>total</em> ammo supply rather than how many shells you can stuff into the gun at once.
<ul><li> Several skills increase the number of rounds held by the magazines of specific weapons, regardless of the magazine's actual physical size. Close By Aced adds 15 shells to shotguns with magazines; Surefire Basic adds 15 rounds to SMGs, LMGs, and Assault Rifles; and Gun Nut basic adds 5 rounds to pistols. The last one can be a little silly, as it also applies to revolvers, allowing them to hold 11 bullets when they clearly have 6 chambers.
</li><li> Other skills allow you to fire your weapons without consuming ammo. Swan Song Aced allows you 9 seconds of continuous fire, while Bulletstorm lets people who use your ammo bags gain up to 5 (Basic) or 15 (Aced) seconds, depending on how much ammo they replenished from the bag.
</li><li> The Ammo Efficiency skill is a downplayed version of this trope; every 3 (Basic) or 2 (Aced) consecutive headshots you get with SMGs, Assault Rifles, or Sniper Rifles fired in single-fire mode will return 1 round to your magazine. If your aim is on point, you can manage to squeeze 11 shots out of a 6 round magazine.

His sword can be "injected with a special fuel" to briefly power it up. This fuel never runs out and never needs to be refilled.

Coatings to put on the arrows are finite, but the arrows themselves never run out. Also, the bowguns have unlimited ammunition of the most basic type. All other types are limited.
</li><li> Compare almost every JRPG. Many many many games with turn-based battle system contain bows, but no arrows, self-returning javelins, infinite kunais, and so on...which never break, either:

</li><li> Nearly every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> game features this in one way or another with primary weapons, whether it be with arrows, bullets, even playing cards. However, some games have a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">Throw</a>" command where a character throws an item (such as ninja stars, a sword, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">money</a>) - it tends to do high damage, but whatever you threw is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever</a>.
<ul><li> As well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> features bows that use limited amounts of arrows (which you tend to get in lots of ten.) That said, the DS remake does away with this: Arrows in this version are only consumed when switching weapons.
</li><li> Ranged weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> have bottomless magazines, but you have to have the right kind of ammo (arrows, crossbow bolts, ammo, and bombs) in order to attack with said weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> originally had arrows as a resource that had to be purchased to use the Archer and Bard's bows, but a later patch removed this for balancing purposes. With the addition of actual firearms with the Machinist class in the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, this got even more ridiculous, in that until a major rebalance with the third expansion, guns explicitly had an ammo limit of three bullets and two separate reloading skills (one to pop in all three bullets at once and one with a quicker cool-down to quickly add one shot) - but not only could you reload as often as you needed to without ever needing to buy more ammo, but in fact the guns continued to function just fine <em>without</em> ammo loaded. The only reason to reload was that the bullets hit harder, let you fire faster, and triggered bonus effects more often when you do. Even the old "Throw" command gets in on the action now, as several tank and melee-focused DPS classes get a skill to toss their weapon (or something else, like Gladiator/Paladin's shield), with the weapon immediately returning to their hands after it hits the target.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> gives you unlimited non-enchanted arrows and crossbow bolts, but limits your magical damage-bonus ammunition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em> had this with archers and hunters who could use an infinite number of arrows so long as they never actually shot them. Using the skill Double Strafe and Arrow Shower however would allow you to shoot a target without actually using an arrow. Players would carry 1 silver or fire arrow for ghost monsters and undead and other types of arrows as needed and a handful of normal arrows for standard shooting. Sadly due to bots exploiting this it was later removed. Some private servers still have the old system.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, quivers hold an utterly ridiculous but finite number of arrows (350 arrows in the same amount of inventory space as a short sword). The Amazon skill Magic Arrow creates arrows out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> and completely removes the need for a quiver. One unique bow, aptly named Endlesshail, has the property that it fires Magic Arrows as its default attack and does not cost any mana.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> plays it straight: quivers are utterly unnecessary for bows and crossbows, and indeed are not even usable except by Demon Hunters, for whom they function more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatSticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatSticks">Stat Sticks</a>.

However, large "siege" vehicles, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Attila LM walker</a> can often regenerate their ammo <em>faster than it can be shot</em>, especially with small weapons like miniguns or AT-Stabbers.

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> the codex explains that ammunition clips consist of a solid block of metal which the gun shaves sand-grain-sized pieces off of. It then uses mass effect fields to accelerate those bits of metal to a small percentage of the speed of light. This gives them effectively unlimited ammunition (each clip makes thousands of bullets), with the limiting factor being overheating rather than ammo capacity.

</li><li> While most weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> use limited magazines, some weapons don't actually swap out their magazines when "reloaded". The Boltor rifle has a lever that recocked which somehow puts more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailEm">nails</a> in the gun, the Ogris rocket launcher has you punch two buttons on the back to load more rockets, etc.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> games, equipping a bow automatically causes a bottomless quiver of arrows to appear on the character's back.

</li><li> The game adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> is kind of wishy-washy with its ammo. Legolas gets 30 arrows, which is reasonable. Aragorn also gets a reasonable 20 arrows. And Gandalf gets 20 ... magic staff blasts. Where it gets silly is with the hobbits and Gimli, whose throwing items are daggers and axes — and they, too, appear to be carrying upwards of 10 or 20 at any given time, far more than would fit anywhere on their character models.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, the aptly-named "Infinity" enchantment for the bow causes it to consume no arrows when fired although, oddly, you still need at least one arrow in inventory to shoot. Apparently it teleports the arrow back to you, or something. You still can't use it endlessly, though—like all tools, an Infinity bow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">wears out and eventually breaks</a> (it can be repaired, but this uses up materials and "enchantment levels"), and special status-effect arrows still get used up.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder28');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder28" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In volume 1 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Die</a></em> manga, Yomiko whirls to face a henchman, only to find that she's out of paper — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">but he's out of bullets, too, and they both take a moment to reload before continuing</a>.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> as we often see Vash reloading with speedloaders (a cylinder's worth of ammunition held ready for loading like a magazine). How he never seems to run out of these is another question, just like the "finite rounds in infinite magazines."
<ul><li> Given that Meryl is able to hide <em>fifty</em> derringers under her cloak, Vash (being a good deal larger than she is) presumably has at least a few dozen speedloaders stashed under his clothes.
</li><li> In the manga we see where he keeps them: they're in those tubes on his coat. Plus we see him buy bullets.
</li><li> The first scene of the anime itself involves Vash nonchalantly surviving an incredible tavern-demolishing volley of gunfire; frequent cuts to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> delivering said volley show that they do stop to reload.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> "Badlands Rumble" has Vash counting the bullets of a group of bounty hunters during the opening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastOut">Blast Out</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Both played straight and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>. Some episodes have characters frequently reloading, while others show characters firing weapons for far longer than they should be able to (even if the weapons used caseless ammunition).
<ul><li> That said, the primary assault rifle of Section 9 (the Seburo C-26A) holds fifty rounds per magazine and their pistol (the Seburo M-5) holds nineteen, so their guns do hold a higher than normal amount of ammunition. The only serious case of this trope is in episode 20, where a DEA agent (or the futuristic Japanese equivalent) fires off far more rounds from his MP5K could possibly hold.
</li></ul></li><li> Subtly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> movie; fighting Spike on a monorail, Vincent unloads a ridiculous amount of bullets from his gun before dramatically reloading. Close inspection will reveal, however, that his pistol is an Infinity made by Strayer-Voight, and the magazine actually holds nineteen rounds in some calibers. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">even closer inspection</a> shows that the casings are marked ".45 ACP", the one caliber the gun in question comes in that <em>doesn't</em> hold that many.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Grenadier">Grenadier</a></em>. A fairly accurate bullet count is kept since the highlight of every episode is when Rushuna Tendo reloads her revolver. Fresh bullets are ejected from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">considerable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">cleavage</a>, then scooped out of the air with the cylinder. In this case it's her cleavage that's bottomless.
<ul><li> Subverted once, when even her cleavage runs out of ammo and it's up to her companions to supply her with bullets.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the final fight scene when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and her rival have their bras cut, and a literal cascade of bullets spill out from each of them.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a> Reload Gunlock</em>, Goku, Gojyo and Hakkai attempt to keep track of how many shots Gato has fired, knowing that two six shooters means twelve shots (and twelve shots means they each get four, and everybody has to take their fair share), and try to attack him while he's reloading. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">The Gunslinger</a> Sanzo sometimes follows the trope and sometimes averts it, but it's worth noting that he never has to <em>buy</em> ammo. Cigarettes, yes; ammo, no.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>'s first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a>, in which the villain's henchmen carry an enormous box of flintlock pistols (which can only fire one shot each) for this reason.
</li><li> Even though they're using magic bullets, no one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> ever uses more bullets in a single battle than their gun can hold without reloading in between. During the longer battles they even keep track of how many spare magazines they have.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> manga, Takeda Kanryu, the opium and weapons dealer, is defeated when his Gatling gun runs out of ammo. In the anime, however, the gun becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns">jammed</a> when Aoshi's underling lodges a thrown projectile on the bullet belt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> averts this with Gargomon, who runs out of ammo twice. The first time, Henry uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload">a recharge card</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The second time, Gargomon is defeated before he can reload.</span>
<ul><li> Happens again with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Megagargomon, but he's so confident that it doesn't matter. To wit: "Who needs ammo when you're a whooping machine?</span>
</li><li> Beelzebumon also runs out of ammo in one of his shotguns (he loses the other one) near the end of his battle against Dukemon.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> franchise tends to avoid this trope a lot, most evident in episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> where Alto very quickly runs out of ammo for the gunpod of the VF-25 he hijacked due to constant sustained fire without relaxing on the trigger.
<ul><li> The one place it will always play this trope completely straight is with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">missiles</a>. Nobody in the history of the series has ever run out of missiles, despite firing them in salvos consisting of dozens at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>, if only to remind the reader that author Keneichi Sonoda is a serious gun otaku.
</li><li> The pilots of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> regularly run out of missiles and gun shells in longer engagements. A few get shot down because of this.
</li><li> Also generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>. Kirika and Mireille are often seen reloading during gunfights with mooks, though sometimes the reloading is presumed to happen off-screen (e.g., Mireille fires off a dozen rounds from her gun's 15-round magazine, the action cuts away to show Kirika fighting, then we cut back to Mireille firing another dozen rounds or so). Where they keep their spare magazines is never shown, though.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. When the scene is serious, Revy needs to reload realistically (no one else lives long enough to get the chance). When it's not, everyone can empty enough rounds to swiss cheese a car without reloading.
</li><li> The title mech of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazinkaiserSKL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazinkaiserSKL">Mazinkaiser SKL</a></em> tends to have an amazing amount of ammo for its chest-mounted pistols, but it <em>does</em> run out. However, its pilot (in that mode, as its a two-seater) is skilled enough to keep attacking and reload at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a></em>: Vincent Valentine's triple barrel "Cerberus" handgun runs out of ammo <em>very</em> quickly during the battle with Bahamut SIN, which gives him a chance to reload on <em>Bahamut's shoulder</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OnlySenseOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OnlySenseOnline">Only Sense Online</a></em>, one of the reasons why the bow is disdained by players of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalVideoGame">titular VRMMORPG</a> is because arrows are one-use consumables and acquiring them from shops is very inefficient.
</li><li> In episode 19 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a>: Brotherhood</em>, we get an inversion of the trope. When Riza is emptying her guns into Lust, the last firearm she pulls is a six-shot revolver, but she only fires off 5 bullets before it starts clicking dry. Even stranger is that earlier in the episode, we got a clear look at the chamber, and she had 6 rounds loaded into it. She ran out of ammo too soon.

When a robber with a handgun threatens the bank Richie and his uncle are in, the uncle says "huh, ten to one it isn't even loaded" and, by offering new bets at higher odds each time, manages to make the robber use up all five shots. Justified because Richie's uncle had recognised the handgun model and knew how many shots it could hold.

<ul><li> Additionally, a few SWAT team members engage the Terminator with their backup pistols. Given that they'd been firing their MP5 submachine guns for a good thirty seconds straight before that, it's implied that they were out of magazines for them.
</li><li> The T-800's M79 is an iffy case, as how many grenades he has in his bandolier varies between scenes, but ultimately he ends up using exactly as many as he has, using his very last one on the T-1000.

Something that has to be seen, preferably widescreen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And at some point she finally does run out of bullets.</span>
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastManStanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastManStanding">Last Man Standing</a></em>. We do see Bruce Willis using up mags and having to reload, and there is a scene which shows him loading numerous spare magazines from boxes of cartridges, but he seems to be able to fit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">an inordinate number of magazines in his pockets</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> avoids this, at least in the first movie's Lobby Scene... to some degree. The protagonists take cover until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> shooting at them begin to reload, then run out and dodge the bullets of other mooks, who are not out of ammo.

Which is, amusingly, one of the cases where having bottomless magazines <em>would</em> make sense, since they are inside virtual reality, Smith is even a part of it, the Matrix was clearly demonstrated to be capable of altering the surroundings on the fly, and the whole point of Agents is that they possess supernatural abilities.

In the Club Fever scene, he actually fires the exact capacity of his pistol with a loaded magazine.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilverStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilverStreak">Silver Streak</a></em>; the protagonist quickly runs out of bullets in a shootout. His sidekick chastises him with "What do you think this is, a Western?"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em>.

</div><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> series in its entirety generally avoids this trope.

<ul><li> Curiously, in most <em>games</em> she has bottomless magazines. And at least one pair of pistols that just don't run out of ammo.

Later, during the final battle against the Reavers, the crew rapidly runs out of ammunition while killing wave after wave of enemies, to the point where Jayne comments that he's down to "three full mags, and my swingin' cod."

Christopher McQuarrie employed his brother, a former Navy SEAL, in an effort to treat firearm usage realistically.

<ul><li> It also shows a very rare example of character changing mags <em>before</em> they went dry just to make sure he won't run out of ammo in the middle of shootout.
</li><li> Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim</span> surrender only because they run out of ammo and they apparently haven't brought spare mags.
</li></ul></li><li> Scrupulously and rigorously averted at the end of Italo-Spanish <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>-bait spy film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerDeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerDeathRay">Danger!!

In fact, the film is so rigorous about this it slows the action down considerably, which is part of why it was MST3K fodder.
</li><li> The final showdown in the serial <em>The Masked Marvel</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and eponymous Masked Marvel shooting at each other while taking cover behind furniture. Ten shots in, the villain leaves cover and announces he's been counting bullets: The Masked Marvel has shot six times (so his gun is empty) but the villain has two shots left. The Masked Marvel similarly leaves cover, agrees with the villain, then <em>shoots him</em>. A lampshaded case of this trope? No, the Masked Marvel simply reloaded during the villain's "now I have won!" speech.
</li><li> Averted once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ultraviolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a></em>.

Otherwise ignored through literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenals</a>.

John McClane seems to spend over half of the first action scene repeatedly slamming new magazines into his automatic, to the point where you start wondering where he got all those from (of course, McClane bringing five to ten extra mags to a run-of-the-mill arrest, just in case, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">actually kind of in-character</a>).
<ul><li> Even John falls victim to this aversion in the first movie. He only fires 16-17 shots before he first reloads his Beretta. This means that he at most fires one more bullet than the gun can carry. He also probably takes his reloads from his enemies' corpses, and the amount of ammo he has left becomes an important plot point.

<div class="indent"><strong>Gyro Captain:</strong> Empty! All this time...! That's dishonest.
</div></li><li> Averted thoroughly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu">Zulu</a> Dawn</em>, in which the British at Isandlwana have the Zulus pinned down with hideously effective gunfire and are holding their position well, but suddenly find themselves scrabbling for their last few rounds. Meanwhile, the quartermasters are handing it out to the drummer boys a packet (20 shots) at a time, as if they were at peacetime manoeuvres, to take to troops several hundred yards away. Historically accurate. The few survivors who got to Rorke's Drift before the fighting reached there tipped the troops at the Drift off as to what had happened, and all the ammo boxes were opened at once before the battle started. Things then went very differently. And by the end of that one, their 20,000 rounds were down to about 900.
</li><li> Averted by, of all things, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentNightDeadlyNightPart2">Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2</a></em>.

Bond disarms the assassin and the two converse, but Bond "carelessly" allows the assassin to retrieve his dropped pistol — which clicks on an empty chamber. Bond doesn't even flinch and says "That's a Smith and Wesson, and you've had your six." before killing the assassin.
<ul><li> Unfortunately the gun in question is a Colt automatic. The line is an artifact, taken verbatim from the book - and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">very awesome.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, during the final battle the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> clearly has to reload his pistol after eight or nine shots. Played straight earlier in the movie with Bond and the assault rifle, though they attempted to mask this by having him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">toss away his guns and grab new ones from bad guys</a> rather than actually reload.

While the scarcity of ammunition is used to explain why raiders attack the main character, it seems to be a complete non-issue when the main character fires twenty some rounds with perfect accuracy from a ten-shot pistol. One scene involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shooting with automatic weapons until a house literally falls apart,</span> though some guns are reloaded from cover in the same scene.
</li><li> In an early scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleIII">Mission: Impossible III</a></em>, Ethan Hunt invokes one trope, averts it a few seconds later, and then averts this one.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> carefully avoids this. Hicks instructs the Marines to use "short, controlled bursts" to avoid wasting ammo. Vasquez is eventually reduced to a sidearm when her rifle runs dry, and Ripley's ammo counter is constantly shown during the finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> averts it, if you pay close attention. Hawkeye runs out of arrows during the final fight (though he does seem to have an inordinately large stock of them), and he is forced to tear one out of a killed Chitauri in order to use his grappling-hook arrow head. Notably, by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, he's upgraded to an expanded quiver, presumably to counter this problem.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em>. Iron Man's power source, the arc reactor, will run out of power if the power drain from the suit outstrips the power output of the reactor for too long.

The spy who kills Erskine runs out of ammunition after firing sixteen bullets from a gun with an eight round magazine. One could argue that he had two magazines, but if so, given what he was doing while firing shots eight and nine, he was able to rapidly reload a gun while driving a car without losing control of the vehicle.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>. Guns run out of bullets and need to be reloaded or replaced throughout the movie, especially in the church scene.

One goon tries to catch him, but didn't check his ammo and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets">fired on an empty chamber</a>.

Oddly enough, the pistols he uses are underloaded, carrying six rounds each in a Desert Eagle that holds seven.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JohnWick">John Wick</a></em> series, the filmmakers are so dedicated to averting the trope that action scenes are scripted and storyboarded with John's ammo count in mind, making sure he never fires more than what he's carrying, and forcing him to reload or grab another gun once he should be empty. They also make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmunitionConservation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmmunitionConservation">Ammunition Conservation</a> a character trait; John, whenever possible, takes precise single shots (especially since he favors headshots over center mass, a smaller, difficult target), and only sprays blind fire as a last resort (as in the start of the catacombs firefight in <em>Chapter 2</em>, when he does not have cover and must flee from a wave of incoming shooters). Specific examples include:
<ul><li> John frequently has to reload his guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick">John Wick</a></em>, and the number of bullets he shoots before he has to reload in usually accurate to the gun model in question. In one scene, he punches a mook in the neck with his gun, tries to deliver a headshot, grimaces, reloads, and shoots him in the space of three seconds.
</li><li> Becomes a plot point in the climactic battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWickChapter2">John Wick: Chapter 2</a></em>, where John is given a .45 with precisely seven rounds. He fires all seven rounds in the first few seconds of the gunfight and is forced to scavenge weapons from downed enemies. Earlier in the film, he's shown repeatedly reloading when he has the opportunity, and he never fires more rounds than the weapon he has could hold.
<ul><li> In an earlier fight John uses up all the rounds in a shotgun and is required to reload, while pinning a mook to the wall with the business end of the weapon, when he finishes reloading the results are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">spectacular</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRaid">The Raid</a></em>. Lt. Wahyu acquires a S&amp;W 327 from a thug near the end of the movie. Over the rest of the film he fires six shots, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tries to commit suicide with it. The gun fails to fire with a big CLICK.</span> That particular revolver is notable for having an eight shot cylinder, instead of the usual six.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heat">Heat</a></em>, the characters are shown frequently reloading in the background of scenes.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando">Commando</a></em> suffers from this trope in some scenes, as mentioned above, the fight between Duke and Matrix nicely averts this with Duke firing six shots from his revolver before getting the drop on Matrix and pulling the trigger only to have a loud *click* result. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> of two special forces veterans both failing to track the number of rounds he fired is not however addressed.

<ul><li> Whereas normal fairy weapons use nuclear batteries that essentially have unlimited ammo, Holly even comments on it when the goblin shooting at her runs out of shots.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> series. In the first few novels, Roland worries about how much ammo he has left, until he makes a pit stop and buys a few hundred bullets. Also, during every firefight, Roland and his friends must reload.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisLAmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisLAmour">Louis L'Amour</a> usually averted this in his Western novels, even pointing out that even in a loaded pistol, the chamber under the hammer was left empty to prevent accidents, meaning one less bullet than modern audiences might expect.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7l9qg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7l9qg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7l9qg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The issue with the revolvers in Lamour's novels is that when the hammer is down, it rests directly on the percussion cap (in early revolvers) or the primer (in cartridge-fed arms) and a sharp knock to the hammer can set it off. Not an issue in the heat of battle, since once you fired a shot, the hammer was "down" on a fired chamber anyway and thereby safe until you thumbed the hammer back (as you had to with many of these guns) to cock it and spin the cylinder for the next round. Modern double-action revolvers have a modified and much safer trigger mechanism, which removes the need for this practice, though exponents of Wild West reenactment shoots still need to bear it in mind as their revolvers are faithful copies of the originals (with all that this implies).</span>

Beam Piper's <em>Uller Uprising</em>, when the male protagonist is impressed by his new, previously civilian adjutant taking their supply of ammunition into account (see page quote). They can't produce ammunition as fast as they've been expending it, and need to end the war before they run out.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>, in the barricade sequence; several plot points hinge on the need to conserve powder and bullets, not least <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of Gavroche, who's shot while out in front of the barricade scavenging ammo from fallen guardsmen</span>.
</li><li> Averted once in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars</a></em> novel <em>Tyrant's Test</em>: Chewbacca and his son are on a mission to rescue Han, and in the final battle they switch out their blasters for bowcasters, partly because the enemy has blast shields, but also partly because they're almost out of power for the blasters.
</li><li> An allegedly bottomless magazine is the key clue in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a> mystery. A (crooked) lawman claimed that he received two minor gunshot wounds before taking the gun away from the man who shot him and then killed the gun's owner and his four cohorts with one bullet each. The town hailed the sheriff as a hero until somebody pointed out that you can't shoot seven bullets from a six-shooter without reloading at some point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfSamuraiCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfSamuraiCat">The Adventures of Samurai Cat</a></em>, Tomokato's older brother Shimura demonstrated in the second book that the "Badass" part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> still applied: he carried an utterly ridiculous number of Colt .45 semi-automatic pistols <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">in his kimono</a>, and his wife had an even more ludicrous amount of extra ammunition. But they <em>still</em> ran dry during the big shoot-out of that story.
</li><li> Carefully averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>: Katniss is limited to a total of twelve arrows, and retrieves used arrows whenever she can. Several times throughout the story, the reader is informed about exactly how many arrows she still has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarZ">World War Z</a></em> - In the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Yonkers, the US military engages the horde of 8 million zombies shuffling north of of Manhattan with anti-tank weapons, against what was obviously a human wave attack. Veteran (more accurately "survivor") of Yonkers Todd Waino explains that even if they thought the armor-piercing depleted-uranium rounds the tanks fired were useful against a massed zombie horde (which they are not)...all of the heavy artillery ran out of ammunition after under an hour of sustained fire. Waino says that it simply <em>never occurred</em> to the officers commanding the battle to count how many rounds they had. Something as basic as "this tank can carry 40 rounds, and fire once a minute; wow, they'll need a reload in 40 minutes". Maybe they thought a single shot would take out hundreds of zombies each time...but against a horde literally numbering in the millions?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieSurvivalGuide">The Zombie Survival Guide</a></em> also averts this trope in several ways. It notes that power tools can be effective against the undead...until the batteries run out and they provide as much protection as a hand-held stereo. Also, using battery-powered sights on guns should be avoided, as they'd just be blank tubes once the batteries run out. Finally, there's Maxim #4: "Blades don't need reloading."
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reamde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reamde">Reamde</a></em>, which contains an almost fetishistic level of detail on firearm handling. Stephenson even credits someone as his firearm copyeditor.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett">Dan Abnett</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a> novel <em>The Guns of Tanith</em>, it's a crucial point, because they were supplied with the wrong sort of power pack and must jump practically unarmed.
</li><li> An energy-weapon aversion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Galactic Patrol</a>; Kimball Kinnison drains the power packs of several blasters while waiting for his suit batteries to recharge.
</li><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMay">Karl May</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou">Winnetou</a></em> novels and related work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> Old Shatterhand's "Henry carbine" (not to be confused with the real life Henry <em>rifle</em>) actually packs "only" twenty-five shots into a magazine that's apparently complex enough that few if any enemies who manage to get hold of the gun ever figure it out, but because that's still a lot of shots between reloads and he rarely needs to expend them all before topping it off again a number of his more superstitious adversaries — especially those who only know him by reputation — do end up convinced that the weapon is somehow magical and a straight example of the trope, and he in turn takes full advantage of that misconception quite a few times.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Jack Ryan</a> novel <em>The Bear and the Dragon</em>, during the inevitable war sequence, a hardened target comes up to be hit. The initial idea is to use ground-penetrating bombs (aka Bunker Busters), until someone points out that <em>getting</em> the bombs that have already been used in the campaign required several days of direct, non-stop flights, and that the bombs might not even be available. True to form, the arsenal has been depleted, and while the manufacturer is making more, they won't be available for weeks.
</li><li> Consistently averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ASimpleSurvey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ASimpleSurvey">A Simple Survey</a></em>. When firearms show up, they almost always have a specific amount of ammunition, and its scarcity is a plot point. The most extreme example of this is a story in which each character has a handgun with exactly one bullet.
</li><li> Purposely averted in all adaptations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision">Intellivision</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightStalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightStalker">Night Stalker</a></em>. In the Intellivision version you get six shots for each gun. In the Atari 2600 version <em>Dark Cavern</em> each gun gives you up to 10 shots, which you can accumulate throughout the game, up to 99 shots.
</li><li> Averted during some of the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> books. In addition to all the other destruction it caused, the Oyster Bay strike destroyed Manticore's missile production lines. For the next several books, Manitcore's strategic and tactical decisions are constantly being influenced by the need to conserve their limited missile supplies.

However, given the presence of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a> hypertech, there are exceptions, though they are usually explicit ones. The most notable of these are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Aegis reloaders</a>, which use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace">Hammerspace</a> to reload the REACT team's heavy weapons. There are only a few of them, however, and they are carefully monitored because the bullets fed through them completely disintegrate after a few minutes, making them a potential nightmare for law enforcement. They also tend to jam during extended firing in a way which destroys the mechanism.

Lampshading how unlikely it is to run out of shots with a 500 round battery, and then getting understandably irate when the pulse pistol he loots from an enemy ALSO runs out of energy after only a handful of shots.

</li><li> When Max and 99 are in a department store, Max suggests that he shoot out the lights for cover. He fires six shots, but there's still one light. He tries to shoot that one, but he's out of ammo. 99 then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">turns off the light switch</a>. For the rest of the episode Max tries to bluff KAOS agents with his empty gun.
</li><li> When Max and his boss are in a gunfight with a KAOS agent, Max suddenly stands up and says that he's going on strike until his boss approves a better contract for him. His boss then sighs and signs the contract while Max and the KAOS agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">discuss what sorts of benefits</a> KAOS offers. When he signs the contract, the KAOS agent pulls the trigger on his gun, but nothing happens. Max then captures him and calmly says that he heard him fire six shots. When his boss says that he only heard five shots, Max takes the gun and tries to fire again - when it goes off and Max sheepishly says "Six."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jake20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jake20">Jake 2.0</a></em>: Averted, where the protagonist caught in a predator/prey situation is able to beat an armed villain. After deliberately coming out of hiding, the man raises his gun to shoot Jake, only to realize that he's out, told that he should keep track, and is promptly knocked out with a lead pipe.

<ul><li> Averted, wherein the people of the town are very conscious of their ammunition, and the heroes are continually requesting new magazines and fighting over the actual weapons themselves.
</li><li> Used by Hawkins and Jake during a gunfight when they count the number of shots a bad guy spends before making their move.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution">Revolution</a></em>: Averted, since a major factor in the story is that ammunition for modern weapons is in very short supply. In fact, Monroe was discussing the issue with Miles in a flashback in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RevolutionS1E10NobodysFaultButMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RevolutionS1E10NobodysFaultButMine">episode 10</a>. If characters gets hold of a loaded gun, it will usually only have a few bullets in it and they quickly have to go back to using bows and swords. In some instances the trope even gets inverted when weapons that should have a full magazine, run dry after 2-3 shots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRockfordFiles">The Rockford Files</a></em>: Generally averted. It is frequently important to the plot that Jim's gun fires only six shots, and he never has any extra ammunition.

<ul><li> The SG team members actually have to reload their guns now and again, and not just for the sake of dramatically running low. One episode that still stands out has a rogue NID agent escaping from a special forces team, using a machine pistol to lay down suppressive fire and shoot a lock out of a door. At least twice, after a couple of sustained bursts, he ejects his magazine and slaps a fresh one in.
</li><li> In another episode, they give the villagers guns and join them to try and repel Ori footsoldiers, but are overrun when they run out of ammo... And judging by the befuddled looks of the villagers, they didn't have time to warn them beforehand.
</li><li> In the early episode "Emancipation", O'Neill trades his sidearm to a warlord in exchange for Carter. The warlord proceeds to show off to his companions by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringInTheAirALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringInTheAirALot">Firing in the Air a Lot</a> and O'Neill quietly mutters they should get moving before he finishes the magazine and realizes he was duped.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has a few exceptions: combi-weapons are boltguns with a one-shot special weapon attachment, the Manticore missile launcher gets four missiles and then is done, the Black Templars get the Holy Orb of Antioch (a one-shot super-grenade), and a few other one-shot powers.
<ul><li> The spinoff game Aeronautica Imperialis has limited ammunition for every weapon. Yes, even rayguns.
<ul><li> Curiously, almost all ground defenses are unlimited ammunition.
</li></ul></li><li> The community ruleset for 40k using the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay rules has not only limited ammunition but a 10% chance of jamming every time you fire a full-auto weapon.
</li><li> The Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy rules state that they assume all models have sufficient shots to last the entire battle (given the average game length, that translates to around six or eight bullets/laser bolts/bursts of small metal shuriken/arrows/powder charges/crossbow bolts/javelins/etc. per person, which is perfectly reasonable). However, certain scenario rules do limit the number of shots units can take in a turn (mostly justified by limited supplies).
<ul><li> It's also entirely reasonable that each trooper carries enough ammunition for the battle, as (due to the turn-based movement) each hour translates to roughly 15 minutes in-universe. In addition, a lot of the ammunition has either been handwaved due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> (such as Tyranids biologically producing the ammunition from within their bodies to guns that literally recharge their batteries in heat or sunlight). In addition, given the average length of a game (which is 6 turns) it's understandable that a standard pistol might never even need to be reloaded, much less need additional ammunition (in 6 turns, a pistol will fire only 6 shots, and that's if it's fired every single turn and the bearer isnt killed), to say nothing of larger, automatic guns (which fire a maximum of 12 shots in those 6 turns).
</li><li> On the whole, the 40k and Fantasy universes tend to avert the trope - some by the simple expedient of "The model has enough shots to last the battle", but in the specialist games this is looked into in more details. The fantasy spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mordheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mordheim">Mordheim</a></em> has certain weapons (such as barbed arrows and vials of holy water) that had limited ammunition, but the 40k narrative game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor">Inquisitor</a></em> took it to ridiculous levels with noting down the number of shots, the time taken to reload, the number of magazines a person has and even what order the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">special bullet types</a> were preloaded in. As a general rule, the less models to keep track of, the more detailed the mechanics.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain rules advert this. The Dire Avengers can use a special attack called "Bladestorm" where each member of the squad gets an additional shot to their standard gun, but doing so expends the remainder of the ammunition in the gun, forcing them to reload next turn (and thus cannot fire, but curiously can still fight in close combat). Heavy Weapons also have this limitation, being unable to move and fire in the same turn unless the wielder has Relentless, rationalizing that the bearer has to load up the gun(in the case of Missile launchers) or charge it up and brace himself for the attack. Likewise, Ordinance weapons and Barrage Artillery Weapons must remain stationary to fire even on a tank, as the crew needs to manually load each shell into the firing chamber.
</li><li> One Apocalypse formation, the Tyranid Endless Swarm, has an entertaining special rule: if any one unit rolls five or more 6's to hit while shooting at them, their weapons all jam and the Tyranids take no damage.
</li><li> Discussed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> novel <em>Know No Fear</em>, while some Ultramarines are talking about Orks. One of them points out how important round count is, since while it's not too hard to kill an Ork with massive damage, this needs to be balanced against how many friends he brought along (which is usually quite a large number).
</li><li> The massive gatling gun mounted on the Stompa can fire out a ludicrous amount of bullets in a single turn, but there's a chance that the loaders would get a bit too zealous and load ALL of the ammunition into it. This is represented by the weapon firing a (ridiculously huge) random amount of shots determined by dice, and if a certain result comes up it means the gun has run out of ammo.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> gives limited ammunition for all weapons (yes, even the laser guns). Some have absurdly large magazines (the Fichetti Security pistol is a light handgun with a 30-bullet magazine), but they are all limited. Most even make sense.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20">Star Wars d20</a></em> game gives limited ammo for most blasters, which makes sense as they are actually shooting plasma (ionized gas), not laser bolts. However, blaster pistols don't need a new power pack until you have fired <em>a hundred shots</em> (blaster rifles are slightly more reasonable at 50).
</li><li> Laser barrels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> are rated for six shots (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the usual 5% chance of exploding</a> during any given shot). You <em>can</em> go over the limit, but the chance of explosion keeps going up. Some gamemasters keep careful count of shots fired; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">others</a> just pick someone who hasn't reloaded in a while, roll some dice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">ignore the result</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">declare that their weapon explodes</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Now please report for termination, Citizen. Have a pleasant day. The Computer is your friend.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> mostly averts this. Non-energy weapons draw upon a finite supply of ammunition stored in the carrying unit and individual shots or salvos are tracked not just to determine when they run out, but also to compute the damage caused by an exploding ammo bin on an appropriate critical hit — shots already expended obviously can't blow up anymore. Some weapons still do pack fairly silly numbers of shots into a single ammo slot, though (machine guns being particularly bad offenders), and ammo expenditure for most infantry-level weapons is indeed not tracked on the boardgame level (which, to be fair, is more concerned with the interaction between larger units with bigger guns).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infinity">Infinity</a></em>, most weapons are assumed to be unlimited, but certain weapons have limits - the Panzerfaust, for example, is basically a two-shot mini-rocket launcher.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PsionicsTheNextStageInHumanEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PsionicsTheNextStageInHumanEvolution">Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution</a></em>. Every gun has an ammo capacity and firing on fully automatic (if possible) will empty your clip in one round.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder35');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder35" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em>Usually</em> the case in the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Game</a> <em>Charley Chuck's Food Fight</em>, whose objective is to fight your way past four mean chefs to get to an ice cream cone by throwing food from large piles of it. In most cases, this depletes the pile quickly. The one exception are the watermelons, which have an unlimited supply.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em> was one of the first FPS games to avert this. The semi-auto pistol went through a reloading animation (with Duke ejecting the spent magazine and replacing it with a fresh one) every twelve shots. However, this being an old game for MS-DOS-era PCs when having a 144 MHz Pentium MMX and 32 MB RAM counted as state-of-the-art, the game engine didn't actually keep track of the shots present in your magazine; instead, the game engine blocked the firing hotkey and played the reload animation whenever the ammo counter hit a multiple of 12. This had the side effect of making it impossible to change magazine other than by depleting your current one. The modern DukePlus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> keeps a separate ammo counter for it, however, and Duke can reload whenever he wants. The same goes for the MP5 replacement for the Ripper, and in both, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a> is in full effect.
<ul><li> Other games on the Build engine frequently did the same thing, and also frequently used systems as simple as <em>Duke 3D</em> did; those which didn't just trigger the reload on a certain multiple of ammo left (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior1997">Shadow Warrior</a></em>'s Uzi(s), which reloaded whenever you hit a multiple of 50 bullets on its own or 100 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a>) had very small amounts of ammo to track, and would "forget" how much you'd expended and reset you to the full mag upon switching out (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawedOffShotgun">Sawed-Off Shotgun</a>, which reloaded after every two shells). The only game on the engine to make extensive use of reloading was <em>World War II GI</em>, and even that only means that the same rules as <em>Duke 3D</em>'s pistol or <em>Shadow Warrior</em>'s Uzis applied to about four or five weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Goldeneye007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Goldeneye007">Goldeneye 007</a></em> was also one of the earliest games to use realistically-sized magazines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> built upon <em>Goldeneye 007</em> by being among the first games to implement reloading animations — in <em>Goldeneye</em> the reload animation was just Bond lowering his gun for about two seconds, whereas in <em>Medal of Honor</em> the MP40 and the Tommygun actually had Patton replace the magazine and cock the bolt.
</li><li> Ammunition is a precious commodity in the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> games, most notably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Resident Evil  Code: Veronica</a></em> where there is simply not enough ammo to kill everything - fortunately, it's also the first game in the series where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">the knife</a> is truly useful.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>, along with the 4th and 5th games in the series, have infinite ammo as an unlockable, but it still requires you to reload when the mag is empty. It makes a lot of sense from a gameplay perspective to have reloads needed for infinite ammo, especially since it's a skill and players can match skills to help their playstyle, but also to stop players from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">making a powerhouse out of an automatic rifle.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a></em> and its sequel. This is actually very strange, as the source material commonly portrays most of the weapons as having unlimited ammunition, or at least very large magazines. For example, the Stormtrooper blaster rifle canonically has 100 shots per power pack and hold enough blaster gas for 500 shots before they need a refill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> have limited ammunition for bows, crossbows, and slings, but the ammunition limit is absurdly high, with the only practical limitation on how many shots you can take being the weight of the ammunition, and 99 arrows only weigh about a pound in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> world. Spellcasters, however, have significantly limited ammunition on attack spells.
</li><li> Averted totally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying">Clive Barker's Undying</a></em> with the pistol and other real-world weapons, including shotguns and dynamite. Further subverted with the Tibetan War Cannon, which has infinite power, but must be recharged.
</li><li> Partially averted in <em>Deep Space Nine: The Fallen</em> with the smallest pistol, which has infinite power, but must be recharged.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone">Blake Stone</a> 3D</em> also has a weapon like this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> gives ammo limits to the heavy weapons — most notably the main guns on artillery, AA guns, tanks, ships and mechanised infantry. Of course, towns and APCs have a seemingly bottomless supply of ammo to provide them.
<ul><li> In addition, the secondary weapons (typically machine guns) never run out of ammo.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BushidoBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BushidoBlade">Bushido Blade</a></em>; during your fight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">Giant Space Flea from Nowhere</a> Katze, he has a pistol and you have a sword. However, he only has six shots before he has to stop and reload. While he reloads, he's absolutely helpless and can be easily killed.
<ul><li> This was repeated in the sequel, although one of your opponents carries a freaking machine gun and both of them are practically impossible to kill while reloading now.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</a></em>, not only you have to reload your guns as in real life, but you also have to memorize how much ammo you have left in your magazine, since there is no visible counter! And there's no crosshair, so you'll have to manually aim using the normal iron sight on the gun. Which is not necessarily an easy task, one might add, as broken bones are not only possible but probable.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CloseCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CloseCombat">Close Combat</a></em> series of strategy games (not the first person shooter <em>First to Fight</em>) you command platoon- or company-size units of infantry and tanks which start each mission with an allotment of ammo and NO re-supply. If you shoot your machine gun dry trying to suppress the enemy positions, that's it. If your tank expends all its shells trying to blast the enemy out of buildings, that's it. Mortars, tanks, and machine guns have particularly serious problems with this. Running the enemy out of ammo is actually a valid tactic in some situations.
</li><li> Carefully inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4">SWAT 4</a></em> where reloading is done realistically: you have a limited number of magazines, with real-life number of bullets. And each of your magazines keep the rest of their bullets if you reload prematurely, so you can just go back to a half-depleted magazine later on.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series, missile soldiers and siege weapons have limited ammo that can only be refilled between battles.
<ul><li> Played straight with the artillery in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NapoleonTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NapoleonTotalWar">Napoleon</a></em>, as warfare in the featured time periods was heavily influenced by cannons. Musket- and rifle-armed infantry do have limited ammo, although you're not likely to run out in most battles, especially since you'll be often sending in the same infantry on bayonet charges after a few volleys. In <em>Empire</em>, until you develop ring bayonets, your soldiers will not be able to shoot for the rest of the battle if you have them plug up the barrels with blades and charge.
</li></ul></li><li> Partial Exception: In the original <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conflict">Conflict</a></em> for the NES and its sequel <em>Super Conflict</em> for the SNES, any units with "special weapons" had to re-supply those at a city (or airport for flying units). The standard weapons, which were all variations of machine guns, never needed to be reloaded.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> games, waaaay back in 1995/96, you had to manage magazines for the various projectile-based weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> avoids this. You and your enemies have to reload, and a limited amount of magazines, when they've spent all their ammo they'll usually start hitting you with melee weapons instead — and though bots appear to have bottomless magazines, they will run out of ammo if you wait long enough (usually long enough to kill you several times over). When the bots run out of ammo they'll say "Low Ammo" and attempt to run away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earth2150" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earth2150">Earth 2150</a></em> has limited ammo for all weapons. Energy weapons recharge over time, but units using grenades, bullets or rockets need to be resupplied by plane. Guard your supply center well.
<ul><li> Ballistic weapons in <em>Earth 2150</em> carry limited amounts of ammo and must be re-supplied from a supply depot. Fortunately, there are air units that will bring the ammo to units in the field.
</li><li> Every non-energy/chemical vehicle-mounted weapon in the sequel, <em>Earth 2160</em>, also have limited ammo. Fortunately, it's easier to supply that ammo. For the ED, an ammo supply can be built, which will automatically take care of supplying ammo via a projectile. For the UCS, it's a lot more annoying as ammo can only be supplied using an air unit that's highly susceptable to anti-air weapons and because ammo-limited vehicles are the staple units in their army.
</li><li> The computer, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">plays it straight</a>. Due to relatively low damage output and lots of hit points of most units sometimes even truly incredible superiority in numbers for a single battle is nothing if you don't have supplies.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>, all weapons have limited capacities and can only be fired a limited number of times (using action points) before you need to manually reload them (which also costs action points). If an NPC runs out of ammunition, he usually switches to a melee weapon and closes the distance, though it happened very rarely due to most NPC carrying enough rounds for a few full reloads and most fights being over before that point (unless you stole their spare ammo [meaning they would be left with only a full mag] or picked a trait turning you into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Area</a> [thereby potentially making them lose ammunition through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">Critical Failure</a>]). An idling animation for pistols, on the other hand, has the character empty a magazine from the gun and load another one without that actually affecting the number of bullets in the gun at the moment.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaster">The Master</a> — never had to reload the gatling guns connected to his chair. The boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> — Frank Horrigan — has to reload his weapon and did run out of ammunition eventually, whereupon he whipped out a really long knife.
</li><li> Additionally the spare ammo for a gun takes up room in your inventory. For pistols and rifles this is negligible but for heavier weapons (such as machine guns and rocket launchers) carrying enough ammo for a prolonged engagement can put a crimp in the amount of space in your inventory for loot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, while you do have to reload regularly depending on weapon, your ammo weighs nothing, which means you can carry absurd amounts of ammunition around the world with you, especially if you trade excessively with the outcasts who trade ammunition for other equipment. Amusingly enough, <em>nuclear warheads</em> count as ammunition for game purposes.
<ul><li> An interesting variation occurs with the Gauss Rifle from the "Operation Anchorage" expansion. Each shot requires a new microfusion cell (a type of ammo for energy weapons), but the actual projectiles are pre-loaded into the weapon and never run out (unless that's what the weapon's Durability measures, rather than physical wear as with other weapons).
</li></ul></li><li> This is also played with for the enemies of the game. They reload like the player but have literally infinite ammo. They can even spawn ammo for a weapon they pick up off their slain comrades.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, companion characters are coded to use "Magical Companion Ammo" for their default gun so that they never run out of ammo, though any other weapon you give them uses regular ammo. Also, activating Hardcore mode also gives ammo weight, meaning that you cannot carry a limitless stack of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> features a "Never Ending" modifier for Legendary weapons that plays like the classic use of this, where your weapon still requires ammo, but as long as you have any on your person you can fire it all at once without ever having to swap for a fresh magazine. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/GameBreaker/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/GameBreaker/Fallout">Never Ending Laser Musket</a>, on the other hand, behaves entirely different by being able to load as many Fusion Cells as you want and firing it all in one shot, more than enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">drop down a Deathclaw in one hit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland">Wasteland</a></em>, not only is your own ammunition limited, the faster you kill gun-toting enemies, the more bullets they're likely to have left. They also have to reload if they run out and want to fire again.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>. Several characters can use bows, but they're entirely worthless without also providing a steady supply of arrows. However the DS remake will not do this, as they wish to balance the characters and removed this restriction.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series of games, all weapons have limited ammo, after which they break. Archers, swordsmen, axemen, spearmen and spellcasters all run out of ammo. The only ones who don't attack with their teeth/claws, which would be troublesome if they broke, to say the least.
<ul><li> The weapon's "ammo" actually represents its durability. After using it all up, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">weapon breaks</a>. One has to wonder, however, why archers never need to carry arrows, they just pull infinite amounts out of the quivers. And why does a spell book, which only has a single spell written in it, break after casting that spell 40 times?
<ul><li> We can assume that each bow comes with a quiver of a certain size. And if the magic is nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian</a> or similar to certain RPGs, then the need to (very quickly) memorize the spell again can consume a copy from the book.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a></em> averts this in the console-exclusive Prototype Mode. Firing a shot uses one bullet, and firing your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingLasers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingLasers">Homing Lasers</a> uses 120. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">If you run out of bullets you'll be downgraded to a short-range attack.</a> Bullets can be replenished by absorbing enemy bullets, and you can store up to 999 bullets.
</li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone">Killzone</a></em>: Whenever the player reloads with the squad leader's default assault rifle, he always flips over two magazines taped to each other — the second time, he discards these magazines and bring up a new taped pair of magazines.
<ul><li> Now becoming common for AK-47s and other weapons using box magazines. Many games play the trope straight by having the character simply flip over the magazine pair, with no indication that the other magazine is refilled or replaced. Based on accounts of real-life bearers who rig the magazines together for efficiency, but eventually have to dispose of both when empty.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaTheCityOfLostHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaTheCityOfLostHeaven">Mafia</a></em>. Reloading with the mag half full? Say goodbye to those rounds, they're gone for good.
<ul><li> Enemies also have fairly limited ammo (a handful of magazines at most), and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">charge you to try and punch you with their fists when they run out</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>. You can only carry magazines, not individual ammo. If you want to reload manually... you can't. The only way is to waste the rest of the magazine and wait for a new one to be loaded. Note that some weapons do have almost-instantaneous reload speeds (the fusion pistol), one has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxReload">Unorthodox Reload</a> (even the manual teases the player on how the shotguns are supposed to reload themselves by flipping them over T2-style), and one just doesn't have ammo and has to be replaced when running out, usually at the worst time possible (the alien rifle). The enemies, however, have no such limits.
<ul><li> Especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> with the Troopers on higher difficulties, who have a tendency to spam endless streams of grenades from the gun that the game explicitly states is much like your assault rifle, which can only hold 8 at a time. Oddly enough, they seem reluctant to use the assault rifle part of the assault rifle.
<ul><li> Because the assault rifle part is inaccurate as hell. They only use it when they're sure they will hit, which is at hug distance.
</li></ul></li><li> Only carrying mags is referenced in game at one point. You are advised to "clear that clip" so you'll have a full one loaded when you head into the next wave of aliens.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> has Vulcan Raven lugging around a huge minigun... and an ammo drum that's almost as big as he is. And the guy's <em>giant</em>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the fight with Revolver Ocelot is very specific about giving him six shots, after which he has to reload.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> averts this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">in a cutscene</a>. When Ocelot first uses a revolver against Snake in a gun battle, it eventually ends with the two in a standoff. Snake then lowers his gun and comments, grinning, "You don't have what it takes to kill me." Ocelot pulls the trigger several times, only to find that his revolver has run out of ammo - it holds two fewer shots than the semi-auto pistol he'd been using in their first confrontation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is possible that this was intentional, however, as Ocelot turns out to have actually been Snake's CIA support, ADAM.</span>
<ul><li> In the boss fight later, he uses a second revolver to get around this. The game also goes out of the way to show you how much ammo <em>he</em> has remaining, and shooting him while he's reloading is an important tactic.
<ul><li> In a later cutscene Ocelot is shown to be carrying <em>three</em> revolvers, apparently for juggling, and towards the end of the game he uses an attachable stock to brace a revolver against his shoulder for a long shot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">The man really loves revolvers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Enemies have to swap magazines after a certain number of shots when in combat, even if they have an infinite number of mags in reserve. However, if you blow up a nearby ammo dump with high explosives, they will be left with a single magazine for their rifle and their backup pistol, leaving them to engage you with a knife if you set off an alert.
<ul><li> The game then goes and screws this all up by letting the player unlock a gun with a drum magazine with the feeding ramp shaped like an infinity symbol, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum">which Snake amusingly acknowledges would give him infinite ammo</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Ace Online</a></em> hilariously averts the biggest argument (who would want to pull the plane over to reload) almost because it can: You <em>do</em> have to pull your fighter plane over and top up on bullets and missiles. And you can carry over <em>1400</em> of some types of missiles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni">Oni</a></em>, which is very strict about ammunition limits. Though issue of different types of ammunition is solved (by having generic "ballistic cells" and "energy cells" for ballistic and energy weapons), ammunition is not only limited by the number of ammo cells available, but also by differentiating the number of shots each gun gets from a cell (a ballistic cell means 10 shots for a standard pistol, but two for the sniper rifle). This tends to make the game's hand-to-hand fighting the most reliable form of combat.
<ul><li> And yes, the enemy has limited ammo. If you want to be able to scavenge it off of them, you have to attack them before they shoot it all at you.
</li></ul></li><li> Lucasarts' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlaws">Outlaws</a></em>. Each gun had to be reloaded, <em>one painful bullet at a time</em>.
<ul><li> Same in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu">Déjà Vu</a></em> games. Guns were opened as any container to insert rounds. It's not a gunplay-heavy game, though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em>, you have limited ammo, but you never reload.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> games, both you and the bad guys could run out of ammo. However, given the one-shot death nature of the game, this was unlikely to happen normally unless you made prodigious use of suppressive fire.
<ul><li> Subverted and averted in the <em>Vegas</em> subseries. You only get unlimited ammo for your sidearm. You do have to reload, but you'll never run out spare ammunition for it. Averted in the fact that you can see and hear your teammates and enemies reload<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note871rg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note871rg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note871rg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although enemies seem to only need to reload shotguns and sniper rifles, since those can still kill you in one hit, and your allies only ever reload if you tell them to stack up on a door and they haven't done so in a while</span>, and mounted machine guns, like your sidearm, must reload but do not have a total ammo limit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> is very conscious about ammo. In fact, the Alt Eisen's Revolver Stake, which is shown to be shot six times every time it is used, is reloaded by a reloader afterwards. This actually explains the fact that it shoots so many times, and yet the attack can only be used six times.
<ul><li> There are equipment, accessories, and abilities that allow ammunition-based weaponry to be used more. Kyosuke's Revolver Stake can be upped from six shots on a mission to nine or twelve by adding a Magazine, which is fair enough, or just by Kyosuke being badass.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> II</em>, where one sidequest has you help out (or blow up) a Mandalorian whose blaster rifle had run out of juice. One conversation option is to mock him for leaving all his spare ammo in his (lost) backpack, whereupon he angrily asks if <em>you've</em> ever had to reload in the middle of a fight. Since the game's magazines are bottomless, he has a point.
</li><li> Mercenaries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em> require ammo, but if they've got spare ammo when their current magazine runs out, they reload by themselves.
</li><li> Completely avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationFlashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationFlashpoint">Operation Flashpoint</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA">its sequels</a>. All guns in the game, including ones in vehicles or mounted on tripods, run out of ammunition. Reloading early moves that magazine to the end of the queue, and it's possible to end up loading that magazine again depending on how much ammo you expend and how often you reload.
</li><li> Unlike in most other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> games, gun ammo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulHackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulHackers">Soul Hackers</a></em> is finite and can be depleted.
</li><li> Partial exception: Reavers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> must build their own ammo (it costs money) and have a maximum number of shots they can hold at once.

Fortunately, if they run out, the unit in most cases needs only to stop fighting for a few seconds, while swimming a few meters toward the player's home base to replenish them.
</li><li> Partial exception: most units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> have infinite energy or ammunition for their guns, but tactical missile launchers, strategic missile launchers, and strategic missile submarines all need to be ordered to construct missiles. Considering how short the lifespan of most units in the game is, it's unlikely an ammunition limit for normal units would matter.
</li><li> The spiritual predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">says</a> that all non-nuclear-missile weapons in the game are actually energy weapons. This is quite noticeable with the long range artillery which take a big chunk of out of your energy reserves when fired.
</li><li> Partial exception: Energy weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em> require energy (a global resouce) to fire, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">some weapons</a> require the output of multiple fusion reactors to produce enough energy for continuous fire. Missiles and projectiles are unlimited, however.
</li><li> Averted in the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em>, where other than the laser weapons, all hand-held and all craft-mounted weapons have finite magazines, soldiers and craft have limited carrying space in which to cram replacement magazines, and you have to buy, build or scavenge replacement ammunition unless you want your entire organization to run out. As if that wasn't enough, you have to fund research to develop most of the weapons and equipment you'll be using.
<ul><li> Not only averted, but inverted in the original game - any magazine still loaded into a gun at the end of a mission could only be salvaged for reuse if it was still full (loose part-full mags were still scavenged) - meaning that, when ammo was tight, it was worth going round unloading all non-laser guns that had been fired during the mission when you got down to the last alien or two.
</li><li> <em>And</em> you had to specify where on the paper doll the various pieces of equipment were. If you put your mags on your belt, they cost less time to reload than ones put in the leg pockets of the cargo pants.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOAfterBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOAfterBlank">UFO After Blank</a></em> series goes in odd directions with this. Every weapon needs to be reloaded when it runs out of ammo. However, in the case of advanced technology (and weapons based on advanced technology), you can research larger mags to allow your soldiers to shoot longer. In the second and third game, not only do you have to make sure your soldiers have enough weapons, you also have to make sure they have enough ammo by manufacturing it. If you don't keep up with the expenditure (especially in <em>Afterlight</em>, where the time spent building ammo is almost always time you could better spend on more/better weapons or armor or whathaveyou), your soldiers will quickly have to start counting their rounds...and they never get good enough to hit consistently.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em>, while your operatives won't run out of ammo on ground missions anymore, they still have a limited number of rounds per magazine and need to reload.

Of course, it is then used to stab the last enemy, ejected, and replaced by a blade weapon and a machine gun that doesn't run out ammo..

<ul><li> During the campaign, enemies will always have unlimited ammo, though they have to reload (except for the GAU-21, which the enemies can fire endlessly). Mounted weapons actually <em>don't</em> have bottomless magazines (they generally hold 200 or so rounds), and if you activate the infinite ammo cheat, you still have to reload.

The default <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Mega/X Buster</a> plays the trope straight since it's connected to the user's power generator.
</li><li> Kind of played straight, kind of averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarkness">The Darkness</a></em>. Jackie is given a pair of guns for his birthday in the opening cutscene, but "ammo" for this weapon makes him pick up and use the guns of dead mooks instead.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSoldier">Alien Soldier</a></em>. Having to conserve your ammunition makes the game that much harder.

The weapons have been upgraded since the original to use "thermal clips" which are rapidly ejected from the weapon and thus bypass the original's cooling time. In-story and gameplay, it's an upgrade because players may continue shooting faster, but running out of thermal clips can definitely be a problem, especially on higher difficulties. And of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">Shepard is the only character who can ever run out of the things</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flashback">Flashback</a></em> a pistol has unlimited ammo.

Ammo is <em>incredibly</em> limited due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">the nature</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the setting</a>, which is part of what makes it so tense through much of the early and mid game. On top of that, ammo is also technically currency (the good, military-grade stuff at least, although the dirty metro-made handloads could be bartered) — all of it can be used on enemies, but all of it can also be used to trade for much-needed supplies and better weapons, even if they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">scratch-built improvised guns</a>.

While they need to reload, human enemies (and companions) have infinite magazines and can keep shooting until the cows come home (or until you die). This gets especially ludicrous on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Ranger Mode</a>, where enemies can keep firing as long as they please, then when you take them down you'll find at most five bullets on them.
</li></ul></li><li> Partially adverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleKingsStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleKingsStory">Little King's Story</a></em>. Animal Hunters have finite arrows (forty for each Hunter) and when they run out of them, they're pretty useless. However they all seem to share the same pool of arrows.
</li><li> Weapons in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> may as well have bottomless magazines, because just about every enemy drops ammo (and in larger amounts towards the end of the game) and you can find it scattered everywhere throughout the game. The game uses the same kind of ammo for handguns, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, etc. The one kind of ammo that is scarce, however, are rockets, which you'll only get a handful of throughout the game. Using the rocket launcher is only advised against very tough bosses.
</li><li> Most weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EYEDivineCybermancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EYEDivineCybermancy">E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy</a></em> have quite limited magazine sizes; players will reload frequently. Every set of two or three magazines takes up a spot in the player's inventory, so some planning is needed on how much ammunition will be required for every gun the user is taking - and indeed the choice of how many guns to take - with every gun in the player's inventory cutting into the ammunition space of the others.
</li><li> Curiously subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, of all games. The Sniper ejects a spent casing from his bolt action rifle after each shot, but is never seen loading a new bullet afterwards. However, in the promotional video "Meet the Sniper" it's shown that he actually holds a new bullet between his ring and index fingers before pulling the bolt and loads it into the barrel simultaneously alongside ejecting the old one.
<ul><li> Though for gameplay purposes it still has a bottomless magazine as he can switch to another weapon before the reloading completes, switch back to the sniper rifle, and it will still be able to fire immediately. In fact, immediately switching back and forth right after firing a round will let him fire slightly <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">faster</a></strong> than reloading normally (it saves slightly less than 1/5 of a second). The Flare Gun and its variants can also have the reload interrupted and fire as normal, but it can't be fired faster this way. In contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStraightAndArrowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStraightAndArrowPath">Huntsman and Crusader's Crossbow</a> have actual 1-arrow/bolt magazines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothingReloads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothingReloads">that must have their reloads completed without interruption before firing again.</a>
</li><li> Standing next to a dispenser effectively grants infinite ammo, since it replenishes your ammo faster than you can use it up. Strangely, sentries (built by engineers, just like dispensers) have limited ammo and can only be reloaded manually. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Why can't the engineer combine the two devices?</a>
</li><li> Potentially the case for the Engineer's Widowmaker shotgun. It uses 30 metal per shot but you get back metal equal to the damage you deal. So a good player can in theory fire infinitely so long as they do at least 30 damage per shot.
</li><li> Mann vs. Machine uses this as a gameplay mechanic. You are able to upgrade the clip size of each weapon, which seems ridiculous when your 9-shot shotgun still ejects only 2 shells to reload. Robots, on the other hands, have <em>truly</em> limitless ammo but regular-sized magazines (meaning they still have to reload once they empty their clips — cue the Giant Rapid Fire variant of whatever class, truly the stuff of nightmares). Frustratingly, the special Halloween mission has Pyro bots, whose weapon draws directly from its ammo supply without reloading, taking advantage of this to shooting fire <em>at all times</em> making playing as Spy much more difficult.
</li><li> The Righteous Bison and Cow Mangler 5000, despite being laser weapons, must be reloaded by pumping their mechanisms
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRuler">Star Ruler</a></em> averts this with kinetics; when designing your starships you must take into account how long they can fire with the ammo stocks they have on board and add more ammo caches if they do not pack enough. Or you could design dedicated ammo colliers and send them with your expeditionary forces, but best hope the enemy doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">shoot them first...</a> Energy weapons on the other hand have no such problems, giving you a reason to put time into improving them. Later research allows you to unlock the Matter Generator, which can generate ammo; with a high enough research level you can generate more ammo than you expend, conforming to this trope again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontlinesFuelOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontlinesFuelOfWar">Frontlines: Fuel of War</a></em> averts this, and doesn't give you much ammo to begin with for some loadouts. Your assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper classes had comfortable ammo slings, but your machine-gunner and submachine gun classes have precious little of it. Your pistol has infinite ammo, but it's largely ineffective; infinite ineffectiveness only gets you so far! Even vehicles can run out of ammo, but they have a suitably large amount of it. This does tend to reduce the horrifying effects that a good tank-driver, jet- or helicopter-pilot can do by a small amount. Once they've reloaded at the airfield, though...
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TERA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TERA">TERA</a> online</em> with archers - the class description states that arrows are outright magical. Not only that, the bowstring on their weapons is not even real - as in, it's a string of arcane energy.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagon">Amagon</a></em>: Amagon uses a machine gun as his weapon, but it only has 300 bullets to start out with.
</li><li> The entirety of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> franchise, where characters possess limited ammunition and usually attack with other methods, such as with the gun's bayonet, to conserve ammunition (1 and 2) or have to at least spend a turn reloading after firing a few shots (3 onwards).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em> series the HUD implies that the weapons use limited magazines, displaying ten or twenty rounds below the current weapon's overall ammo count. These deplete with each shot fired, and refill when empty. Actual gameplay completely ignores this, however, letting you constantly fire until you run out of ammo. The trope is played totally straight with turrets and vehicle mounted weapons (turrets do overheat, though).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MAXMechanizedAssaultAndExploration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MAXMechanizedAssaultAndExploration">M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault &amp; Exploration</a></em> has a limited amount of ammunition for all vehicles and turrets. You need supply trucks or a visit to the depot to reload vehicles, though if turrets are connected to a supply source, they will reload automatically.
<ul><li> The sequel does away with ammunition and supply connectors all together for a more streamlined gameplay.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the guns on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceStation13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceStation13">Space Station 13</a></em> are energy weapons, but security officers' tasers and the energy guns and laser rifles carried in the armory only have a handful of shots before they need to be plugged into a recharger (same with the stun baton). Only the captain's personal laser (which is a possible target for traitors to steal) has unlimited ammo, but it needs time to recharge.
<ul><li> For projectile weapons, they need to be reloaded regularly and it can be a pain with the clunky interface: weapons with a detachable magazine or speedloader needs to have the empty magazine ejected or casings removed (by clicking on it) and the new magazine or speedloader transferred to an empty hand and THEN into the gun to reload it. The bartender's double-barrel shotgun needs both shells loaded into it one at a time (and fresh shells and spent shells look identical, so it's possible for someone to scavenge "new ammo" and find that it's already been fired), and the syringe gun available in Medbay needs to have a new syringe loaded after each shot....which has to have been loaded with whatever drug the shooter wants beforehand. A good syringe gun user will have a medical belt loaded with syringes (typically tranquilizer or poison) and a bottle or two of extra drugs in their pockets BEFORE getting into a fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em>, neither you nor the enemy has an infinite supply of missiles or drones. Energy weapons never run out, though.
</li><li> Mostly averted in several versions of an old DOS game based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise. Your spaceship continually generates power for its energy weapons and shields, but has only nine missile weapons and it's possible to use up energy much faster than it can be generated. Docking at a space station replenishes both energy and missiles. There is an emergency procedure to gain more energy, but this often results in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">Explosive Overclocking</a></em>.
</li><li> Even leaving aside the obvious aversion of this trope for the player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Receiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Receiver">Receiver</a></em> (not only are your magazines limited, you have to manually reload them yourself), the machinegun turrets only carry about fifteen rounds each. That said, trying to run them out of bullets is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">awfully dicey</a>...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirgeOfCerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a></em> you can equip your guns with an auto reload contraption so you can shoot until you really run out of ammos (very useful when you sacrifice mag space for power or range)
</li><li> Not only do all units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MenOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MenOfWar">Men of War</a></em> need to reload their weapons, but they all have limited ammo (even vehicles and stationary guns). It's very common to send your soldiers to scavenge fresh ammo from both friendly and enemy corpses, or loot ammo crates and wrecked vehicles for fresh tank and mortar shells. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmo">Universal Ammo</a> means that all submachine guns use the same ammo, all machine guns (including vehicle ones) use the same ammo, all tanks and anti-tank guns use the same shells etc. So you'll never end up totally bereft as long as there are corpses, crates, and armored cars to rifle through.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em>, one of the weapons you can unlock for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Extra New Game</a> is the Unlimited Sub Machine Gun. It's as hilariously broken as it sounds.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> titles that include firearms: the player character has to reload their guns after every use and have limited ammunition. Enemies also have to reload after each use but conceivably have infinite ammo (such as during the Bunker Hill sequence in <em>Assassin's Creed III</em> in which there is a large mass of soldiers in firing lines who will fire at the opposite side forever, but have to reload each time. Non-gunpowder weapons (such as throwing knives, bows, and blowguns) don't have reload times but <em>do</em> have limited ammunition. Enemies, however, get unlimited arrows.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em>, it's possible to catch a guard needing to reload his gun, but it may just be a random occurrence that happens once if he does it.
</li><li> In the original version of <em>Viper Phase 1</em>, special weapons avert this trope, reverting back to the infinite-use standard shot once the weapon meter empties. The "New Version" gives special weapons infinite ammo, playing this trope straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt">Elemental Gearbolt</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightGunGame">Light Gun Game</a> whose setting fantasy setting lets it eschew ammo and reloading.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> you use when escaping from a concentration camp plays this straight with both its laser gun <em>and</em> rocket launcher.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> series makes an aversion with this as many weapons run with ammo stores that can only be reloaded via hopping back onto your battleship or having a dedicated unit resupply you. This gets weird in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punches</a> and Getter Tomahawk Boomerangs, usually only energy-powered or infinite spamming, run on the trope.
</li><li> During regular gameplay in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a></em> your guns will always run out of ammo, unless you pick up more guns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em> licensed game Aragorn gets 40 arrows, Legolas 60 and Gimli has 20 axes. Enemy archers will never run out of arrows, however.
</li><li> An odd mix of aversion and straight invocation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>. Scouts, troopers and engineers have a limited amount of ammunition in their magazines, but an unlimited number of magazines. The same applies for armor-piercing shells and machine gun ammo for the tanks. But the lancers, snipers, and mortar and smoke rounds for the tanks are all explicitly in finite supply, as are grenades. One round of all expendable ammunition magically replaces itself every phase. Also, engineers appear to have an infinite supply of reloads for everyone else that they can pass along whenever they want.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldiersOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldiersOfAnarchy">Soldiers of Anarchy</a></em>. <em>Every</em> single weapon in the game has limited ammunition, from pistols to tank guns. Even worse, all vehicle weapons except the Humvee M60 and Humvee Plamya grenade launcher can only be reloaded in the base between missions, by virtue of the ammo being too heavy for infantry to carry.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Westerado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Westerado">Westerado</a></em>, you will never run out of bullets, but this won't stop you from having to reload once all six chambers of a revolver are emptied. Plus, you have to reload it bullet-by-bullet.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, where you have model guns that act like real ones in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld">Mental World</a> of the Palace. But despite not having <em>any</em> actual bullets in them, you can still only fire a certain amount of ammo before you run out and have to reload.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered">Sundered</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Valkyrie Cannon</a>a very powerful plasma gunhas a (very) limited amount of ammo and can only be reloaded by picking up somewhat rare ammo drops (which each restore a single unit of ammo). The Bullet Transfabricator Perk allows the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoke</a> this trope in a limited fashion, as it regenerates the Cannons ammo, one unit at a time, in set intervals.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guacamelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Guacamelee">Guacamelee!</a></em> with Flame Face, who has a bad habit of wildly firing his guns into the air/ground, to the point that his first two attempts at boss fights are postponed because he used all his ammo on that and has nothing left to use on the player. Eventually played straight by the time his boss fight finally comes around, where he's apparently finally brought enough ammo to never have to worry about running out.
</li><li> Zigzags in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> games. Averted for the most powerful ranged weapon — bows need arrows. Magical arrows are rare, but plenty of non-magical arrows can be picked off dead enemies or bought in a friendly civilized area. Number of arrows in a single inventory slot is unlimited and their weight doesn't matter. Played straight for weaker slings (supposedly rocks are everywhere) and chatkchas (thri-kreen thrown propellers).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AkaneTheKunoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AkaneTheKunoichi">Akane the Kunoichi</a></em>, Akane never runs out of kunais to throw, and can easily go through hundreds. Enemies don't run out either, although their rate of fire is low enough that it's less conspicuous.
</li><li> When Kirby copies Inkling's Splattershot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, he'll eventually run out of the ink used as ammo. However, he can't turn into a squid to recharge like Inklings can, so he automatically lose the ability when he runs out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em> in 1994 was an early example of an FPS putting ammo limits on all guns. Reloading also isn't automatic and has to be done manually via the game's... archaic user interface, which can screw you over if you aren't keeping track. It also averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a>.
</li><li> Your units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline">Girls Frontline</a></em> have limited ammo supplies; they have room for five units of Ammo, and they spend one every time they get into a gun fight. To resupply them, you must either move them into a Heliport space or back to your Command Center and use the Resupply action (which costs one Action Point), or end your turn with your squad in one of such spaces. If they get into a gun fight with no Ammo, their performance will be crippled.
</li><li> The video game adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrowCityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrowCityOfAngels">The Crow: City of Angels</a></em> has a very unfair zigzagging of this trope. All of the enemies with firearms come out with guns already drawn carrying unlimited ammo, while you need to pick up guns and ammo off the ground before you can fire, and you only get a few shots before running out of ammo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAndTheWaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAndTheWaves">The Wolf And The Waves</a></em>: While in human form, you can throw infinite rocks (except in the tutorial, where you run out so the game can showcase your wolf form.)

<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers">Darwin's Soldiers</a></em>. The characters spend a fair amount of time reloading and several of their enemies have been killed because they ran out of ammo.
</li><li> Averted and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMercuryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMercuryMen">The Mercury Men</a></em>. Although The Leagues zap-gun-of-choice - the <em>Lumiére</em> - resembles a modified six-shot revolver, so at first glance this trope appears to be played straight, the blueprints on their website reveal that each of the six glowing <em>mercury pin</em> bullets is actually good for 24 shots, for a total of 144 energy blasts per full reload.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a></em> universe story "<a class="urllink" href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-orientation">UIU Orientation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". The instructor shows the new recruits an anomalous Desert Eagle magazine which normally contains seven bullets, but this one contains eight... nine... ten... eleven... he passes it around, and the recruits each manage to pull out some more bullets. No, it's not infinite - it has a maximum capacity of 1,296 bullets. The previous owner found this out the hard way when he ran out of ammo in a gunfight.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzhVAJOHgQo">Cereal Killer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a short by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RocketJump">Rocket Jump</a>.

The robbers, most notably the last one, do have the ability to shoot more, but that's because their guns have a higher bullet capacity and they can reload when Freddie isn't looking.

<ul><li> In "Dark Heart", the Batplane runs out of missiles.
</li><li> In "Patriot Act", when Green Arrow and Speedy fight General Eiling, they run out of arrows and Green Arrow humorously steals a couple of them from Speedy's quiver.
</li><li> In "Destroyer", Batman runs out of Batarangs. Lex Luthor offers him a gun, but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeGuns">instead</a> resorts to hand to hand combat.
</li></ul></li><li> The Avalon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Arc</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a>.</em> Elisa empties her handgun at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and for the rest of the adventure is handicapped by not having more ammo for it. Several times during the arc, she pulls her gun in reflex to a threat, only to remember she's out of shots.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, in which early on, Odd is equipped with a certain amount of "Lazer Arrows", and once he's out, he's out until Jérémie restocks his arrows. Through Season 1, barely any episode went by without Odd running out of arrows at some point. Jérémie, however, is eventually able in Season 2 to upgrade Odd's virtual form, enabling his gloves to hold 10,000 arrows apiece.
<ul><li> Played straight in "False Start", however, where Jim uses a nail gun to fight Xana's monsters, and never has to reload it.
</li></ul></li><li> There's one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> sketch, based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">the fable about the scorpion and the frog</a>, where the frog pulls out a revolver and shoots at the scorpion twice when it tries to sting him. When a gerbil on the other side asks for his help again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">promising not to crawl into his anus</a>, the frog pulls the trigger six times  four shots and two clicks.
<ul><li> Another sketch parodies The Tortoise and the Hare with a movie-western style gunfight. The hare has enough time to empty his guns before the tortoise even reaches his. Unfortunately, bullets don't bounce off hares.
</li></ul></li><li> Hawkeye in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> goes through arrows at a rapid pace and repeatedly finds himself with an empty quiver in mid-action. He usually doesn't seem to have much trouble resupplying himself <em>between</em> fights, but right in the middle of one...
</li><li> Averted and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> several times. Apparently Lana combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">A-Team Firing</a> enough that she earned the name "Spray and Pray" Lana, as well as having about 10 seconds of combat effectiveness with a gun. Archer also had several instances where he had to remind people that, no, his handgun does not hold more than 7 bullets and, yes, they get emptied very fast.
<ul><li> Archer himself uses this trope to his advantage due to a preternatural ability to not only keep track of how many bullets he has fired, but how many his opponents have fired as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: While most akumas play this trope straight, the Collector is an exception. His book can absorb anything that touches it or that he touches with it, but each thing stored uses up a page, and once they're all filled he can't absorb anything else until he takes the time to clear some pages.
