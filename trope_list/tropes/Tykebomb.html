This means putting an immense amount of potential power into the hands of a wildly inappropriate user, usually a young child.
</p><p>These villains would probably be more effective if said creations were not typically abused or treated badly by villains who insist they exist to serve their master, rather than being coddled and praised; thus they tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSentientWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSentientWeapon">sympathetic</a>.

</p><p>Notably this trope is derived from real life, as many cultures took to training elite warriors from an early age. Medieval knights were commonly trained from early boyhood by a Knight mentor (the word <em>boy</em> is even derived from a word for "servant").

</li><li> It turns out that the only shifters who <em>aren't</em> this are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren, Ymir and maybe the Warhammer Titan. The other shifters are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> trained by the Marley military with the sole purpose of inheriting one of the powers of the Nine Titans. Shifters have a time limit of 13 years, after which they die. If the powers aren't transferred to another person before this, a random Eldian baby gets them. Children between the ages of 5 and 7 can apply, and the strongest inherit whichever powers are up for grabs. This is how the above-mentioned Annie, Reiner and Bertolt came to get their powers, along with the Beast Titan Zeke and the Cart Titan Pieck. The Jaw Titan was originally possessed by Marcel, who obtained it through the military programme, but he was eaten by Ymir, who eventually ended up "returning" the Jaw Titan to Marcel's brother Porco. The next batch of children are currently in the process of training, as time is running out for the current Marley-controlled shifters. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pcx2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0pcx2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pcx2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Marley control the Armored, Beast, Cart and Jaw Titans. They used to own the Colossal and Female Titans, but those are currently on Paradis Island with the main characters. The Warhammer Titan is controlled by the Tybur family, who reside within the Kingdom of Marley, but the military doesn't appear to have direct control. The Attack Titan's (Eren's Titan) allegiance isn't exactly known, and the Founding Titan had always resided within the Reiss family, who lived on Paradis until Grisha slaughtered all but one of them and passed it down to his younger son, who couldn't use its power due to him not being of royal blood.</span></span>

<ul><li> Piccolo can be considered one. When King Piccolo died in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, he spat out Piccolo (jr)'s egg and ensured that all his memories and drive to kill Goku was implanted in it. So one could say Piccolo was brainwashed to carry out his sire's wishes from the day he was born, and Gohan (Goku's son) unwittingly defused him.
</li><li> In the Saiyan Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Piccolo kidnapped and trained Son Gohan for a year to be a tykebomb against the oncoming Saiyans. However, he grew fond of Gohan over the year, and although Gohan was vital (and would especially be in later sagas), the Saiyans were too strong and it ended up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Piccolo sacrificing himself to save the boy.</a> Krillin even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">Lampshades</a> the idea when Piccolo kidnaps Gohan.
<div class="indent"><strong>Krillin</strong>: If Gohan survives he'll turn out like Piccolo!
</div></li><li> Played a little more straight with Frieza taking on Vegeta as a child. Admittedly, Vegeta decided to switch sides a bit prematurely and thus wasn't exactly a threat to Frieza when he did, but when you consider the fact that Frieza's eventual demise was at the hands of Vegeta's son, the whole thing still seems rather ill-advised on Frieza's part.
</li><li> Played even straighter with Son Goku - sent to Earth as an toddler with the intention that he would wipe out the inhabitants as he grew up. Derailed when he fell of a cliff and hit his head in an accident, "defusing" him. That is what is widely believed. In <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> it is revealed that Goku was sent to Earth for his protection. Although, he was still horribly violent and often attacked the senior Gohan.
</li><li> In general, all Saiyans children are raised as tykebombs. Raditz was considered a full-fledged warrior at five or seven and Goku was old enough to be a Frontier Baby at three. Part of the reason why Goku was sent to Earth was because no one would care if he wiped the planet.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eight members of the secret government organization Cipher Pol #9, were trained from young ages the martial arts known as Rokushiki (Japanese for "six powers"), pushing their bodies to superhuman levels for the purpose of carrying out covert assassinations in the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">World Government</a>. Most notable of the group is Rob Lucci: so fearful that legends have been made of him from his efficiency, coldness and brutality to the point that it not only was believed he was the least likely of the group to ever be defeated, but can survive a Buster Call, which to put into perspective <em>razed an island</em>.
</li><li> Even the protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, and his brother, Portgas D. Ace, were technically examples of this trope. At least with Luffy, it was revealed that his inhuman strength, stamina and outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> status was the result of his grandfather, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marine Vice-Admiral</span> Garp throwing into deep ravines, cliffs and exposing him to high altitudes by <em>tying him up to helium balloons</em>, all for the purpose of making him a strong Marine (likewise with Ace). Ironically, when Garp's back was turned (<em>for several years</em>, apparently) they ran off to become powerful pirates which even caught the World Government's attention. Had Lucci known that Luffy was trained by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vice-Admiral</span> Garp, maybe he wouldn't have taken him so lightly, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">then it wouldn't seem such a surprise when he rises from your best attack ready to retaliate</a>.
</li><li> Trafalgar Law was born in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the city of Flevance, which was poisoned by the Amber Lead mined there. The rest of the world mistook the poisoning for a plague and walled the city off, after which war erupted and everyone was killed except Law, who snuck out by <em>hiding in piles of dead bodies</em> when he was only ten. He then joined the Donquixote Pirates to kill as many people as possible before his disease killed him. He was somewhat defused by Doflamingo's brother Rocinante, but Doflamingo killing Rocinante put Law on the path for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> at age thirteen, and thirteen years later he comes to collect.</span>
</li><li> Donquixote pirates are very fond of this trope. In addition to Law (mentioned above), Vergo, Buffalo and Baby 5 joined the gang when they were kids, and Dellinger was raised by the gang from infancy.
</li><li> Doflamingo himself is an interesting example. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Trebol saw potential in him and purposefully raised him for his goals, but instead of a soldier, he was trying to create a future boss who would lead his gang to power.

Sanji and his quadruplet brothers in particular were modified in utero to be born without empathy. Sanji's mother, Sora, tried to reverse this with a genetic drug that only saved Sanji at the cost of herself, which resulted in Sanji failing to make any progress, as he remained a regular human being thanks to the drug. Because of that, he was disowned and abused. His siblings, on the other hand, were stark successes, but only Sanji's sister, Reiju, has enough empathy to comprehend her family's depraved actions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled">and hates herself for it</a>.</span>

Sadly this is just about the only tactic still effective against the 17 Beasts, as the only other weapons capable of killing the monsters are over 500 years old and badly in need of repair. The high attrition rates mean that few Leprechauns live past their early teens. This somewhat changes with the arrival of the main character who, due to being frozen for 500 years, actually has the knowledge to repair the ancient beast killing weapons. As a result the military is able to change its tactics and no longer resort to suicide based magic attacks.

These flashbacks show how she was frequently deprived of things normal children received, such as various treats and foods, playing with friends, or even parental affection, with only occasional indulgences from a knight who served as her butler. This is why, for all this is touted as why the Princess would be able to resist conventional torture, she so frequently succumbs to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">Poke the Poodle</a> "tortures" of the Hellhorde; they generally consist of offering those things she was denied: foods she was never allowed to try, video games or trips to the playground with friends, even maternal love in one case.

Askellad kept him around because he was impressed by the boy's guts, and it allowed Thorfinn to grow up into a formidable fighter over the years. With his specialty in stealth and agility thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedPowerhouse">small stature,</a> he was often tasked on scouting and assassination missions by Askellad with the reward being giving the boy a chance to kill him in a one-on-one duel.

This life doesn't prevent possible unrelated awesomeness even for ones far enough from any human norms, but apparently more often than not it sucks to be a Neogene. This may have something to do with the head of this project (and consequently the true purpose) being batshit insane.
</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Ryuji Otogi (probably known better by his dub name, Duke Devlin) was raised from birth by his father to exact revenge against Yugi's grandfather for a Dark Game that he had lost, causing him to age several decades in one night as a result. Otogi never realized this plan until he was actually coerced into challenging Yugi to Dungeon Dice Monsters, and his father's plan ultimately failed. (The story was changed considerably in the anime; in fact, the story in the manga probably offers a more logical explanation for Otogi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> than the anime did, something that fans of the anime often had a problem with.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> The third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl</a>, Cassandra Cain was trained from a young age to be an assassin. She was horrified by her first kill, and ran away. She subsisted on the streets, until encountering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> and his allies.
</li><li> Similarly with Damian Wayne, Bruce and Talia's son. He was trained from an early age to be a warrior. The difference between him and Cassandra is that she was treated as a weapon. Damian was treated as a <em>prince</em>, spoiled rotten and able to do whatever he wants. Even as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a>, he's the most violent, surpassing even Jason Todd. Of course, spending time with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Dick</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Grayson</a> (who he initially served as Robin under, not Bruce) has softened him up quite a bit.
</li><li> Before he met Batman and became the titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batwing">Batwing</a></em>, David Zavimbe was a frighteningly effective child soldier.

Also implied in a less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">creepy</a> fashion with those supes whose powers were the result of pre-natal/parental exposure to the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a>, with foster parents raising and training them in a manner reminiscent of the culture around (child) beauty pageants.
<ul><li> In fact, the trope is the major reason for its plot. We learn that Homelander (whose ficitional backstory is that of Superman's) was raised in a lab with a nuke set to blow if he got out of hand. Vought thought ahead for once and looked for a way to neutralize him in adulthood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So they created a clone and raised it from birth to kill him, called him Black Noir. Problem is, since BN's literally only purpose in life is to kill the Homelander, he started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">gaslighting</a> him so he'd go insane, finally allowing BN's life to have a purpose.</span>

The Margrave entices young, unhappy boys with lies and gifts, give them a fancy uniform and neat badges. And then send them back to their parents to <em>explode</em>. A few of them can put themselves back together afterwards, but the Margrave doesn't seem too concerned about those who don't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dreadstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dreadstar">Dreadstar</a>'s daughter was a very straight example, and a major plot point of the second series.

In at least one story, the age is stated as 5 years old. Additionally, Justice Department has a cloning program to revive what were believed to be outstanding judges. Dredd himself was cloned from the first Chief Judge, so the <em>whole reason</em> for his existence was to fight crime.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, the backstory of Hit-Girl was that she was over-trained at an early age by her vigilante-minded father to grow up akin to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>.

The motivation for turning his daughter into a killing machine was not revenge, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeBadass">simple fun</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>:

</li><li> This was Demagol's big pet project. He wanted tried to take DNA from Master Arca, an Arkanian Jedi and grow his own test tube Jedi for the Mandalorian war effort. He spliced master Arca's genes into children and sent them off to the Crucible to be trained. Jareal was one of the children from this program.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a></em> and Gamora. Thanos raised a daughter from childhood to have a perfect assassin. As a subversion he did try to otherwise be a decent father to her, though she rebelled anyway.
</li><li> One issue of the limited series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Muties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Muties">Muties</a></em> featured a boy named Riek who suddenly developed the ability to manipulate time while serving with a Lord's Resistance Army expy.
</li><li> Michana Loomis in <em>Nexus</em>. Paradoxically, despite her older sister Stacy's best efforts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykeBomb">laser-guide</a> her, she ended up saving Horatio from Stan in their final confrontation.
<ul><li> Also Horatio's own daughters, since they were conceived by Ursula expressly for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">inheriting Horatio's powers</a>, and raised by her to be warriors. They ended being good anyway though, and saved Horatio from the Loomis sisters.
</li></ul></li><li> The original members of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> were bred to take over for their parents, to inherit the Earth and their parents' power. It did not go well. For irony, the children rebelled <em>because</em> their parents had treated them well, since the children grew up with healthy consciences. Thus, they wanted no truck with parents who ritually murdered other teenagers and were willingly serving monsters who intended to wipe out all life on Earth.
</li><li> More literal tykebombs existed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinestroCorpsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinestroCorpsWar">Sinestro Corps War</a></em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comic books. The so-called "Children of the White Lobe" are psychokinetic children raised from birth to be fanatical terrorist suicide bombers, and who make use of a mineral that becomes extremely explosive when stimulated by psionic powers such as their own—usually by swallowing a small chunk and then setting it off when the time is right.
</li><li> Most Sith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy">Star Wars: Legacy</a></em>. Specifically Darth Talon, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Tyke Sex Bomb</a>.
</li><li> Subverted by some incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Bizarro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Bizarro">Bizarro</a> who is often created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> to serve as a weapon against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, but the backwards creature is usually too uncontrollable to be an effective minion.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red Skull</span> seemed to be heading down this path in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Universe</a> - the illegitimate son of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a></span>, he was taken from his mother and raised by the United States military, and proved to be leaps and bounds a better soldier than even his father... And then he killed everyone on the compound and cut off his own face. At <em>seventeen</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a> is practically the tykebomb poster child. She deconstructs the Child Assassin archetype by showing just how much such an upbringing would actually mess up a young child literally raised to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanWeapon">Human Weapon</a>: She suffers severe, bordering on suicidal depression, and struggles to interact with others in normal social situations. She's <em>so</em> conditioned to following orders that when Logan kicks her off X-Force (which she only joined because she interpreted Cyclops' invitation as an order) to prevent her from being damaged further, she <em>breaks down in tears</em> because she's mentally and emotionally incapable of making her own decisions.
</li><li> The Jack O'Lantern featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a></em> was kidnapped by Crime-Master when he was a child and trained to become an assassin.

<ul><li> When Shinji and Asuka start spending time with Rei, they realize many alarming facts about her which explain her weirdness: she doesn't remember her mother, she was taken in and raised by Gendo, she's no friends or life outside of NERV, she's being forced to take drugs which keep her unemotional and submissive, she's been instructed to be completely and unwaveringly loyal to Commander Ikari, obeying his orders to the letter and without hesitation, she would kill herself if she was ordered to do so... They are so horrified that they help her to cut her puppet strings.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rei</strong>: "I thought you disliked me, because I was a 'doll'." <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: "Well... yeah. I did. But it's a lot harder to blame you for acting that way now that I know you're drugged like this. That's why I reacted so strongly... my step-mother tried something like that with pills when I was younger. I know what it's like. It's not like I think you would kill yourself or something just because Commander Ikari ordered you to or such." <br/><strong>Rei</strong>: "If I was ordered to do so, I would." <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: "What?! Are you crazy? Why?" <br/><strong>Rei</strong>: "He has raised me for years. He cares for me. If he gave that order, I would trust he had a necessary reason for it... He is all I have."

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, as part of the ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morrigan proposes an alternative way to destroy the Archdemon without using a Grey Warden to trap its spirit after its dragon body has been killed. She will get herself pregnant by a Grey Warden so that she can destroy the dragon and the demon will be trapped in the growing child. Her only condition is, that she will disappear right after the Archdemon is destroyed and nobody will try to look for her, while she keeps the child and raises it. Since an archdemon is really a corrupted Old God, the child would be incredible powerful, whatever it might turn out to become. It's also worth considering that the whole thing was the idea of Flemeth. She is unique in having her spirit merge with that of a demon who possessed her, while still remaining her own self, and also one of the most powerful mages who ever lived. To prolong her life, she transfers her spirit into that of her daughters, and had the archdemon appeared a generation later, she would have done the ritual to create a child in with the Old God is bound. That child would have been a nuclear tyke arsenal.</span>
</li><li> This tykebomb is defused in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flemeth's goal is revealed to be revenge: the demon gods who ruled the world were "betrayed" (and not by the dread wolf, who was a loyal ally); the more demon gods (like the archdemon's soul) she can rally, the better her odds. If Morrigan sires a child, Flemeth offers them a choice: let the boy be raised by Flemeth, or be eternally hounded by Flemeth (bonus points if Morrigan drinks from the Well of Mythal, since Mythal is the demon goddess who can control anyone who drinks from her well <em>and is the demon who is possessing Flemeth</em>). Morrigan immediately chooses the later... and Flemeth takes out the part of the kid that makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>, no physical harm done, and leaves.</span>

Some Argonian tribes take their duty of producing Shadowscales to such a degree that they have created potions which allow females to synchronize their egg-laying cycle with the Shadow constellation. This is Justified in-universe as the Hist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree">sentient</a> and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniscient">omniscient</a> trees which the Argonians worship in their Black Marsh homeland, are said to "acknowledge" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Sithis</a> as the original creator of the universe. This would also help explain the Shadowscales, as the Dark Brotherhood operates in service to Sithis. However, by the 4th Era (the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">only one Shadowscale remains</a>.

</li><li> Sephiroth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was engineered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Shinra</a> scientists to be the perfect soldier, implanted in the womb with alien DNA to endow him with superhuman strength and intelligence. The procedure killed his mother in childbirth, though she remained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>. He was then raised by his "surrogate" father (who never told him they were actually related) and grew up to be one of the world's most famed war heroes... until he discovered (most of) his secret origins, went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, and decided to destroy the planet and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">become a god</a> in the process. He damn near succeeded.</span>
</li><li> Sephiroth's remnant, Kadaj, also qualifies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Sephiroth's defeat, he wills this guy (and two others) into existence with the mentality and appearance of a teenager, for the purpose of insinuating Reunion and bringing Ol' Seph back from the Lifestream, and sacrificing his own body in the process.

The playable cast are all members of Class Zero, an elite squad of fourteen teenagers with special powers, each of whom was taken from their parents at an early age and trained to master a particular weapon. As a result, they're devastating in battle but have little understanding of civilian life, to the point that learning about anything besides combat seems foreign to them. In part due to this, they're isolated from their peers but form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">a close-knit group among each other.</a>

Among these children, Millia Rage became the dog that bit back, only it's kind of subverted in that she somehow saw a life beyond killing the whole time. The exact specifics of that waver due to the games' plots not being as import as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">rock and metal references.</a>
</li><li> For an example made by the good guys, the main character and the rest of the Spartan-IIs of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series were trained as warriors from the age of six and have been continually fighting since they were fourteen, but at least they were intended to survive into adulthood. The Spartan-IIIs, however, were purposely trained to be prepubescent suicide troops: only a handful of Alpha and Beta Company survived past childhood, mostly the ones who were considered gifted enough to be transferred to more elite units. Of those who remained in Beta, only two survived, while no one who stayed in Alpha made it.
</li><li> Cole McGrath, the hero from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous">inFAMOUS</a></em> could count as one, as Kessler set him up since his birth to make it so he could fight the Beast.
</li><li> The big plot twist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your character</span> is a Tyke Bomb raised, trained, and manipulated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Master Li</a> </span> as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a> to destroy all of his enemies and take control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> features several such characters:
<ul><li> Xion is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a replica of the series protagonist, Sora, whose purpose is to serve the Organization and prevent Sora from waking up to defeat them.</span>
</li><li> Riku Replica is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">that's right</a>, a replica of Riku created to turn Sora against the real Riku and become a tool for the Organization.
</li><li> After finding Sora's Nobody, Roxas, newly spawned and with no memory, the Organization indoctrinates him to serve their goals with the hope of him eventually replacing the original Sora entirely.
</li><li> Ienzo is an example of this to a lesser degree. He was an orphan that Ansem took in, who regarded Ansem as a father figure and turned out to be a child prodigy. When Ansem's other students betrayed him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they lie to Ienzo (still a child and the youngest founding member by far) that Ansem had abandoned them, so that they could use his research in a quest for power and to further slander their former teacher.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, there's several protagonist tykebombs: Jack, a homicidal ball of rage who was abducted by Cerberus as an infant and transformed into the most powerful human biotic; Thane, who was trained as an assassin from age six; and Grunt, a tank-grown Krogan mega-soldier, who is as violent as he sounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> does this a lot, although it usually deals with the psychological repercussions, too.

</li><li> Meanwhile, Revolver Ocelot (ADAM), called "Adamska" by his fellow Russians, as well as Big Mama (EVA). Both were trained from young ages to be Super Soldiers, as well as to blend perfectly into various nationalities. Ocelot, being half-Russian and -American, could act as a spy for either country with relative ease. EVA, meanwhile was raised by the Chinese and trained to act and speak flawlessly like an American. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheLastDaysOfFoxhound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheLastDaysOfFoxhound">The Last Days of FOXHOUND</a></em>, this is spoofed with Ocelot's lines: "I've been working for [The Philosophers] since I was born," and "I've been trained to be an X-Tuple agent from the age of four."
</li><li> Big Mama's resistance group consists entirely of war orphans whose only goal in life is to fight without anyone's interests.

The Minions eventually found him and brought him back to the Netherworld. Then Gnarl raised him for 13 years to become the Overlord that they needed. The <em>Minions</em> being in charge of his early development goes a long way to explaining why the new Overlord is more explicitly evil than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his canonically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> father, the previous Overlord</span>.

<ul><li> Mewtwo deserves another mention. Its story in the games involves it being the embryo of a pregnant Mew. Mewtwo was tampered and gene-spliced until it turned vicious and was made into a battling machine. It later went berserk and destroyed Dr. Fuji's Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island. It then took shelter in Cerulean Cave (a place both it and Mew seem naturally attracted to).

He infected many children with the Progenitor Virus, the original mutagenic virus that spawned all of Umbrella's other horrors, and indoctrinated them with his values. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Albert Wesker was one of the only survivors.</span> He didn't take it well when he found out he was essentially manufactured and thus never really had any control over his own life.
<ul><li> Interestingly, Spencer manages to avoid most of the mistakes mentioned in the second paragraph of the page description. Instead of relying on abuse and torture like many examples, his manipulation was much more subtle, to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wesker</span> had no idea that he even was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> and believed all his actions to be of his own free will when they were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">all according to Spencer's plan.</a> The only mistake Spencer made was not realising that someone brought up to be ruthless and ambitious might decide to take over the world himself instead of helping Spencer do so.

However, the project was a failure: more than half of the children who learned to use their powers successfully were hideously disfigured by their medication, and the others were judged far too disconnected from the outside world to be of any immediate military use.
<ul><li> Plus, in a subversion of standard Tykebomb fare, the research staff treated the Zener Children very well, and continued to do so even after the project's funding was cut.

</li><li> The season two finale reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Terry McGinnis</a> is this to Bruce Wyane</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hana, Ron's adoptive baby sister in the 4th season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>. In the prophecies about her, she's even called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">the weapon</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yakone raising his sons, Tarrlok and Noatak, as his instruments of revenge on Aang and Republic City by teaching them Bloodbending and drilling this idea into their heads. Even though Noatak betrays him, ironically, it works. Tarrlok becomes a corrupt councilman and Noatak becomes Amon.</span>
</li><li> Season 2 introduces us to Eska and Desna, Korra's twin cousins; while they were not <em>explicitly</em> raised this way by their father, Unaloq, they're incredibly powerful Waterbenders who are emotionally detached from everything, and almost blindly loyal to their father's plans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually they tire of it and help the heroes stop their father</span>.
</li><li> If the twins count, then Korra herself certainly counts as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenzin and Tonraq</span> may have <em>intended</em> to have her trained as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> from early childhood for her own protection rather than as a means by which to turn her into a tool to use for personal gain, but the end result was effectively identical. Korra's own temperamental affinity for violence probably had something to do with it, but either way the result wasn't pretty — she grew into a perfect weapon who believed she had no value outside of her powers and responsibilities, and she essentially failed to mature emotionally and spiritually past the age of four as a result (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">sometimes terrifying consequences</a>). Korra's character arc in Books One and Two essentially involves her figuring out how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefusingTheTykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefusingTheTykeBomb">defuse</a> herself and exist as her own person outside of her predetermined role (and even then, she can be pretty ruthless for a good guy!).
</li><li> In Book 3, we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Red Lotus attacked Korra when she was little in an attempt to kidnap her and train her, molding her to their way of thinking. They wanted her to grow up with the aim of overthrowing world leaders and "restoring the world to its natural state of disorder."</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Daughters of Aku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> were trained from birth to hunt down and kill Jack, undergoing brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> at the hands of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">mother</a>.
<ul><li> Jack himself is a benevolent version and even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>, as his father arranged for him to train with different fighters around the world if/when Aku broke free. At the same time though, he befriended the various tutors and people, gaining appreciation for the cultures and many of his experiences with his friends there have given him valuable knowledge for his future endeavors ( such as his memories of Egypt helping him figure out how to defeat the Minions of Set), ending up much more well-adjusted (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and unfortunately for the Daughters, effective</span>) than a lot of other Tyke Bombs. They all even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> show up at Jack's wedding to celebrate and then mourn the loss of his bride alongside him when she ceases to exist as a result fo Aku's defeat in the past.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> When the cartoon series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a></em> was created to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)</a></em>, it needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">explain</a> why Prince Adam/He-Man suddenly had a twin sister (Princess Adora aka She-Ra) no-one had seen or heard of before. So... It seems Adora was kidnapped during infancy by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hordak#She-Ra:_Princess_of_Power">the villain Hordak, who whisked her away to another dimension and raised her himself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> She remains loyal to Hordak well into her adulthood, until an encounter with her brother leads to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SolarOpposites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SolarOpposites">Solar Opposites</a></em>: The Pupa. His purpose is to evolve into a form that will terraform the planet into the image of planet Shlorp using data stored in his DNA by consuming everything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> character Karai is turned into one of these in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">2003 cartoon</a>. An orphan found and adopted by the Shredder at an early age, he turned her into one of his most loyal and capable lieutenants. The Shredder, surprisingly enough, turns out to be a rather good parent (at least from her account) and the ensuing loyalty she feels to him is at the core of her character arc.
</li><li> Slade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> had designs on grooming Robin into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a>. When that failed, he moved on and succeeded with Terra. Then he pushed her too far and suffered an explosive retaliation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>: Ultra Magnus reveals the goal of Project Omega is to create 12 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">super-weapons with reduced intelligence</a> so they would never question that their purpose in life is to destroy or kill. Ratchet is horrified at it, while Ultra Magnus justifies it with the Decepticon threat getting worse (several Con victories had planets destroyed). At the end of the war, only one is still active (one is in stasis, and the another is missing) with all the others dead. In the present Cybertron is thriving and at peace, while Ratchet questions if what they did to achieve that peace was right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>: Project Predacon was meant to create an army of these via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FossilRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FossilRevival">Fossil Revival</a> to serve the Decepticons, but after discovering what the first on they produced was capable of, Megatron decided it was too risky to make any more. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He even goes so far as to lure the Autobots to the lab where the batch in progress is being cloned for the purposes of letting them destroy it. Unfortunately for Megatron, he can't keep this secret from getting out forever, and thus Predaking turns against him at the worst possible moment.</span>
</li><li> X-23, a modified clone of Wolverine, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> (who later became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Canon Immigrant</a> to the print comics)

He has Superman's strength and speed but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">lacks the discipline</a> to use them properly. He has some anger issues that needs to be worked out and the part where his "father" Superman doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">even acknowledge him</a> makes him more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">upset and frustrated</a>. He disrespected Black Canary, believing that he could win any fight based on his power and can be fairly harsh on his teammates. But he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">learning</a>, now respects Black Canary (after she made him swallow his words) and is more friendly with the rest of the Young Justice.
