</p><p>Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">Finagle's Law</a> (or just ignorant writers), on TV a system's failsafe will <em>never</em> work when it's needed the most, nor will it actually be fail<em>safe</em>  usually it'll be quite the opposite, sometimes referred to as "fail deadly". The only reference to an emergency shutdown you'll be likely to hear is a panicked tech yelling "It won't shut down!" as the system runs wild. It's supposed to make the phenomenon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation">Explosive Instrumentation</a> more plausible, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">acknowledging it's not supposed to blow up in your face</a>, but a failure elsewhere of a key safety lockout means it can, and <em>will</em>. It also justifies how something that is supposedly governed by industry-wide standards, regulatory law, and years of engineering refinements could go so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">horribly wrong</a> in the first place.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>What's a failsafe? Well, the world is full of a lot of dangerous machinery and devices. Huge electrical turbines and nuclear reactors, Power lines carrying enough juice to light a whole city and pipelines carrying millions of tons of explosive petroleum or natural gas. Trains speeding down the tracks at 300 km/h, semi trucks that weigh in excess of 40 tons rolling down the freeways, aircraft that weigh more than <em>400</em> tons flying over our heads. And that's just the stuff that <em>isn't</em> designed to kill anyone. There's plenty of stockpiled bombs, missiles and such out there too. These could all cause some spectacular collateral damage if they suddenly went out of control.
</p><p>Thus, in the real world, things that have the potential for very destructive damage not only undergo strict maintenance procedures, but usually have circuit breakers, password protection, arming/firing keys, backups for redundancy, and prominent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">big bright red emergency handles</a> that can shut the whole system down if pulled. More to the point, they usually have a totally separate set of safety features, designed to trigger automatically when the system's operating parameters get too far outside safe norms, which will (ideally) shut down the whole shebang without making the situation worse than it already is.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Contrary to popular understanding, "fail safe" does not mean "safe from failing", i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">"failure-proof"</a>  it means that if (when) it fails, it will do so in a way that leaves it safe. When something is described as "fail safe", it means that it has been designed and built so that a critical mechanical failure or operator mistake will cause the system in question to default to its safest possible state, quickly and automatically, without any human intervention. Consider the following: if you're at an intersection where there's a traffic light, and it fails, if it "fails safe" then either it goes dark or all four directions show a red signal. If it showed green in all four directions, that would be a failure to fail safe. For more info, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/FailsafeFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/FailsafeFailure">the Analysis page</a>. Real Life Failsafe Failures are often caused by an improbable and unanticipated conjunction of two or more failure conditions (one of which will often turn out to have never worked in the first place).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, we see one instance of mechanical failure in the standardized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat">Ejection Seat</a>, and that's presumably because it's being hit with microwaves that short out the electronics (and make the pilot pop like a potato in the microwave). In another episode, when Lelouch's mecha is shot down, the ejection seat has a terrible launch vector and thus ends up skipping along the ground at high speeds; it's a wonder he didn't suffer whiplash.
<ul><li> In one episode this ends up being a good thing as when Guren is defeated by Suzaku and blown off a Britannian aircraft its eject fails, which looks like it might mean Kallen is going to fall to her death, but reinforcements arrive and are able to send her both repair parts and a flight pack that let her save herself and get back into the fight eventually getting past Suzaku to save Lelouch from the crashing ship. If the eject HAD worked on the other hand, Kallen would have been launched to safety but the Guren would have been destroyed and lost and Lelouch would have died because Kallen wouldn't have been able to save him.
</li><li> A perfect aversion in R2 last episode: Gino's mecha is so damaged that it automatically shuts down. We hear Gino begging the engine to move again; actually, he is editing the mecha's low-level settings, removing all safety features so the mecha can at least walk and move its arms.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. Minato and Kushina both implant their chakra in Naruto's seal, so that if he tries to break it they will show up to stop him and repair the seal. This actually works. <em>Both times.</em>
<ul><li> Played straight with both of Itachi's failsafes with regard to Sasuke, though. One was to implant a genjutsu in Sasuke that would cause him to immediately use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Amaterasu</a> upon seeing Tobi's Sharingan, to prevent Tobi from manipulating Sasuke into joining him. Too bad Tobi had kept his most powerful ability secret from Itachi, allowing him to survive the attack. Tobi then invokes the trope.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Tobi</strong>: It's what you'd call a fail-safe... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Although he only got as far as the "fail" part.</a>
</div><ul><li> Itachi's second failsafe was to...somehow...implant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">crow</a> with Shisui Uchiha's left eye into Naruto. He set this one to trigger if Naruto ever saw Itachi's Mangekyo Sharingan again, it would trigger and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwash the possessor of those eyes into unbreakable loyalty to the Leaf Village</a>, under the assumption that Sasuke would take Itachi's eyes and implant them to gain the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. Which did indeed happen, but before that something Itachi could never have expected ruined this failsafe: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi was revived as a zombie and forced to fight Naruto</span>, and thus the perfect brainwashing hit the wrong target. Itachi ultimately decides this was a really bad plan anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> abuses this trope. Every second angel attack, someone has to push <a class="urllink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/molly-guard.html">molly-guarded<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> buttons, smash in the protective glass over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">handle</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutTheJuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutTheJuice">cut the power</a>. Most of the time, the girl at the controls ends up shouting, "The EVA is rejecting the signal!"
<ul><li> The one and only time that the failsafe system does actually work and manages to automatically eject the entry plug, it makes things considerably worse for the pilot. The mechanical systems of Eva apparently have it in for the pilots just as much as everything else.
<ul><li> Granted, this is justified to an extent by the fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Evas are only half-or-so machinery. Their human will seems to be able to screw things over pretty hard</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Another example of it actually working would be in episode 13, when the viral angel attacks Nerv. When one of the Simulation Evas reaches for the Pribnow Box, an emergency shatter-and-pull mechanism blows the arm off, protecting the crew in the Box. The makers probably only allowed that because dying that way is not painful enough in Hideaki Anno's twisted, twisted imagination.
<ul><li> Protecting the crew? It fired the severed arm straight into the glass viewing window which started to crack and leak... forcing the team to abandon the situation AND room before they were drowned in plague infected water.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline">Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online</a></em>: After the original Sword Art Online incident where the NerveGear headsets were used to kill players, the AmuSphere was invented, which is filled with safeties to prevent such a thing from ever happening again. Several players are therefore confused when Pito passes out while playing GGO; the AmuSphere should have automatically logged her out long before she got to that point. They then realize <em>she's still using NerveGear</em>. This demonstrates one of the biggest security headaches: Human error. Luckily for Pito, most of the really big flaws of NerveGear have to be actively taken advantage of by an outside party, and no one is interested in trying any more.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, Dr. Jon Osterman is trapped inside the Intrinsic Field test chamber by the door closing behind him when the automatic timer starts up the generators for that afternoon's experiment. As Dr. Glass puts it, "I'm sorry, Osterman. The program's locked in and we can't over-ride the time lock. It's... it's a safety feature." His last words indicate how horribly aware he is that this trope has come into play.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>
<ul><li> The rings actually do have several failsafes which kick in, shutting down if the wearer breaks Lantern Code, reserving a small supply of energy the lantern normally can't access to protect the wearer from mortal energy and so forth. But Lanterns have been able to override the latter failsafe to continue fighting after their normal reserve is depleted (and given that lanterns are selected for fearlessness, it seems silly to allow that.) Also Hal Jordan was able to override the former failsafe after his ring was depleted for insubordination by drawing energy from a Guardian's construct.
</li><li> The Alpha Lanterns seemed to lack sufficient failsafes. While their minds were linked to the Book of Oa to make sure they faithfully executed their duties as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Internal Affairs</a>, there was no failsafe in place to stop them from being hijacked by Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, whose Kryptonian-based technology has traditionally been billions of years behind the Guardians. Possibly justified by Cyborg's machine empathy.
</li></ul></li><li> Two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> examples, involving the same robot:
<ul><li> In the aftermath of the <em>Acts of Vengeance</em>, the defeated Loki tried to get revenge by destroying New York by stealing control of three Sentinels built by Sebastian Shaw, and combining them into the titanic Tri-Sentinel, which he then ordered to destroy a nuclear power plant. As Spider-Man (who possessed the Captain Universe power) struggled to stop the thing, Shaw tried to activate a failsafe he had placed in the three Sentinels in the event they turned on him (As Sentinels often do.) Simply put, the program would reveal to a Sentinel that, since their abilities were "inherited" and improved upon from the original Mach-1 Sentinels, they are technically mutants. In theory, this would act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a>, causing a rogue Sentinel who has this revelation thrust upon it to destroy itself, as its directive is to destroy mutants. Unfortunately, Loki's sabotage had seriously screwed up the Tri-Sentinel's programming, and the failsafe didn't do anything more than confuse it for a couple of minutes. Still, that small delay was enough for Spidey to bring the Uni-Power to its full potential and blow it to dust in a climactic finish.
</li><li> The Tri-Sentinel appeared again later, this time in the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist">Life Foundation president Carlton Drake</a> who thought he could use the Tri-Sentinel as security for his latest "luxury escape condo". Knowing that Sentinels could regenerate, he had his men gather its remains, and when it was almost whole, he installed what he thought was a better failsafe: a chunk of the incredibly rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Antarctic vibranium</a> (a substance that melts metal) placed it in a special container that nullified the melting effect, and put the container near the robot's brain, thinking he could simply deactivate the container if the robot turned on him. As you might expect, when he activated the creature and ordered it to crush Spider-Man, ignoring the hero's pleas, it quickly deleted the programming he had installed and resumed the mission Loki had given it, and when the panicked Drake tried to activate the failsafe, he found that it had installed a failsafe of its own, preventing him from deactivating the container remotely. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (Because fighting it the way he did before was out of the question, Spidey made his way inside the creature, fought his way past internal defenses, up to its head, and deactivated the container <em>manually</em>. What happened next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">was ironic</a>; the Tri-Sentinel clearly didn't even have anything close to a failsafe for dealing with the Antarctic vibranium as it started to melt its brain, because, as Spidey put it, "Nothing like this has ever happened to a Sentinel before." It tried to expend power to regenerate itself, but the vibranium kept melting it, forcing the Sentinel to expend more and more power, until it was literally vaporized.)</span>

<ul><li> One engineer was so annoyed by the persistent number of Failsafe Failures in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> that he <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Tech/Brahms/index.html">wrote a fanfic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a leading engineer in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe being put on trial for negligence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BaitAndSwitchSTO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BaitAndSwitchSTO">Bait and Switch</a></em>. The USS <em>Bajor</em> is a late-model <em>Galaxy</em>-class with an experimental warp core that operates using minimal fuel in the chamber, meaning there's no need for dilithium to moderate the reaction and a shutdown consists of merely turning off the fuel. Also, as specified in the <em>TNG Technical Manual</em> that the various shows' writing teams apparently never read, its core ejection mechanism operates on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch">Dead Man's Switch</a> principle and is actually an <em>anti</em>-ejection mechanism<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07swm');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07swm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07swm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The core is held in place by electromagnets at the top. Ejection consists of letting the power fail, whereupon the core simply drops out the bottom of the ship with the artificial gravity.</span> Worth noting, the author is a troper and has read the above fanfic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MakeAWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MakeAWish">Make a Wish</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">Portkeys</a> are made with a variety of safety features that prevent users from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleporterAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleporterAccident">apparating in mid-air</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">inside a space too crowded or too small to contain them</a>. The Death Eaters made the mistake of getting Portkeys from a wizard that doesn't like them, and is in fact giving them unsafe portkeys with the intention of getting them killed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Marionettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Marionettes">Marionettes</a></em>, it turns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this trope is why Trixie (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal">discovers she's an android</a>) escaped the Stallions in Black who were chasing her's control: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Alicorn Amulet</a> messing with her head fried her failsafes and freed her. Twilight later invokes this trope to free Lightning Dust the same way.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMaretian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMaretian">The Maretian</a></em>, in addition to Mark's communication problem, there's the cascading failure and shattering of all mana batteries aboard the <em>Amicitas</em>: There were failsafes in place to trigger an emergency shutdown, but they too were designed on Equestria, and thus dependent on the pony universe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField">Background Magic Field</a>.

When Luna was creating a second Tantabus to help her manage dreams, she made sure that it could never leave dreams and enter the real world—but if it <em>did</em> somehow end up in the real world, it would be completely incapable of so much as moving a single blade of grass. The Tantabus grew intelligent, friendly, and helpful, and Luna completely forgot about the failsafe. So when it ends up in the real world by accident, it freaks out because it is incapable of affecting the world in <em>any</em> way. Thankfully Twilight is able to fix things before it <em>dies</em> because it doesn't have access to any of the dream energy that it needs to live.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> galaxy, as a rule, if you destroy a single control console for some piece of technology, that technology will immediately and completely fail. This can range from door/bridge controls (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>) to the absolutely crucial deflector shields protecting a mining outpost on a volcanic planet (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, the 19 kilometer-long Super Star Destroyer <em>Executor</em> goes into an instant nosedive when its main bridge gets destroyed by a rebel fighter, with the thousands of crew members scattered throughout the ship apparently unable to do anything to prevent it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em> has a pretty much identical plot to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FailSafe">Fail Safe</a></em> (see Literature below), but the attack is a result of human intervention rather than mechanical failure (although it is a mechanical failure that prevents one of the bombers from being recalled).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em>, the spaceship's self-destruct fail-safe mechanism is virtually impossible to initiate by accident, but it is just as fiendishly obtrusive to abort it. There is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">no quick reset button</a>. It will not override without first manually disengaging safety interlocks and inserting the rods back in. If a last-minute-decision was ever made to abort, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball">you're basically screwed</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em>, the Auriga is programmed to automatically return to Earth in case something goes wrong. Unfortunately, the Auriga is the site of an alien breeding and testing facility, which is the absolute <strong>last</strong> thing you want near an inhabited planet.
</li></ul></li><li> This is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em> when, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton">Big Red Button</a> is pushed activating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self-destruct</a>, the computer says in the last few seconds that they can stop it by pressing a button to cancel. The button, of course, has a big "out of order" sign hanging on it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dark Helmet:</strong> Out of order!? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">FUCK</a>! Even in the future, nothing works!
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard">Live Free or Die Hard</a></em> the bad guys blow up an entire natural gas facility by routing all the gas to it. There would actually be dozens of failsafes to prevent the necessary overpressure from breaking anything at all, much less exploding. Of course the bad guys used the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacking</a> to pull it off, since computers are magical and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">none of the failsafes are purely mechanical</a>, either.
</li><li> A textbook example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMachinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMachinist">The Machinist</a></em>: a worker is repairing a broken machine when someone accidentally leans on the On button (which is only possible because the workshop has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">No OSHA Compliance</a> <em>whatsoever</em>). Hammering on the Off button does absolutely nothing, the repair worker is dragged into the machine and loses his arm. It's not clear what was wrong with the machine to start with, but it might have been a good idea for someone to <em>disconnect the power</em> before sticking his arm in there. It was made clear that the machine was <em>supposed</em> to be locked out, but the manager had previously reprimanded employees for taking too much time to get equipment fixed. That kind of pressure is definitely illegal, but happens more often than you'd like to think (especially in small shops with narrow profit margins). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The reveal that the main character is insane and frequently hallucinating might explain it, however.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed">Speed</a></em>:
<ul><li> The end involves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayTrain">Runaway Train</a> with the emergency brake disabled, and no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch">Dead Man's Switch</a>. And it didn't trip any overspeed controls either.
</li><li> Then there's the elevator at the beginning. Payne destroys the emergency brakes with bombs, then it turns out the crane Jack and Harry hooked to the car to secure it couldn't hold the weight either.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapricornOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapricornOne">Capricorn One</a></em>, a government agency specifically defeats every failsafe on Robert Caulfield's car. Not only do the brakes fail, the throttle gets stuck wide open, the gearshift is locked so he can't go into neutral, and even turning the key off won't cut the ignition.
</li><li> In the notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IrwinAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IrwinAllen">Irwin Allen</a> disaster flop <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSwarm">The Swarm</a></em> (1978) the killer bees attack a nuclear power station, and cause it to blow up almost instantly when one of the technicians falls across a random instrument panel. Also the actual core is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics">completely exposed to the air without any evident shielding</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em>, an assassin tries to kill Bond by turning up the setting on a spine-stretching exercise machine he's strapped into. Bond blacks out and is only saved by a nurse happening to enter the room just in time. Leaving viewers to wonder why the hell the machine was even designed to be able to go that fast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker">Moonraker</a></em> a mook tries to kill Bond by disabling the chicken switch on a centrifuge and cranking the spin rate to unsafe levels. Not so much Failsafe Failure as intentional tampering, but why would a piece of equipment designed to test human endurance have the wires to the safety switch connected to a plug easily removable by the controller, and why would it go up to speeds considered dangerously unsafe for humans in the first place?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland">The Island</a></em> has two notable examples of this. A truck carrying a massive load of train wheels loses its entire load when a single strap is released, then at the climax throwing a single breaker switch causes the entire mechanism to explosively fail. But then being a Michael Bay film, having things blow up is to be expected.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTakingOfPelhamOneTwoThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTakingOfPelhamOneTwoThree">The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</a></em> where the safety devices on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkSubway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkSubway">New York Subway</a> train are actually a plot point. The police believe the Dead Man's Handle will prevent the villains jumping off the train while it's moving, but they've actually rigged up a system to hold down the lever. Later as the train appears to be careening out of control, it's eventually stopped by the safety devices built into the track.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Outbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Outbreak">Outbreak</a></em>, a lab technician is infected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a> when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">carelessly opens and reaches into a centrifuge</a> while it's still spinning, breaking a vial of infected blood and cutting his hand. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, lids on most (but not all) centrifuges lock until the spinning has completely stopped; for these models, it's <em>impossible</em> to open one while it's still in motion.
<ul><li> In another example, a lab worker is infected when his suit tears (in the novelization, he's infected when his oxygen tube gets pulled from the suit's valve). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, such hazmat suits are generally kevlar-lined and require great trauma in order to be breached, while the valve the oxygen tub connects to is one way and requires said tube to be connected in order to let anything in.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAndromedaStrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAndromedaStrain">The Andromeda Strain</a></em>, the lab has a nuclear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self-destruct device</a>, with three substations (to disarm the bomb) per floor, but it's discovered they need five per floor, and are in the process of adding them, but they haven't been finished (this is a government installation, of course). When the self-destruct countdown is activated, team leader Stone, along with the only team member who has the shut-off key, are trapped in a section with an unfinished nuclear destruct shut-off substation. Stone cries out, "When the bomb goes off, there'll be a thousand mutations! [The virus] Andromeda will spread everywhere, they'll never be rid of it!" He touches the other team member and points at the exposed, unfinished shut-off substation. "The defense system is perfect, Mark, it'll even bury our mistakes."
</li><li> For something less high-tech, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>'s 1993 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a></em> starts with Gabe (Stallone's character) climbing up a mountain to rescue friends Hal and Sarah. To get to the rescue helicopter they have to pull themselves on a line stretched across a chasm, suspended by their climbing harness and a carabiner (a big metal clip). When Sarah is in the middle of crossing, the carabiner starts to buckle; Gabe goes on the line to catch her, but he is too late and she falls to her death. The problem with that scene is that a carabiner is <em>designed</em> to withstand the weight of a falling climber. A standard one would have a rated strength of 23 kilonewtons, while the static load of a of a Hollywood starlet would would be around 0.5 kilonewton. At that point, viewers who knew their climbing may feel their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> shatter with the carabiner. The studio was actually sued by the carabiner manufacturer as a result of this scene and the inaccuracy of it breaking in such a scenario; when it snaps there is a close up of the carabiner with the manufacturer's logo prominently displayed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> begins with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Kilrathi</a> attacking an outpost in order to capture its navigational data. Realizing why the enemy is attacking, the commander of the outpost orders the navcom, which is located in a sealed room, destroyed. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">Self-Destruct Mechanism</a> refuses to work, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to sabotage</span>.
</li><li> This sort of thing seems to happen all the damn time in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> franchise, to the point that it's a wonder that horrific freak accidents don't happen constantly. Some of these failures, though apparently outlandish, are still within the realm of possibility, however unlikely. This is largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as being the work of an unseen force, be it Death or Fate, deliberately tampering with the machinery to lethal effect in order to "balance the books" whenever someone survives a disaster they were never meant to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Passengers2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Passengers2016">Passengers</a></em> it's frequently mentioned that the hibernation pods cannot fail because they have "too many failsafes". The pods actually have a pretty good failsafe in that when they break, the person inside is awakened safely, instead of dying. Unfortunately, that's not too helpful when it happens 30 years into a 120 year voyage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in quick succession in the climactic scene of the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">The Aversion</a>: To 'sell' the appearance of having destroyed the submarine <em>Red October</em> to its recently-evacuated crew, the US Navy attack it with an air-dropped torpedo. The torpedo is successfully aborted before impact in the scene which became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasNeverHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasNeverHere">I Was Never Here</a>.
</li><li> Though it should be noted that with an air-dropped torpedo there is no way to remotely destroy it, it runs until it hits something or runs out of fuel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">The Sub Version</a>: The commandeering of the Red October is interrupted by the arrival of a Russian Alfa-class attack sub, which launches a torpedo. Captain Ramius orders the sub steered into the torpedo's path at full throttle, closing the distance before the torpedo's warhead can arm itself - its safety features work a little <em>too</em> well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">The Justified Version</a>: In response to this failed attack, the commander of the Alfa orders all safety features disabled on his remaining torpedoes. As a result, after playing tag with the next torpedo he fires, the commander of <em>Red October</em> is able to decoy it into locking onto the vessel that fired it, destroying the Alfa.
</li></ul></li><li> The B-movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Evolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Evolver">Evolver</a></em> involves a failed military robot (which ended up killing dozens of soldiers during a training exercise) being re-purposed as a household laser-tag toy. Needless to say, the robot reverts to its original programming and starts killing people. When its creator attempts to use the verbal shutdown code that worked during the training exercise, the robot simply rejects the override and kills the guy.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarGames">WarGames</a></em>.

The General asks why they can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutTheJuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutTheJuice">Cut the Juice</a> to the hacked nuke-controlling master computer. The computer tech explains that if the slave computers in the missile silos don't receive a signal from the master, they will assume that the master computer and NORAD are destroyed, and spin up and launch <em>everything</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>, Owen and two other park employees try to escape the <em>Indominus rex's</em> exhibit. There is a door panel on the inside, allowing them to open the exit. While one worker gets out, the control room has to try and shut the door after that because the <em>I. rex</em> is too close behind Owen. The door closes <em>very slowly</em> allowing both Owen out and the dinosaur to stop it from closing all the way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekBeyond">Star Trek Beyond</a></em>, the air processing system on starbase Yorktown has all kinds of elaborate safeguards to prevent anyone from tampering with it via the computer network. But a person can simply take an elevator to the roof of the building it's on and release a bio-weapon with ease even as people in the command center struggle to overcome those very security protocols to try to stop them.

<ul><li> Obviously <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FailSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FailSafe">Fail Safe</a></em> (the book, movie and TV drama) qualifies. The American strategic nuclear forces have a system in place to prevent bombers from attacking the Soviet Union without clear authorization - bomber crews are conditioned to turn back at the fail-safe line <em>no matter what is happening around them</em>, if they haven't received the go signal themselves. In this case it's an "active go" system, designed to send out an attack order - and it does so incorrectly, due to a subtle and unnoticed technical fault.
</li><li> Norman Moss, in the book "Men Who Play God", makes it clear that this is not how Real Life works - the "go" signal is a voice order that must be given by a human being and cannot be transmitted accidentally. Nevertheless it remains a cautionary tale against the dangers of too much automation in military systems, a thing the American President and Nikita Krushchev are left bemoaning to each other near the end of the book, as the last bomber closes unstoppably on Moscow...

<ul><li> Subverted: it is explained that a set of special bulletproof windows are not designed to be shot at <em>from inside</em>. They can also be jimmied open with just a credit card. This is because of 'The Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SRDT 3454'. The main cause of the riots was a building environment control system. Part of the installation process involved sealing the windows shut, to make it easier for the system to do its work. One particularly hot day, many of these systems broke down, resulting in the overheated office workers taking to the streets. As a result of the riots, buildings were required to have windows that opened.
</li><li> In the same book, it's mentioned that the difference between something that might go wrong and something that "cannot possibly go wrong" is that when something that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong, it's usually impossible to fix.

</li><li> In both the book and the movie of <em>The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3</em>, the criminals hijack a subway train, and demand that all of the signals all the way to South Ferry be set to green. The train then rolls through every signal and station, at speeds exceeding 80 miles per hour. Note that the train does stop when it gets to South Ferry as it is going too fast for the turn and trips the overspeed control. However it's interesting that it never tripped any overspeed control along the way.
</li><li> In the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> (the Stephen King book), lead character Jack Torrance desperately tries to cool down the main boiler of the Overlook Hotel, while Danny, Wendy and Mr. Hallorann escape on a snowmobile. At first, it looks as though the boiler (which has to be constantly maintained) will return to acceptable levels, but the pressure is already too great, and the boiler blows up, taking Jack, the hotel and the topiary animals with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in this case as the boiler is explicitly described as both very old and very dangerous; the hotel manager has been bribing the safety inspector for <em>years</em> to keep it from being forcibly replaced.

Occasionally though, Weber falls into this trope, such as when one of the circuit breakers protecting a fusion plant from power surges is itself knocked out, destroying the ship. Such failures are generally the result of combat damage or sabotage, as the engineers <em>know</em> that if the failsafes on certain systems (Notably the reactors and the inertial compensators) break down, they'll all be dead before they can try to fix it, so they make certain that critical systems are in good repair at all times to prevent spectacular accidents.

Reactor #4 was already experiencing a runaway reaction (caused by human error), and the power spike was just enough to break the control rods, preventing them from cooling the reactor, and ultimately causing the explosion and full meltdown. Now, the Soviet authorities knew RMBK reactors had this flaw, but covered it up so as to save face. This one lie meant that nobody who worked at the plant knew that the AZ-5 would be worse than useless in their situation, and it's speculated that Dyatlov (the guy in charge at the time) pushed the reactor beyond its limits because he thought he had a failsafe, not a detonator.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDwarf">novelisations</a> have the accident unfold slightly differently, and notably it <em>isn't</em> Rimmer's fault.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0q51i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0q51i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0q51i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Presumably the rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> novel continuity would have made it hard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> Rimmer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">personality disk</a> not getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">Thrown Out the Airlock</a> by Lister when he found out.</span> Three important warning lights fail to activate, and when several more come on later the engineering watch-stander <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing">blames them on the coffee he just spilled all over his keyboard</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's <em>incredibly</em> common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, as well as its sister series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>.
<ul><li> The page quote comes from the season 8 episode "Avatar", in which Teal'c is trapped in a virtual reality training simulation, and the failsafe to deactivate the simulation just resets it instead.
</li><li> The Stargate system itself has plenty of failsafes, however, as presumably it was designed to be used by other races, without such devil-may-care attitudes about personal safety. Unfortunately for the SGC, they're operating their Stargate without the standard control device, and feel free to completely disregard any warning signals from the Stargate itself.
</li><li> There <em>is</em> a safety to prevent the gate from closing when something is halfway through - on one occasion, Jack holds a gate open (to prevent the villains from dialing another location and escaping) by not withdrawing his arm from the event horizon after he arrives. The only time there is a threat of something getting cut in half is when the gate hits the 38 minute time limit, which no failsafe could possibly prevent, since except under special circumstances it's physically <em>impossible</em> to keep a wormhole open longer than that.
</li><li> Also commonly inverted in <em>Stargate Atlantis</em>, where Atlantis often activates failsafes during bad situations. It inevitable does exactly the wrong thing for the given situation, forcing McKay to waste precious time overriding the failsafe or killing someone when he fails to.
</li><li> The Pegasus Galaxy also has Spacegates, and there's no way to tell whether you dialed an address for a gate on the ground or a gate in orbit besides stepping through (or checking the Ancient database, but not every civilization has that option). The Pegasus network was designed for Lantean spaceships, but if a failsafe was ever needed in their designs, it's here. It was established a few other points in canon that there's a whole lot of "error codes" that the gate sends back to the DHD, and it's set up to not allow things like water rushing through from an underwater environment (while still allowing solids). Since the system isn't completely understood by anyone, it's possible there's a "Are you really sure you want to step through into space" warning light.
</li><li> Failsafes built into the Stargate network, as well as other Atlantean systems, have been mucked around and hacked so much by the Atlantis expedition (in order for Earth PCs and computers to interoperate) that they might as well not exist. Consider "Avenger 2.0" where Felger's code is none too secure, or where McKay's software updates "broke the Gate". Of course, it wasn't really broken, but nevertheless, there were glitches because of this (hence Sheppard's 40,000 year trip into the future and then some).
</li><li> Also, the Ancients aren't big fans of failsafes. Ancient devices need to have a function as complex as time travel before someone will even consider putting in a failsafe. The failsafe that prevents <em>Atlantis</em> from being crushed underwater after it has run out of energy wasn't even included until someone traveled to the past from a future where the city and its occupants were flooded, for instance... Quite natural because the Lanteans probably didn't forsee that they would submerge the city on the bottom of an ocean and then leave it unattended for 10,000 years.
</li><li> Atlantis itself is the mother of all failsafe failures, a spaceship without an airtight interior. If the shield fails in space, everyone dies, as the crew unpleasantly discovers when they run into power problems while moving it to another planet.
</li><li> The fact that you can remove the safeties on a ZPM is a biggie, you'd have thought that those things would have built-in safeties.
</li><li> The <em>Destiny</em>'s emergency atmosphere-retention forcefields are only strong enough to reduce the flow of air through gaping holes in the hull, not stop it. It's possible that they used to be stronger but are now past their best-by date. They also may not have been designed to compensate for such extensive deterioration.
</li><li> One jammed-open airlock door is apparently enough to drain the air from all of the remaining habitable areas of the ship, with no other doors capable of being sealed to further compartmentalize the area. Granted, the ship has already had a lot of sections sealed off for this very reason, so perhaps this is simply the case failsafes can be driven past their limits by repeated failure. But one would think that having an airlock and the Stargate in the same emergency-seal compartment would be a bad idea.
</li><li> In a case where a <em>working</em> failsafe caused problems, the shuttle docked at said airlock wouldn't close its own airlock door without someone inside it to operate the controls. This probably prevents you from locking yourself out, but in this case meant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> was needed to stop the shuttle from leaking all of Destiny's air.
</li><li> <em>Destiny</em>'s atmosphere recyclers packed it in over the millennia and the ship automatically stopped off at a planet where needed chemicals could be found to repair it. But the ship's autopilot was still set to take the ship back to hyperspace after a fixed period of time, whether or not the chemicals had been recovered by then.
</li><li> This trope is part of the show's stock in trade. Most of the drama is derived from either yet another of Destiny's millenia-old unmaintained systems failing catastrophically, or the failsafes <em>working</em>, but none of the human crew knowing what the failsafe procedure actually is, and everyone panicking. When the proper operating procedures include <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">diving into a sun to refuel</span>, the panic is understandable.
</li><li> Averted in one case with an electrified corridor. There's a handy manual breaker just to make sure you can kill the power. However, the fact that a corridor can, without warning, turn into an electrified deathtrap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">invokes another trope</a>.
</li><li> It gets better, the ship's capable of <em>getting into your head</em>. In "Trial and Error" when <em>Destiny</em> sensed Young was going through a mental breakdown, it initiated a program that caused Young to continually have vivid dreams and hallucinations of the ship being destroyed, evaluating if he had the ability to continue commanding the vessel. Let that sink in... the ship saw someone suffering a mental breakdown and felt the best solution was to do something that <em>nearly drove him insane</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, where fail-safes are almost never shown or mentioned unless they fail. One fan group came up with the name "SINEW" for this phenomenon: "Somehow it never, ever works."
<ul><li> The warp core is chronically incapable of being shut down in case of emergency. This gets to the point where, in the later series, systems are built into ships to <em>eject the core</em> from the ship when it's about to explode. These also always fail. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> says they would have to first cut off the antimatter fuel input to safely eject the core, which should mean the reactor <em>shuts down and doesn't need ejecting</em> anymore... but apparently the only time the writers remember the ship even has fuel is when they do a running-out-of-fuel episode. The tendency for the antimatter core to suddenly end up in a runaway overload situation is indicative of the core constantly being at a dangerously high power level. Compare this to modern nuclear reactors, where it's kept at JUST high enough of a level to keep things running while being easy to shut down (as well as self-stopping) in the event of a crisis.
</li><li> The classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction">Holodeck Malfunction</a> requires <em>four</em> conditions that you'd think would be unlikely to all happen at once: the exit door, the off-switch, and the safety protocols must fail, and <em>everything else must continue to work perfectly.</em> Apparently, this happens almost <em>every time the holodeck is used on-screen.</em> There is no easy way to turn it off even from the outside, as for some inexplicable reason the holodeck is <em>the only system on a starfleet ship</em> to have an independent power supply, and they can't shut it down any better than the warp core. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">And why is the holodeck designed to accurately simulate dangerous things like bullets and mustard gas anyway?</a>
</li><li> For some unknown reason, a <em>lieutenant</em>, albeit the Chief Engineer, has sufficiently high administrator privileges on the <em>Enterprise-D's</em> computer that he can not only accidentally lock himself out of the system, but also everybody else all the way up to the <em>captain</em>! Even worse, this also allowed an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction">accidentally-created sentient hologram</a> being generated by the computer itself to gain those same absolute administrator privileges! (TNG: "Elementary, Dear Data")
</li><li> Data is able to seize absolute control of the ship's computer by virtue of the fact that, having sophisticated speech capabilities, he can precisely mimic Picard's vocal patterns and fool the voice biometrics authentication that the computer uses. This is in spite of the fact that the computer tracks the location of all members of the crew in real time, and thus must be aware that Picard is not on the bridge even though he's supposedly issuing orders from that location. A simple retinal or facial recognition scan would have foiled or at least seriously hindered Data's efforts. It's really unsettling just how easily one android hijacks the entire Enterprise, and none of the security holes this reveals are ever mentioned or shown to be fixed. (TNG: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E3Brothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E3Brothers">Brothers</a>")
</li><li> Particularly ridiculous is the season one finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, where the "manual" override on a door lock is shut down by a power failure, negating the very purpose of a manual override in the first place. As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a></em> put it, "That's like having an emergency light that plugs into a wall socket, or a parachute with a rope attached back to the airplane."
</li><li> In the episode "Unexpected" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, the handrail on the lift in engineering is capable of severing limbs, as there is no cut off if there's resistance. The only person who views this as a problem is supposedly irrationally anxious due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseinContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseinContext">pregnancy</a>. The person he's talking to questions why anyone would put their hand on the <em>handrail.</em>
</li><li> The brigs on Starfleet ships default to open in case of power failure. Even if they need the force field to prevent "jail break" via transporter, there's no reason they couldn't <em>also</em> have a thick steel door (not getting into the many natural minerals that have stopped transporters). There isn't even a backup power supply. The same applies to the medical quarantine in sickbay, and to the force fields that are frequently placed around hazardous life-forms and other suspicious specimens. This is not to mention the fact that force fields are also used to seal hull breaches in combat, meaning that in the event of power loss, which is likely to occur if one's shields are down, the ship is open to space.

Before the bombs fell, the Sierra Madre was set up to broadcast a distress signal on its external radio antennas if something catastrophic happened. Unfortunately, since all the radios were set to broadcast music for the Grand Opening until after it was finished (three guesses as to what happened before the Grand Opening), the 'emergency' broadcast is still a broadcast inviting people to the Grand Opening Gala Event at the casino proper. Since the broadcast was designed to repeat until help arrived, this has led hundreds of unwary explorers to their deaths over the years...

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">The sinking</a> of the <em>Titanic</em> on 15 April 1912 was so unexpected because of its novel failsafe design, with multiple watertight compartments that should have been able to keep it afloat even if one compartment was breached (of course, multiple compartments were breached in the collision). The bulkheads that were supposed to seal off the compartments, while extending above the waterline, were not sealed at the top, meaning that they could still overflow and fill other compartments, something of a design flaw. And of course, the final failsafe on any ship—the lifeboats—failed to save most of the passengers, because there weren't enough of them. The <em>Titanic</em> had room to carry enough lifeboats, but it sailed with only one-third of its capacity. Contrary to urban legend, this wasn't because the builders thought the ship was unsinkable and dodged regulations. Carrying only a fraction of lifeboat capacity was standard practice at the time, based on assumptions about how slowly passenger ships sank—it was expected that help would arrive before the ship had to be completely evacuated and the lifeboats would simply ferry the passengers to the rescue vessels. The only ships that sailed with enough lifeboats for everybody were warships, which were expected to go down in conditions where they would sink <em>fast</em>. There <em>were</em> regulations on the bare-minimum number of lifeboats to be carried, but they were based around the weight of the ship, not passenger capacity, and the number aboard <em>Titanic</em> as-built was already <em>over</em> that limit. The <em>Titanic</em> just had the poor luck to sink in a situation where the closest ship (The <em>Californian</em>) couldn't receive her distress calls due to the lack of round-the-clock wireless operations, and the second closest (The <em>Carpathia</em>) was too far away to reach the <em>Titanic</em> before it sank.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl Nuclear</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#The_accident">Power Plant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had all the normal failsafes for its reactor design but operators had deliberately disabled many of them to test a new shutdown procedure.
<ul><li> Worse, the operators were trying to increase output because the test wasn't working as anticipated. Even worse than that, the shutdown had been scheduled much earlier in the day but minor problems on the grid delayed it. Thus, the crew performing the test were not the ones who had been briefed on it. They mistakely reduced power, then overcorrected into a completely untested and unstable reactor mode... then decided to proceed with the test instead of just shutting down.
</li><li> The operator errors were exacerbated by several design features that were clearly less then ideal. For example, the control rods were poorly designed — in an emergency reactor shutdown or "scram", the control rods are dropped en masse to block neutron emissions and shut down the chain reaction. Because Chernobyl's control rods had graphite tips (the same material used to moderate the reaction in the first place), the scram caused a sudden power flare before damping the reaction. The Soviet Union was <em>aware</em> of the potential for power spikes, but previous spikes had always been brought under control and the problem never became a priority to fix. By the time the (unfortunately manually operated) scram button was finally pressed at Chernobyl, partial meltdown had already begun. When all of the graphite rod tips entered the chamber at once, the resulting power spike damaged the reactor vessel. The control rods broke off, leaving the reaction-boosting graphite tips lodged in the chamber and the actual control rods jammed and broken, at which point the reactor exploded. However, many other RBMK-design reactors were successfully operated for many years after the catastrophe, sugggesting that the design issues were not as big a factor in the disaster as human error.
</li></ul></li><li> Britain's experimental Windscale nuclear reactor was simultaneously an example and an aversion of a Failsafe Failure. The reactor was constructed in order to give Britain parity with the United States in the nuclear arms race, but a combination of modifications to the reactor's operating procedures and incomplete understanding of graphite's response to nuclear bombardment resulted in situations where the reactor would periodically give off spikes of high heat, for which the original temperature monitoring equipment was woefully inadequate. It also lulled the operators into getting accustomed to seeing occasional high temperatures in the normal course of operation. Thus, when the reactor caught fire, it was at first thought nothing was wrong. It continued for three days at temperatures exceeding a thousand degrees centigrade whilst the temperature sensors - located away from the hotspots - reported normal operating conditions. The original design allowed for the uranium fuel cores to be pushed through their channels into a cooling bath, but by the time the fire had been discovered the cores were too hot to move. Not only had they become jammed by heat expansion, they were so hot that metal poles used to try and move them simply melted on contact. After several failed attempts to cool the reactor it was eventually brought under control by flooding the cores with water.
<ul><li> However, the disaster could have had far more serious consequences. Windscale was air-cooled. Core temperature was kept under control with a series of fans, and the waste heat was exhausted into the air. On the suggestion of Nobel prize-winning nuclear pioneer Sir John Cockcroft the cooling towers were fitted with expensive, complex air filters, which were originally pooh-poohed on account of the work involved - the towers had already been constructed by the time Cockroft found out about them, and the filters were large, heavy structures that had to be built on top of the towers. As it turned out, the filters prevented the direct release of red-hot nuclear particulates into the environment, although the release of radiation was nonetheless substantial.
</li></ul></li><li> On the Boeing 747's first flight, the backup batteries that would have powered the hydraulics in case of engine failure failed upon takeoff. Doesn't sound like much until you find out that the newly introduced high bypass engines were very finicky and the engineers had little idea whether they would stall upon takeoff due to the change in the angle of attack in the air (these engines stalled very easily - at the time a tailwind could easily lead to a stall). Engine stall = no power = no hydraulics = no control over flight surfaces = guaranteed crash = 700,000lb bomb loaded with jet fuel. Thus, they strapped on some batteries to power said hydraulics, but the batteries failed. Fortunately the first flight went according to plan.

</li><li> The tale of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_glider">The Gimli Glider<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. On July 22, 1983, a combination of underfueling Air Canada's brand new Boeing 767 and a faulty fuel level sensor led to its pilots not knowing they were low on fuel until they ran out - <em>at 41,000 feet in midair</em>. To top it off, many of the instruments in the cockpit were electronic and designed to be powered by the jet's fuel - meaning that <em>the pilots were flying blind and had no ability to control the aircraft</em>. Fortunately for all concerned, there were a few battery-powered backup systems and a nearby decommissioned landing strip (the former Royal Canadian Air Force Station Gimli), and Captain Pearson happened to be an experienced glider pilot. The Gimli Glider managed to land safely (though it blew out a few tires on the landing gear and skidded to a stop on its nose) with no fatalites and only minor injuries. The Gimli Glider was repaired and flew for 25 more years until it was decommissioned in 2008.
<ul><li> This is actually an aversion, as the 767's Ram Air Turbine, basically a small windmill emergency generator, deployed automatically and provided minimal power to the instruments until they finally lost too much airspeed before landing. That said, there were a few issues with the evacuation slides, which would actually be a minor example of this trope (the collapsed nosegear put the entire plane on an angle such that the rear evacuation slides didn't quite reach the ground, leading to some of the aforementioned minor injuries).
</li></ul></li><li> This was an issue that arose with aircraft hydraulic systems in the 1980s. All planes had three separate hydraulic lines, specifically so that if one of them was breached, the other two would prevent a total loss of flight controls. However, this system relied on the plane having at least one intact hydraulic system; designers did not believe it was possible for all three lines to fail, so this appeared to be acceptable. That is, until two crashes in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123">1985<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232">1989<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> proved that the system had a weakness: because all three lines clustered together at the tail, catastrophic damage in that area could, in fact, breach all three hydraulic lines at once. Following the second accident, all aircraft were fitted with an <em>additional</em> backup system to account for what had previously been considered an impossible failure; now if the hydraulic lines are breached, a mechanism seals the line ahead of the breach to prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid.
</li><li> On Aug. 18, 2003, Hitoshi Nikaidoh, a surgical resident at St. Joseph Cristus Hospital in Houston, Texas, was decapitated by an elevator with faulty door failsafes. The car was supposed to be "out of order", but some jerk removed the sign. Did anybody think to cut the elevator's power?
</li><li> Pressurized or liquid gas cylinders are nasty things if not treated nicely. There are <a class="urllink" href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2006/03/08/how_not_to_do_it_liquid_nitrogen_tanks.php">very good reasons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> why cylinders have pressure release valves and rupture disks, and why they shouldn't be diked out. As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> demonstrated, a gas cylinder can punch a nice, clean hole through a cinder block wall (they built one for the test). In the process, the <em>wall was shoved back noticeably</em> and the wall behind said cinder block wall was nearly punched through itself.
</li><li> In the design of the space shuttle <em>Challenger</em>, the joints between booster rockets segments were sealed by two thin rubber o-rings, the second ring intended as a failsafe if the first ring failed to seal. The SRB design itself wasn't flawed; it worked fine — so long as you maintained mission parameters, didn't try to launch on a day below the recommended operating temperature, and didn't reuse parts that were obviously deteriorating. The Morton-Thiokol engineers who designed the SRB knew this and objected to NASA and their own upper management overriding their recommendations. Thanks to near-freezing temperatures at the January 28, 1986 launch, <em>both</em> rings failed to seal and were vaporized. Then there was nothing to stop the rocket's flame from burning away one of the booster's support brackets, the unsecured booster smashing nose-first into the external fuel tank, and the fuel tank rupturing from aerodynamic forces when the insufficiently secured booster smashed its nose into the tank. Also, pressure suits and the cockpit ejector seats had been discarded after the first few missions since crews of seven couldn't be ejected during launch. In the two-deck orbiter design only the pilot and commander could have ejected, and possibly the two crew seated behind. Because they were a deck down, other passengers (in <em>Challenger</em>'s case, including teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe) would have died anyway. By contrast the earlier Apollo and Mercury launchers were both equipped with escape towers — separate rocket systems that pull the crew capsule off of and away from a faulty booster rocket — while the side-by-side Gemini design allowed for ejection. And there have been two different Cosmonaut crews saved from certain death by the escape towers launching their Soyuz capsules away from an exploding rocket.
<ul><li> The O-rings weren't even designed to act as failsafes for the rocket boosters. It was discovered that the stress of ignition tended to bend the joints between two segments of the booster, however the O-rings, heated by the igniting rocket fuel inside, would expand enough to cover the holes. As it seemed to work just fine, the design wasn't changed. However being as the lauch site was in Florida, no one thought to take into account the extreme cold's effect on the rubber o-rings. In fact the Morton-Thiokol engineers specifically told NASA on the morning of the launch that they had no idea how the cold would effect the O-rings (as the launch had already been delayed several times, NASA put pressure on them to give the okay). So in a cascading series of improbable events, the joint bent under the stress of ignition while the O-rings, which had frozen overnight, failed to heat and expand fast enough to seal the gap and were instead vaporized.
</li><li> The Soviet <em>Buran</em> shuttle was launched some two years after the <em>Challenger</em> catastrophe, but included the ejection seats for the whole crew right from the start of the design process. In fact Soviet designers have long (and quite vocally) criticized the Space Shuttle cockpit layout, calling it a throwback to the WWII era bomber cockpits, and made a point of putting all crew seats on the same deck. Had the Shuttle used the same layout, at least several crewmembers could've possibly been saved.
</li></ul></li><li> The crew of Soyuz 11 died from a leaking pressure valve during reentry. During descent, the explosive bolts which attached the service module to the descent module were fired simultaneously instead of sequentially. This damaged the pressure valve which was supposed to equalize pressure inside the module once they entered Earth's atmosphere, causing it to open while the module was still in space. There was a manual override for the valve, but it was located underneath the seats making it almost impossible to find in an emergency. Later a cosmonaut on the ground attempted to close the valve himself and found it took over a minute to do so, while the biometric sensors on one of the cosmonauts showed 40 seconds had elapsed between loss of pressure and death, in reality oxygen deprivation would have disabled the cosmonauts in far less time, approximately 15-20 seconds.
</li><li> Apollo 1 and <em>Liberty Bell 7</em>. The latter case came first.
<ul><li> After Virgil Grissom's Mercury capsule splashed down, the explosive bolts on the hatch (which were there for emergency egress purposes) went off, allowing water to rush into the tiny capsule and sink it. Grissom was very much in danger of drowning, as the crews of the recovery helicopters were trained <em>too</em> well and had to realize the capsule was a lost cause before finally realizing the astronaut was also having difficulty staying afloat and rescuing him. After losing a spacecraft, NASA decided explosive bolts were a bad idea, and did not incorporate them into subsequent designs, instead opting for doors which required much more deliberate effort to open. On the Apollo 1 spacecraft, the door opened inward. They claimed this was safer (And in a fundamental way, it <em>is</em>. Pressure doors are supposed to open in the direction of positive pressure so that this pressure works <em>with</em> the door to keep it closed under normal conditions. That's why airliner doors always open <em>inward</em> while submarine hatches always open <em>outward</em>). While the crew of Apollo 1 was doing a test on the ground, a fire started in the capsule. The atmosphere inside was pure oxygen at greater than sea level pressure (in case you flunked chemistry, pure oxygen cranks any flame in it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>), and NASA had also managed to put all kinds of flammable materials in the cockpit. As the fire rapidly grew, the pressure grew inside the cockpit, making it <em>impossible</em> for any human being to open the inward-opening door, which, due to the lack of explosive bolts, could not be blown open. Smoke and fire turned the cockpit into a fiery tomb from which there was no escape, and all three astronauts died. One of these astronauts was Virgil Grissom.
</li><li> The fact that the cabin was pressurized to about 2 atmospheres, to reflect net outward pressure the capsule would experience in space, was also a major contributory factor. It meant there was both far more oxygen available to accelerate the fire and that an inward opening door was simply physically impossible to open until the oxygen pressure was reduced. Just as there were no emergency bolts, there was also no means for depressurizing in time. There did exist a means for depressurizing rapidly, called the cabin repress valve, there was just no times to use it. According to the <a class="urllink" href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01c_Timeline.htm">Apollo One Fire Timeline<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the crew noticed the fire (by verbal report) at 23:31:04.7. The Command Module ruptured due to pressure at 23:31:19.4, less than 15 seconds later. During the investigation, they determined that had the repress valve been opened, it would have delayed the rupture by about one second. Even if they could have instantly flushed the atmosphere, the interior surfaces had foam padding that was going to be removed prior to an actual launch protecting bulkheads and side panels from being scuffed and dinged during ground testing. After having been soak in 2 atmosphere pure oxygen for 3+ hours, the foam would have burned like napalm in hard vacuum.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar story happened in the Soviet program too, but wasn't really a case of the <em>failsafe</em> failure — only the crew error. The cosmonaut on a week-long test in an oxygen chamber decided to brew himself some tea and turned on a hot plate. As he was scheduled to have some medical tests taken that day, he needed to clean and disinfect the electrodes' attachment points on his skin, which he did with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab, which he then proceeded to unthinkingly throw in the general direction of the garbage bin. Unfortunately the swab landed right onto the hot plate, and in a pure oxygen atmosphere of a chamber combusted immediately, starting a major fire. Due to the design of the chamber door it was opened only some 20 minutes later, when the cosmonaut in question, Valentin Bondarenko, already sustained third degree burns, from which he died a couple days later.
</li><li> The Apollo 13 Failsafe Failure was even more spectacular (the fact that NASA managed to bring the command module home with all three men alive is often considered NASA's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>). It was essentially a whole <em>series</em> of Failsafe Failures.
<ul><li> The faulty oxygen tank on Apollo 13 was previously installed on Apollo 10, but was removed and sent back to the factory because of a design change. It was jarred during removal because someone forgot to remove a screw that was holding it in place, causing it to be pulled up a few inches and dropped by a machine arm. This knocked the drainage tube in the tank (which was also part of the electronic level gauge) out of alignment, which prevented the gauge from properly indicating when the tank was empty. The tank contained an electrical heating coil that could be turned on to heat the oxygen inside for use in flight, and a pair of fans that were used to stir the contents of the tank to get an accurate level reading in ballistic (<em>zero-g</em>) flight. During a test run, because the gauge wasn't working properly, technicians believed the tank wasn't draining so they turned the heater on. There were 2 thermostats on the heater which should have opened and broken the electrical circuit if it got too hot, but the tank circuits were designed to run on 28 volts, provided by the on-board fuel cells during flight. Since this was a ground test, the heater was powered by the ground support equipment which runs at 65 volts. The thermostats were rated for 30 volts maximum, and the too-high voltage welded the contacts shut. There was <em>also</em> a human watching an outside temperature gauge that registered the heat inside the tank, but the gauge was only designed to go up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (which was about 200 degrees hotter than the sub-zero oxygen would be stored in). Since the needle never went above 80, he didn't realize the tank was getting up to 1,000 degrees inside, and as a result the insulation coating the electrical wires inside the tank melted... which left them vulnerable to short-circuit and sparking. Apollo 13 was launched on schedule with the faulty tank, and four days into the flight, they flipped on the stirring fans in the tank, the damaged wiring sparked and ignited the tattered remains of insulation, and fire inside the tank promptly exploded it.
</li><li> To make matters <em>even worse</em>, the Apollo craft carried two oxygen tanks for extra safety, but they shared some plumbing, and when tank #2 exploded, it took several critical parts of tank #1's plumbing with it. Result: the oxygen in <em>both</em> tanks was soon lost, and the astronauts inside would have died in a few hours if they hadn't been carrying a healthy lunar module with its own oxygen supply.
</li><li> At least the nuclear fuel rod cask was fine. A miniature nuclear pile was built to power some instruments that were to be left permanently on the moon, but just in case the mission never got to the moon, a ceramic cask was built to contain the nuclear fuel, and it was designed to survive a fiery reentry to Earth... just in case. And survive it did.
<ul><li> The SNAP-27 carried on Apollo 13 (and Apollos 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17) was a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, essentially an atomic battery, not a reactor (there's no chain reaction fission going on, that's the clue). It basically turns the heat of spontaneous radioactive decay into electricity via thermocouples. It is similar in design to the RTGs carried on Pioneer, Voyager, Cassini, and the New Horizons probes. They've also been used to power lighthouses, Antarctic science experiments, and anywhere you need a decade's reliable power source. It was probably one of the most reliable components flying on Apollo 13. Even if the cask had ruptured during reentry, the plutonium inside would have remained intact and ended up at the bottom of the same 20,000 ft. deep trench, doing absolutely no harm to anyone for the next 5,000 years.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Ariane 5 rocket's maiden flight: The navigation system had two redundant computers to handle hardware failure, but because a software error happened instead, both computers crashed simultaneously. The consequences theatened to break the rocket apart, but were successfully caught by <em>another</em> failsafe... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">the Range Safety system</a>.
</li><li> As shown on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>: plugged safety valve on water heater + thermostat failure = <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">steam-powered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">ballistic missile</a>. As reported all over the news, one such incident occurred in a strip mall in Burien, WA on July 28, 2001.
<ul><li> Part of the start up procedure for an industrial or commercial boiler (a water heater is technically considered a type of boiler) involves getting the pressure (steam) or temperature (water) high enough to make the safety valves lift. If they don't, you shut it down. The things that hold them closed are set to lift automatically at the maximum working pressure/temperature. Broken gauges and sensors can still result in one exploding during startup if the valves (which don't require power) are broken because it won't shut down automatically and the person doing the startup won't know that there is a problem until it is too late.
</li></ul></li><li> The original DC-10 airliner cargo door fault that caused the 1974 Paris disaster. Firstly, the cargo door opened outwards, as opposed to inwards. This meant that air pressure inside the plane would naturally try to force it open, requiring a complex set of locking hinges and pins to keep it closed. Secondly, the door handle was supposed to be impossible to close unless all the pins were safely latched, but in practice, if enough force was applied to the handle, the internal mechanisms would bend out of shape without latching. So, the door could still appear to be closed and locked even when it wasn't. Thirdly, warning placards to inform the ground crew of the potential problem were installed, but they were only in English, which most ground crews around the world couldn't read. And finally, when the door blew out, the pressure change collapsed the cabin floor and severed <em>all</em> of the aircraft's control lines, including the redundant backups, rendering the pilots helpless. Airliners have floor vents to prevent such a catastrophic failure, and the DC-10 <em>DID</em> have them — they simply were too small and the pressure in the cabin and in the cargo compartment didn't equalize fast enough to prevent the floor from collapsing.
<ul><li> And the reason that there were even warning placards in the first place? In 1972 there was a American Airlines flight that had the exact same problem, but that one got a small but significant lucky break: not all of the control lines were severed, so the pilots retained some level of control and managed to land the plane with no loss of life. Because the only way that the FAA could force McDonnell Douglas to fix the planes was to ground them all and not let them fly before the door was repaired, there was a gentlemen's agreement between the head of the FAA and McDonnell Douglas to put in this "failsafe" rather than fix the fundemental issue.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> cars have anti-stall systems in the engine management computer. These are very useful as long as they don't go off accidentally on the starting grid and put the car into neutral when it ideally should be in first. This is more embarrassing than dangerous though.
<ul><li> The system is capable of forcing the car to continue moving when the driver attempts to stop. This caused test driver María de Villota to crash into a stationary truck, suffering serious injuries that may have led to her death 18 months later.
</li></ul></li><li> HMS <em>Ark Royal</em> sank after being hit by a torpedo that, among other things, caused flooding that shut down the boiler which powered the emergency pumps and <em>all</em> the electrical generators, the ship having been built without dedicated emergency generators separate from the main system. Oops. (Poorly engineered and inadequate electrical systems were a "feature" of all Royal Navy ships of the period because their urgent need to rearm arose right when the Great Depression was making R&amp;D funds hard to come by.)
<ul><li> USS <em>Enterprise</em> (the fifth one, CV-6) had a steering engine breakdown in the middle of one of the carrier battles for Guadalcanal, jamming the rudder into a hard turn. Fortunately the crew had rigged an emergency steering engine in case this very thing happened. Unfortunately, everyone in the compartment with the backup was knocked out by toxic gas released from nearby fires. It took nearly thirty minutes for someone to reach the compartment, and before he could turn on the backup motor he passed out as well; fortunately he came to fifteen minutes later and managed to turn on the backup motor. While all this was going on, another Japanese air raid was detected approaching but turned away fifty miles out.
</li><li> The Japanese carriers at Midway had their emergency generators for the firefighting system just off the upper hanger deck, about at the midships line. This placed them on the same deck where any bomb that struck the carrier would probably explode, at about the spot enemy pilots would use as aiming point. At least two of them probably lost the backup generators to shrapnel from exploding bombs.
</li><li> Similarly, the British Navy during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> had one of the safest and most efficient systems of transferring explosives from turrets to magazines. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Admiral David Beatty</a> of the Battle Cruiser Fleet thought that they weren't efficient enough, and so decided not to use them, unlike his superior and commander of the Grand Fleet Admiral Jellicoe. The result? At the Battle of Jutland, both the battlecruisers of the Battle Cruiser Fleet and the dreadnoughts of the Grand Fleet sustained similar hits. But while the dreadnoughts stood up beautifully, firing back and damaging several of their German counterparts so badly that they were effectively forced out the war, three battlecruisers exploded in as many minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inversion</a>: Electrical codes require failsafe protection (fuses or circuit breakers, for example) to be on all circuits, to stop the current flow in the circuit when the wire gets hot enough to possibly catch on fire. Aspiring electricians will have the failsafe rules for preventing electrical fires hammered into their heads repeatedly (electrical fires being as much as if not more of a danger than electrical shock). So it is jarring at first, to learn that circuits for fire pumps MUST NOT have any fuses or circuit breakers of any kind. Why? If the fire pump is running, it is assumed there is already a fire, and a fuse or breaker breaking the circuit (and shutting off the pump) isn't going to improve the situation.
<ul><li> Probably applicable only to the American grids, which have a peculiar system where the neutral wire is isolated from the ground. European grids have the neutral grounded, so short circuits do not usually propagate for a large distance, making this requirement somewhat irrelevant.
<ul><li> One result of this is that some American three-phase electrical outlets have up to <strong>five</strong> electrical contacts, one for each of the three alternating-current phases, one for the un-grounded neutral wire, and one for the ground-wire.
</li></ul></li><li> The grounding wire is a fail safe that's connected usually to the chassis of the object in the event that short circuits dump to it and not across your hand or anything contacting it. However, you can "disable it" by getting a three-prong to two-prong adapter (ironically the two-prong adapter has a tab so you can connect a grounding wire to it... but nobody does anyway).
</li><li> Zinsco brand circuit breakers, installed in countless homes from the 1950s to the 1980s, were infamous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWontTurnOff">spontaneously arc-welding themselves into the "on" position</a>, leading to thermal runaway and structural fire in the event of an overload or short. Federal Pacific Electric breakers were similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">non-UL-compliant</a> and could randomly fail to trip after years of seemingly smooth operation.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the main causes of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident was a pressure relief valve sticking open. At first the dangerous pressure is relieved — and then the coolant keeps escaping through the stuck-open valve.
<ul><li> Which the operators would've noticed, if the indicator light had been connected to the valve itself rather than the switch that controlled the valve.
</li><li> Adding to the problems there, the plant was being operated with several alarm lights permanently locked on due to some type of failure in the system causing the alarms to read false, and instead of fixing the issue, they just ignored them. So when the things which those alarms were supposed to be monitoring actually reached the alarm point... no-one knew.
</li><li> Ironically, the manager on duty at the time of the accident had gone to see a movie the night before... <em>The China Syndrome</em>, which is about safety coverups at a nuclear power plant, complete with a near-meltdown situation.
</li><li> Another problem was the control room was equipped with more than 120 separate dials, alarms, and gauges, making it very difficult to isolate the root cause when the accident triggered virtually all of them at once.
</li></ul></li><li> The SL-1 reactor, site of the only fatality directly caused by a nuclear incident in the US. It was built for and run by the US Army as a prototype for a small, semi-portable reactor to power mobile command centers. A technician was performing a maintenance test on it while it was shut down. Said test required him to manually elevate the reactor's only control rod a few inches. He raised it up almost 2 feet. The reactor became instantly active and went prompt critical<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gs19');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gs19" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gs19');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Despite what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience">Hollywood Science</a> says, a reactor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">Going Critical</a> is <em>not</em> a bad thing. All it means is that the reaction is self-sustaining, i.e., it's turned on. <strong>Prompt</strong> critical, on the other hand, means you're screwed before you even have time to say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>."</span>, the sudden power spike caused the water in the reactor to superheat and flash to steam, and the pressure surge ejected the control rod, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impaled the technician on the roof of the compartment</a>. Luckily the other failsafes that weren't violated/ignored to do this kicked in and shut down the reactor, but not before the other two people at the site were killed by the explosion - while also receiving enough radiation to require all three to be buried in lead-lined coffins entombed in cement.
</li><li> The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico occurred because the blowout preventer, a supposedly idiot-proof device that seals the pipe in the event of something like, say, a rig explosion, failed. It turns out that the device had been tampered with (one of the rams that would have sealed the pipe was taken out to make room for some kind of monitoring equipment, amongst other things) but it's still a great example.
<ul><li> It gets better. That was the <em>backup</em> device. Someone noticed a problem with the primary during some tests, hence Transocean fitted the monitoring kit and said "Oh, don't worry, the backup will take care of it." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw">Predictably</a>, when it was called upon, the backup failed.
<ul><li> It <em>still</em> gets even better - there has been a rumor that the alarm was turned off so false alarms wouldn't wake people up. No wonder 11 people died.
</li></ul></li><li> BP's safety record is one of the worst in that regard, in that disabling the failsafes and monitors to increase productivity seems to be SOP for the company. For example, the earlier Texas City Refinery Explosion occurred partly because someone disabled an overflow alarm, which, when the other one broke, started a chain reaction that killed 17 people.
<ul><li> TransOcean has an even worse safety record, actually citing the year of the spill as their <em>best year ever</em> and their least number of accidents.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Big_Bayou_Canot_train_wreck">Big Bayou Canot train wreck of 1993<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happened because a barge struck a railroad bridge hard enough to distort and displace the tracks, but not hard enough to actually break them, which would have set off warning signals and stopped the train.
</li><li> Cancer is an example of a failsafe failure of a failsafe failure of a failsafe failure of a failsafe failure. Precancerous cells are a normal occurrence in the human body due to imperfections in DNA replication. Fortunately human cells have proliferation control mechanisms, though failures in these systems can cause inappropriate cell division. On top of this, cells have other control mechanisms such as cell contact signals that stop cell division, cell survival signals, immuno-detection of cancerous cells, telomeres limiting the number of cell replications. These other failsafes are overcome by natural selection and the law of large numbers though, further compounding mutations during DNA replication in subsequent generations of the cell line.
</li><li> Alzheimer's, meanwhile, is to some extent a problem because the failsafe works too well: the brain is equipped with so many tiers of redundancies and backups that it can suffer a huge amount of neural degradation before the person's everyday performance is noticeably affected - but this means that by the time the symptoms are obvious, it's because everything that can be done already <em>has</em> been and the battle is mostly lost. In practice this is less of an issue because, at least for now, even if Alzheimer's is caught early no one knows how to cure it anyway.
</li><li> The fantastically elaborate design of the stuxnet worm managed to override every safety system used to ensure that the gas centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear facility couldn't malfunction. The whole system, from the Windows operating system of the controlling workstation to the SCADA PLD controlling the speed of the centrifuges was essentially taken over by the worm. The worm even managed to make the SCADA system "lie" to the computer connected to it by playing back the data from a normal run, à la Speed, as the PLD caused the centrifuges to spin out of control. This was caused deliberately of course, but it shows that human ingenuity, as well as human stupidity, can override failsafe systems.
<ul><li> Which is the reason why any reactor is not in any way connected to the outside world other than maybe a simple telephone (which is a separate entity as well to be extra sure).
</li><li> Thanks to USB drives and the genius at Microsoft who thought "let's allow plug and play media to run programs as soon as inserted without the user knowing" that's not a problem.
<ul><li> While that was a dumb design flaw in Windows (since fixed), ask yourself why computers in that sensitive facility even <em>had</em> USB ports? The ports should have been plugged, or otherwise physically disconnected...except those ports were needed to accept the PLC program code which was then transferred to the SCADA units themselves. The SCADA units were physically airgapped <em>but</em> needed a way to receive programming. The worm tampered with the PLC code on the Windows computer before it was sent to the USB drives and from there to the SCADA units. Thus Stuxnet becomes one of the rarest types of malware: able to use Sneakernet to <em>jump an air gap</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Stuxnet worm is a bit of a special case, as it was not only designed to cause the system to fail but, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">TV Tropes is not necessarily saying it was designed with the help of the company who built the centrifuges...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The failsafes in the Fukushima Daiichi (Fukushima I, that's a roman numeral one) nuclear power plant worked as intended after the 11 March 2011 earthquake in Japan, safely stopping all three of its working reactors. But then the tsunami came and washed out all the emergency diesel generators that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">some genius</a> placed right at the shore, and the plant's connection to the grid was severed by the quake. So the plant lost cooling at all of its six reactors, which led to the successive meltdowns of at least three of them.
<ul><li> What happened to the diesel generators is known as a "common mode failure" in engineering circles, and it's one of the hardest hazards to anticipate and prepare for.
<ul><li> The proposed Molten Salt Reactor design uses fuel that has to be in a melted state for the reactor to work, and keeps the core from draining by constantly cooling a flattened section of pipe to keep a plug of salt frozen so that if power to the reactor's building is lost, the plug of salt melts and the fuel-salt drains into a passively-cooled drain-tank that's configured to prevent nuclear fission from happening, averting this trope in the simplest possible way: powering the safety system entirely by the force of <strong>gravity</strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> Even that might have been dealt with because of another safety measure designed in: the reactor power system had the capability of getting electricity from truck-mounted mobile generators, which were, in fact, on scene within a few hours. Only problem was that no one had verified that the generators and the power system they were supposed to supply emergency power for had compatible attachments for the power cables.
</li></ul></li><li> The Russian submarine <em>Kursk</em> sank due to one such design flaw: a faulty torpedo was able to leak hydrogen peroxide, which proceeded to react with the torpedo <em>casing</em>, causing the first explosion which then set off the fuel and munitions in the torpedo bay. There are arguably several flaws in the design that let this happen (starting with explosions ideally not being the immediate consequence of a <em>leaky pipe</em>).
<ul><li> Even this would not have been a problem had there not been a ventilation duct through the bulkhead. The bulkhead itself was strong enough to contain the explosion of the first torpedo (which itself had not had its welds tested since it was only a dud and thus had no warhead), but the vent was not, and thus allowed the blast to get through, and incapacitate everyone in the command room in the second compartment. The torpedo tube door itself should also have contained the blast, but it was a common issue that the doors often required several tries to properly close due to bad contacts. Finally the emergency buoy which should have automatically released in the event of a catastrophic failure was disabled after concerns during a previous mission in the Mediterranean that it would trigger accidentally and give away the submarine's position.
</li><li> Almost exactly the same accident befell HMS <em>Sidon</em> in 1955 (except that the rest of the crew were able to evacuate), and resulted in the British Navy dropping that torpedo design several decades earlier. Russia was basically either lucky or unlucky enough (depending on your point of view) to avoid similar incidents during the 20th century.
</li></ul></li><li> The power outage during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl XLVII</a> was ironically caused by the failsafe <em>itself</em>. A power relay, which was supposed to activate and relay power from another source in case of an outage, activated when it wasn't supposed to, causing a partial blackout in the stadium.
</li><li> Stories like these are generally mass circulated in maintenance circles as a reminder for safety and reason for preemptive inspection. Verifying the numerous safety pins and indicators in an ejector seat before even touching it because a system capable of sending a grown man eighty feet in the air in under two seconds doesn't leave much behind if the aircraft is inside a hanger with a forty-foot ceiling. Overpressurizing an aircraft system has caused an aircraft to crack in half. Altering the bell mouth of a fuel manifold so it doesn't knock against a back nut for a fuselage panel that was preventing it from forming a vacuum seal and caving in the manifold.
</li><li> sudo (in POSIX style operating systems) and UAC (in Windows) is a failsafe, sort of, to make the user aware that whatever they're going to do may have an impact on the system. When used, most programs that try to do an action that will cause system changes will trigger this. Bypassing it, by either running as root or disabling UAC (or even <a class="urllink" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160816-00/?p=94105">leaving the latter at its default "recommended" setting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), will allow a program to do whatever it wants.
<ul><li> Similarly Android has on its security options a checkbox to allow to install app packages bypassing the Google Playstore. It's desactivated by default and if you check it, it will warn you of possible damages -so have fun if that apk file that supposedly had a game contains also something much nastier-.
</li></ul></li><li> An example of a double failsafe failure. After several tragic mid-air collisions (most notably over India in November 1996, claiming 349 lives) a system was introduced to prevent such collisions from happening: all airliners were equipped with TCAS (Traffic and Collision Avoidance System), detecting other aircraft on a collision course and telling the crew if they should climb or descend to avoid a crash. Then, in January 2001, two Japan Airlines aircraft with a total of 677 lives onboard nearly collided over Suruga Bay, even though both of them were equipped with properly working TCAS - because at the same time the crews received commands from the ATC controller to avoid a collision, and those ATC commands were contradictory with the TCAS commands: one of the crew followed TCAS and disregarded ATC, the other followed ATC and disregarded TCAS; the two aircraft passed each other by 35 feet (11 metres). The Japanese investigation commission asked the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) to establish a clear set of rules whose commands have a priority in such situation. For some reason though, the ICAO ignored the pleas and seventeen months later, two aircraft collided over southern Germany for exactly the same reasons, killing 70. Only then were the TCAS commands were given absolute priority.
</li><li> Over the course of WWII, the Germans attempted to add failsafes to the bombs they dropped on England in order to create more and more complicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">Wire Dilemma</a> situations that would hopefully kill British bomb disposal technicians. Occasional instances of this trope allowed the British to safely disassemble the new bomb types and figure out how the failsafes worked and from there how to disarm the bombs when they weren't broken. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">in this case</a>, the feature that failed was a fail-<em>deadly</em>, the failure of which caused the bomb to fail-safe, which is to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheresTheKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheresTheKaboom">the bomb didn't work.</a>
</li><li> Probably the worst known roller coaster incident in history occurred on the Battersea Funfair Big Dipper on 30 May 1972. The lift chain malfunctioned, followed by the anti-rollback mechanism, and the train rolled back to the station and collided with the other train. Five children died and another 13 were injured. The park struggled on for another 16 months, before closing at the end of the 1974 season.
</li><li> The Smiler roller coaster at Alton Towers​ suffered a bad incident (although not as bad as the Battersea incident) on 2 June 2015; the operator, following standard procedure, sent a test train around the track, but assumed that it had completed the circuit instead of checking that it had. He then sent a passenger train, and the ride safety systems detected the impending collision and shut down the ride — and the operator assumed that this was a malfunction in the safety systems, and manually restarted the ride without doing any further checking, probably using a key he wasn't supposed to have.
</li><li> Class D cargo holds were designed to be airtight in order to starve cargo fires of oxygen, preventing them from bringing down a plane. However, in the case of ValuJet Flight 592, the fire was caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">incorrectly declared, unsafely packaged oxygen generators</a>, resulting in a self-sustaining inferno that brought the DC-9 down within minutes, killing all 110 occupants. Class D holds were discontinued after the accident because the FAA realised how useless hoping a cargo fire would peter out was.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_activation_device">Automatic activation devices<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are lifesaving devices in skydiving, and they are intended to automatically deploy the reserve parachute if the main has failed or is not opened and flying at certain altitude. They have saved hundreds of lives, but sometimes they can fail disastrously. As they register the air pressure changes and acceleration, they can sometimes fire unintentionally if the skydiver tries something daring at very low altitudes, resulting in both main and reserve canopies flying simultaneously. There are three possible <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParachuteMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParachuteMalfunction">malfunctions</a>: <em>biplane</em>, where the canopies are one above each other, <em>side-by-side</em> where the canopies are aside each other and <em>downplane</em> where they are <em>vertically</em> aside each other, creating no lift. Biplane and side-by-side are mere nasty nuisances, but the downplane malfunction is likely to be fatal unless the skydiver a) has enough altitude and b) manages to perform immediately main cutaway. And pray...
</li><li> This is believed to have contributed to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinton_train_collision">Hinton train collision<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Canada in 1986. A CN freight train ran a red signal and collided head-on with a passenger train, killing 23 people, including the crew in the engine. While the lead locomotive was equipped with a "dead man's pedal," the subsequent investigation found that it was common practice for CN crew to keep the pedal depressed with a heavy object so they didn't need to keep their feet on it. The engineer was found to have a number of health problems that put him at high risk for a heart attack or stroke. It also didn't help that the crew was also suffering from a severe lack of sleep due to the shifting train schedules. One possible explanation is that the engineer was incapacitated and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadFootLeadfoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadFootLeadfoot">the dead man's pedal depressed, the train kept running when it should have stopped</a>. Ironically, the second engine had a newer reset safety control that didn't require engineers to keep their feet on the pedal, but it wasn't used because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">the cab wasn't as comfortable</a>. After the accident, the railroad industry moved toward these safer controls.
</li><li> Modern internal combustion engines with multi-gear transmissions have at least two failsafes to protect the engine, transmission and/or drivetrain from catastrophic overspeed failures. The first is a governer that automatically shuts off the fuel flow at or slightly above redline. The second is a set of interlocks in the transmission meant to prevent gear changes from placing the engine, transmission, and/or drivetrain into a state that will either severely damage or destroy any part of them. These are not new technologies. The former has been around since the 1940s (early gas turbines had them) and maybe even earlier. The latter was a standard feature of mid-80s Honda 5-speed manual transmissions (5th to reverse wasn't possible without stopping at neutral along the way). If both fail you probably just totaled your car.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buncefield_fire">Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 2005 is believed to have been caused by a gauge malfunctioning, preventing the computer controlling the pumps from realising that a tank was full to overflowing and allowing petrol to pour out through the ventilators in the roof (another failsafe, ironically, designed to allow fuel vapour to disperse safely) until it found a source of ignition. This leak might have been noticed before it became disastrous if the failure hadn't occurred at 6AM on a Sunday, when there was only a skeleton crew on site, although the timing also meant that nobody was in several nearby industrial and office buildings that were trashed when the first explosion occurred. Either way, the end result was a fire that took three-quarters of the Hertfordshire county fire brigade two days to bring under control, property damage in the hundreds of millions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives">no fatalities.</a>
</li><li> Qantas Flight 72 is probably the ultimate example of a failsafe failure, where the failsafe didn't just contribute to or fail to prevent a disaster, but single-handedly caused one. A single line of corrupted code caused the plane's computer to erroneously believe the plane was flying at an incredibly high angle and therefore in danger of stalling, triggering two different failsafes (one related to angle, the other to stall prevention), which brought the plane's nose down ten degrees between them. However, the plane was in reality flying level, so the ten-degree pitch-down sent the plane into a dangerous dive. Fortunately, the pilots were able to regain control before the plane crashed, but the sudden change in gravitational force meant that anything and anyone that wasn't strapped down or similarly restrained was thrown around the cabin, which resulted in dozens of injuries.
</li><li> Flaws in anti-stalling software were determined to be the cause of the 737 MAX crashes in early 2019; a glitch while the planes were taking off would record the plane as stalling and force a correction, which the crew would try to re-correct causing a back and forth struggle that ultimately caused the planes to spiral out of control and crash. To make matters worse, there was indication that Boeing knew of the faulty software but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">pushed the MAX out anyway</a>, getting them in further hot water when the plane was grounded for the rest of the year.
