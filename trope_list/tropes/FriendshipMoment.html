<ul><li> Ohtori offering to give up his spot on the Hyoutei team for Shishido, because he believes Shishido has earned it, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>.
</li><li> Many many instances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, with Tsuna gaining a backbone to stand up and fight for his "family". Most definitely happening more and more as the series goes on and Tsuna matures.
</li><li> Ganta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> has one while protecting Shiro from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a berserk Nagi</span>, giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> while taking all the blows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Epic promises for one of them to be the best, Kuina talking about her problems concerning being a female swordsman with Zoro and his simply listening to her is rather touching in itself, especially when you consider the latter's personality.
<ul><li> Another epic moment was the Straw Hats went to rescue Robin, who offered herself to the government for their safety (a Friendship Moment in itself), essentially declaring war on the entire world. The Straw Hats don't know why the government wanted Robin or how Robin used to be betrayed by every single person she had met. Luffy points out that no matter what, no matter what burden or difficulty Robin had faced, they would still come for her.
</li><li> It's a small one, but it counts. Especially when you consider that both Chopper and Zoro have trouble in the friends department. While they are in the desert and Usopp, Luffy and Sanji are arguing over water, Zoro holds out his canteen to Chopper and offers him some. Chopper politely declines. What makes it so special is that the other characters are being so selfish and yet both Zoro and Chopper are willing to go without for the other. Not to mention that Zoro has been dragging Chopper through the desert almost the entire time.
</li><li> One of the most epic moments comes in the Arlong arc, when all of the money Nami was earning over the years to buy her village back was taken by a corrupt Marine and her village decided to fight Arlong despite having no chance to win. Luffy appears, stopping Nami when she was furiously stabbing her arm where Arlong's tattoo was. She screams at him to go away but soon crumbles into tears and begs him to help her. He puts his treasured hat on her and proclaims of course he will. Then the camera pans to the rest of the Straw Hats who all agree without hesitation to help her. This was probably <em>the</em> moment when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> became the tight-knit crew that they are today.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> has multiple, though there is one that shows to what extremes some of them are willing to go to for their friends. Case in point, Ryo admits that the reason he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tried to kill Haru and Hana and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">supposedly succeeded</a> in Hana's case</span> was because their presence caused Ango emotional pain. And he wanted to protect him from it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Asuna and Ayaka</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> get one of these first when Ayaka agrees to drop the trip to Wales argument, then later when she sees the Ala Alba off. Ayaka's last words to Asuna were to keep Negi safe, then when Asuna says she will no matter how much injury she takes, Ayaka yells at her to stay safe as well.
<ul><li> Chapter 350 has another one between Asuna and Ayaka. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Starting the next day, Asuna is going to be asleep for 100 years, so they will most likely never see each other again. After a fight that ends with Ayaka hugging Asuna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryCute">while crying her eyes out</a>, Asuna hugs her back and says the following:</span>
<div class="indent">Negi and Nagi-San... Takahata-sensei... Konoka and Setsuna-san... I've met a lot of people since then. But, well... meeting you might have been the best luck I've had in my life.
</div></li><li> Ayaka and Asuna's relationship is built on these kind of moments, whether it be Asuna having Negi spend the day with Ayaka on the anniversary of her stillborn brother's death, Ayaka comforting Asuna when she's rejected by Takamichi, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ayaka living to 115 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">by sheer willpower</a> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">she could see Asuna one last time</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> lives and breathes this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, these are most often told through the flashback stories (chapters designated by negative numbers or decimal points).
<ul><li> Chapter 0.8, <em>a wonderful error</em>, is when Mizuiro realizes that Ichigo appreciated his honesty, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">not the thug</a> that Keigo made him out to be.
</li><li> Chad's flashback when Ichigo promises to fight for him, because Chad refuses to do so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">for himself</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens a <em>lot</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>; some examples that especially come to mind are everyone standing up for Tamaki in episode 14, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to save the club in the last two episodes</span>, and especially Kyoya <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">running all around France during a school trip for the sake of finding Tamaki's mother and proving that she was all right</span>.
<ul><li> Also in the manga, when the entire school <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bands together to get Tamaki to the airport before his mother's plane takes off without his having seen her. They bring in things like boats, helicopters, and cars to get him there</span> despite many merely being customers of the host club or other students.
</li></ul></li><li> When Sasuke asks <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> why he cares about him so much Naruto's response is to smile and say "Because we're friends".
</li><li> In the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, there's a marathon coming up, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">frail</a> Yutaka has decided to run it, despite her worries. Minami offers to run alongside, but Yutaka wants her to do her best, as well, instead of hanging back with her. The day of the marathon comes, and while the athletic Konata wants Minami to go easy on them, but Minami is going to comply with her friend's wishes. After running a while, Yutaka is about to give out, when she sees and hears Minami up ahead, cheering her on! Did she sacrifice her position in the race? But then, she sees the ribbon attached to her shirt. Minami ran to the end, collected her ribbon, <em>and came back to cheer her on</em>. This gives Yutaka the encouragement needed to finish. Afterward, Konata sees Yutaka, Minami, and Hiyori together, and points them out to Kagami.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kagami</strong>: Oh, I get it. No way you can beat that.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>: When Crona first comes to Shibusen, Kid throws a party in their honour, and Crona is confused about why the main grouping is being nice to him/her. The answer:
<div class="indent">Isn't it obvious? We're your friends.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidsOnTheSlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidsOnTheSlope">Kids on the Slope</a></em>: Karou tries very hard to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">the people</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">he loves</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">happy</a>.

There are a lot of moments between him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePArtners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePArtners">Sentaro</a>, such as when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWillNotCrySoICryForHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWillNotCrySoICryForHim">when Kaoru cries</a> when he learns about Sen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>, when they comfort each other when the other is having a major crisis, and when Kaoru goes after Sen when he runs away.
<ul><li> Also, whenever they play "their song" together ("Moanin'", which is the first song they play together and is used to reunite them twice).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> has Gon and Killua, whose moments border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>. Such as Gon readily admitting that Killua is his 'best friend in the world', while Killua privately thinks how glad he is to have met Gon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallThePathToPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallThePathToPower">Dragon Ball: The Path to Power</a></em> has the entire scene with Goku and Android 8 having a snowball fight, whose purpose is to highlight their friendship and how Goku is still a kid at the end of the day.
</li><li> Subverted and played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademiaTrainingOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademiaTrainingOfTheDead">My Hero Academia - Training of the Dead</a></em>. A zombiefied Habuko initially seems to remember Tsuyu and doesn't seem like she'll bite her, much to Tsuyu's relief...until Aoyama does instead. Now, the friends are zombies together!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessSarah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessSarah">Princess Sarah</a></em>, this trope, alone, often single-handedly keeps Sarah from sinking deep into despair. For examples, we have: Ermengarde refusing to betray Sarah even under threat of punishment, Peter helping Sarah with her arduous errands, Monsieur Dufarge giving her a book, Lottie standing up for "Mamma Sarah" when Lavinia tries to take her doll away, and just about every scene involving Becky in the middle of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone">Dr. Stone</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a> blacksmith Kaseki observes the friendship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Geniuses</a> Senku and Chrome, and laments the fact that he didn't have friends growing up because nobody else shared his love of inventing and crafting.

Tony Stark came up asking for a job. In the past few months he had lost his company, lost access to his money, gave up being Iron Man and became homeless. Not only that but he had only spent a week being sober. Tony was afraid that he would be rejected for what happened. But Rhodey and the others promptly accepted him.

It doesn't help that Tony has built a prototype suit, though Tony insists it is "therapy". At first, Tony thinks it is simply the suit's interface not being properly synched to Rhodey, but Rhodey's headaches keep coming back, and he finally goes on a rampage. Stark has to suit up in his outmatched prototype to try to calm him down, and manages to use everything he knows about the Iron Man suit to temporarily disable Rhodey's suit. Tony then takes off his suit, telling Rhodey that he doesn't want the job back, and unfreezes Rhodey's suit. Rhodey gets up... and shakes Tony's hand.

</div></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Cruelly (but hilariously) subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em>: In a moment of supreme generosity Percy movingly offers his life savings to bail out a bankrupted Blackadder... but discovers that Edmund had long since stolen the money and spent it.
<ul><li> And he still plunged to new depths to help him out of that mess later.
</li></ul></li><li> Tom Paris and Harry Kim in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "The Chute": Harry faces down a mob that wants to beat up Tom. "This man is my friend. <em>Nobody</em> touches him!"
<ul><li> Reinforced at the end of the episode when Harry apologizes to Tom for going crazy, and Tom says that he remembers Harry saying the line, and is grateful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> as a whole is responsible for a massive, massive number of these, and while there are entirely too many to list, one that stands out is the TOS episode "The Empath", in which McCoy knocks out both Kirk and Spock in order to sacrifice himself to the Enemy of the Week.
</li><li> Data and Deanna have a more subtle <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WfV0K00JM">moment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the end of the TNG episode "Tin Man". Deanna's is an empath who relies on emotions to do her job while Data can't even seem to understand them. So to see this moment, and the quiet wonder of Deanna's face as she realises "My god, he <em>gets</em> it." seriously tugged the heartstrings.
<div class="indent"><strong>Data:</strong> Through joining... they have been healed. Grief has been transmuted to joy, loneliness to... belonging.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Deanna:</strong> Data? You <em>do</em> understand.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Data:</strong> Yes, Counselor. When Tin Man returned me to the Enterprise, I realized... this is where *I* belong.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the earliest ones happens in Deep Space 9's circle three-parter, after two seasons of the Starfleet/Bajoran crew slowly getting used to each other. When Kira is reassigned off the station, several characters drop by in quick succession to either argue with her for not challenging the decision, return borrowed items, or congratulate her for an apparent promotion—unsurprisingly it soon devolves into a loud, confused argument that continues for some time until Vedek Bariel unexpectedly walks in and Kira has to explain.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Kira:</strong> These are... [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a> as she realizes] these are my friends.
</div></li><li> At the end of "Body Parts", Quark sits in the empty space that used to be his bar, all his possessions and business assets having been confiscated. Rom comes in to console him, and after a little bit... cue practically every non-Ferengi on the station coming up with contrived, mock-cynical, Quark-esque excuses to set up the bar exactly as it was. For a Ferengi who lives by his culture's avaricious ideals, this moment left him genuinely speechless.
</li></ul></li><li> Sawyer routinely gets these moments on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, giving them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> nature as well. He has three of them in the season 4 finale alone: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">going after the helicopter with Jack, going after Hurley at the Orchid, and jumping out of the helicopter to prevent Hurley from doing so.</span>
</li><li> Surprisingly enough, this has appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. One moment in the pilot shows House taking on a medical case he doesn't want to take because he thinks the patient is Wilson's cousin. There is also a season two episode where House has mistreated Wilson as per usual, and worriedly asks if the two of them are okay. In most cases, those wouldn't count as Friendship Moments, but given that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">House</a>...
<ul><li> Don't forget he tried to infect Steve MQueen (his pet rat, not the actor) with the disease that is killing Foreman in order to diagnose it.
</li><li> In Season 5's "The Social Contract," House finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wilson's schizophrenic younger brother Daniel has been found</span> and that Wilson is about to see him again for the first time since they were in school. After making his usual set of snarks, House 180's and concludes "and you'll probably need some company." (Eventually subverted by the fact that House has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> <em>right</em> before Wilson is supposed to go in and misses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the brother's reunion</span> because he's on the phone with his team. Corrected a few scenes later when House asks Wilson if everything went alright.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>: Buffy had many of these, but perhaps the crowning one on the show is in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS6E22Grave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS6E22Grave">Grave</a>" when Xander <em>freaking saves the world</em> with the power of his love for Willow and the depth of their friendship is enough to pull Willow away from some of the blackest magic EVER.
<ul><li> There is another more low-key, Xander moment in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E1TheFreshman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E1TheFreshman">The Freshmen</a>". A lonely, depressed and injured Buffy runs into Xander at the Bronze, who crouches down before her, proposal-like, and tells her: "You're my hero. Now let's go put that bitch in the ground!"
</li><li> Xander does get the majority of these moments, his "You're extraordinary" speech he delivers to Dawn in the 7th season being another.
<ul><li> Which was also a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As of Season 8, they are together</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole gang gets one towards Tara in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E6Family" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E6Family">Family</a>": "We are her blood kin, who are you?!" "We're family"
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg">Except Spike</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Buffy and Willow have their greatest alienation at the end of Season 6, with Willow attacking, calling Buffy 'superbitch', etc. When Willow returns at the start of Season 7 and is injured. Buffy joins hands with her, so Willow can take some of Buffy's energy to heal faster.
</li><li> Another one in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E21Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E21Primeval">Primeval</a>", when after their friendship has nearly been broken apart by Spike's machinations, Buffy tells Willow "you're my best friend" and not long after the two hug Xander. This is also a funny one because of Xander's response:
<div class="indent"><strong>Buffy:</strong> Xander! <br/><strong>Willow:</strong> Oh, our wonderful Xander! <br/><strong>Buffy:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove">You know we love you, right?</a> <br/><strong>Xander:</strong> Oh God, we're gonna die, aren't we?
</div><ul><li> When the four main characters form a gestalt entity (Buffy=hand, Giles=brain, Willow=spirit), Xander is the Heart. The above examples are some of the reasons why. Of course, this completes the opposition to the stereotypes 'Men do the fighting, women are the emotional and supportive ones'.
</li></ul></li><li> And in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS6E19SeeingRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS6E19SeeingRed">Seeing Red</a>", when Xander says he doesn't know what he'd do without Buffy and Willow, to which she replies "Let's never find out".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown">Murphy Brown</a></em> was like a car whose battery was powered by these. The <em>FYI</em> crew may constantly bicker and fight, but damned if they won't drop everything at a moment's notice to go to the ends of the earth for each other if the stakes are high enough.
<ul><li> They would also often be delightfully subverted at the last possible moment. In one episode, <em>FYI</em> as a whole wins an award, and of course, everyone ends up bitching and moaning about which one of them deserves it the most. In their squabbling, they end up breaking said award into many pieces. With the award's fragments all in a box in front of them, Miles delivers an speech which causes a <em>massive</em> Friendship Moment... and it's ruined at the very last second when, off-screen, among the sounds of everyone sorting through the pieces of the award, Frank is heard saying, "Aw, Murph, you took the biggest piece!"
</li></ul></li><li> Many such moments occur on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>. J.D. and Turk, being the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, are the most common recipients. One of the best was Turk telling J.D. that without J.D.'s constant treating of him as though he could accomplish anything, Turk might not have got where he has in in life.
<ul><li> J.D. and Dr. Cox also have several, such as J.D. talking Cox out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa">Angst Coma</a> in season 5 with a long, quiet monologue about how proud he is of him, and that he's the kind of doctor J.D. has always wanted to be.
</li></ul></li><li> Pullo often shows his willingness to do just about anything for Vorenus on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>. However the biggest moment comes in the episode <em>the Spoils</em> when Vorenus (in spite of having claimed Pullo is dead to him) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> walks in and kicks some serious butt during a gladiator fight, which is supposed to be Pullo's execution, thereby saving his friend's life and risking the wrath of Caesar, all at the same time.</span>
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, Octavian keeps having moments like these in regards to Pullo and Vorenus as well, for example in a season two episode where he helps Pullo find Vorenus and even puts his own men to help search, even though Vorenus is fighting for the opposite army.
</li></ul></li><li> Howard and Vince of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a></em> are usually so antagonistic toward each other, it's hard to believe they're actually friends, but many episodes include sentimental moments where Howard and Vince are genuinely kind to each other, even sweet. Tends to end with a crimp.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Divide and Conquer" of season 4, Jack is sitting playing with his yoyo, with Daniel standing nearby watching.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Daniel:</strong> Yep, I think these are the Jack O'Neill moments I'll probably miss the most. <br/><strong>Jack:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> What?
</div></li><li> Those two have a lot of those, the "Spacemonkey" scene being one of the cutest. Daniel's death in season five drags the entire team into one long Friendship Moment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>: After butting heads the entire series (sometimes violently), Young and Rush have one in "Twin Destinies." The crew finally has a chance to return home, but Rush wants to stay behind to try to accomplish the ship's original mission. Rush tells Young how many people will need to stay behind, and there's a moment of confusion because Young didn't even consider the possibility of the two of them leaving.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rush:</strong> I've done the numbers...I need a minimum of twelve volunteers to stay behind and help fly the ship. <br/><strong>Young:</strong> Plus you and me? <br/><strong>Rush:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Young:</strong> Twelve plus you and me? <br/><strong>Rush:</strong> ...no, twelve total. <br/><strong>Young:</strong> So, ten then.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> and his team, they get <em>at least</em> one a season. A few that come to mind are: Wes helping them out of tight spots, even though they'd pretty much ditched him (justifiably), Fred telling Spike he's worth saving, and the following quote from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E22ToShanshuInLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E22ToShanshuInLA">To Shanshu in L.A.</a>", while Cordelia was in the hospital.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Doctor</strong>: <em>(To Angel)</em> Sir, you can't be in here! Are you family?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Angel</strong>: Yes!
</div><ul><li> And then there's this from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E07Offspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E07Offspring">Offspring</a>":
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Cordelia</strong>: Are you saying that you love me?

</div><div class="indent"> <strong>The Others</strong>: (Distantly) We love you, Angel!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Cordelia</strong>: We've been saying it all day, just in case that thing comes back to kill us all.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>, Fiona Glennane and Sam Axe are not what you'd call the tightest of friends (er, she's still not over that time he ruined one of her illegal arms deals), but in "Long Way Back", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Michael starts to ask Sam to finish the job and rescue Fiona if he happens to go down. Sam doesn't even let him finish before saying "oh, I'm getting Fi outta there no matter what . . . just don't tell her I said that"</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>: Jack flying from Washington to New York when Liz's pregnancy turns out to be a false alarm; in another episode, Tracy realising he's so rich he never needs to work again, but staying at TGS anyway to save Kenneth's job.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> episode <em>Moment of Truth</em>. All of it.
<ul><li> The episode "The Labyrinth of Gedref". Particular the line "I had no idea you were so keen to die for me." Just the whole scene.
</li><li> Any time Merlin and Guinevere interact in Season 3 will inevitably end with the viewer going: "D'awwww!"
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>"You look lovely."</em>
</div></li><li> Appears every so often on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, usually between Blair and Serena or Chuck towards Nate (though never Nate towards Chuck). Also the Non-Judging Breakfast Club, especially in the latter part of season one when they are all fighting with each other, but close the ranks and band together to help Serena.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> has a few. Some examples would be:
<ul><li> When Victor was interrogating the students over who took the attic key, Nina truthfully admitted it was her. Fabian covered for her, and then the rest of the students followed suit, including Patricia (who hated Nina at the time) and Jerome (who had a tendency to put himself before others).
</li><li> When Patricia had a bad dream in class and ran out in a panic, every other student got up and chased after her without any hesitation.
</li><li> Mara setting aside her jealousy and anger at Jerome and Joy's relationship in order to help them both get back together.
</li><li> Patricia and Alfie not hesitating to rejoin Sibuna in the second season, despite not knowing what's going on, and despite Nina wanting to keep them safe from harm.
</li><li> When Alfie got traumatized from his night in the cellar and then poisoned by fake elixir, Jerome's utter desperation and worry for his friend was a big show of love coming from someone who up to this point has been shown almost exclusively to be uncaring and selfish.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> has its fair share.
<ul><li> When Ted is injured in a car crash at the end of season 3, Lily calls Barney even though he and Ted aren't speaking. Barney announces "my best friend needs me!" and <em>runs</em> something like ninety blocks to the hospital—and gets there as the same time as a cab that had started at the same spot as him.
<ul><li> Only to get run over and seriously hurt, precipitating a bedside reconciliation with Ted. "You're not my friend, Barney, you're my brother."
</li></ul></li><li> Marshall telling Robin that they all love her, and that if she goes to Canada, they will come after her and bring her home.
</li><li> Barney flying across the country to persuade Lily to come back to New York, and never telling anyone he did it.
</li><li> In "Symphony of Illumination", when Robin is hiding the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she has just learned she can never have kids</span>, Ted keeps asking her what's wrong, which devolves into an argument ending with Robin snapping, "It's not your job to cheer me up." Much later, she enters the apartment to see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ted has decorated the entire place with lights set to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell"</span>. As she stares in amazement, he appears behind her and quietly says, "Yes, it is." He tells her it's ok if she won't tell him <em>why</em> she's upset, he's still there for her. Pretty much the definition of friendship, personified.
</li><li> Another for Ted and Robin early in season 3: after they backslide and have a one-night stand six months after their breakup, they decide to stop pretending to be friends and part ways after Thanksgiving dinner. However, when Bob offhandedly says the phrase "major buzzkill" in conversation, Ted and Robin instinctively give a synchronized military salute and chorus "Major Buzzkill!" (an old in-joke for them) and startled, lock eyes and realize that they <em>are</em> friends after all, while Future!Ted notes that "friendship is an involuntary reflex: it just happens, you can't help it."
</li><li> Ted selling his brand new car in order to give Marshall and Lily a sizable loan after Marshall ill-advisedly quits his job on the spur of the moment, gruffly saying "Marshall, don't make me scream at you" when Marshall starts babbling about how he can't accept something like that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: Some of the biggest Carly/Sam moments include their hug after they nearly get killed by falling from a building as a result of a fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> has small moments that come to mind:
<ul><li> Jayne crouching outside of the hospital room making sure Kaylee's all right.
</li><li> This, in "Safe."
<div class="indent"><strong>Patron:</strong> The girl is a witch. <br/><strong>Mal:</strong> Yeah, but she's our witch. <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock">Dramatic Gun Cock</a>]</em> So cut her the hell down.
</div></li><li> The two shuttles deciding separately to return to the captain, despite knowing that they'd likely die in "Out of Gas"
</li><li> Even smaller moments that show what a family both the crew and the actors had become. Mal grabbing Kaylee into a hug <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">on a whim</a> during "Ariel" and later gripping Kaylee's hand for just a second while walking past her on the stairs after she helped rescue him during War Stories. No other words of thanks needed.
</li><li> And offscreen there were plenty of these moments too. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s commentary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em> he mentions that during the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGiCkd1kBHU&amp;feature=related">"first rule of flying" scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which might also qualify this trope) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NathanFillion">Nathan Fillion</a> was anxious that he couldn't deliver the lines and keep them from sounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmy</a>... and then he said later, "I turned, I looked into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummerGlau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummerGlau">those two eyes</a> and that's where that speech came from." Awww.
</li><li> In fact, Mal and Jayne <em>need</em> these moments to prove they aren't totally screwed up jerks. Of course, a lot of their development gets restarted in the movie and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">basically end up where they were at the end</a> of <em>Firefly</em>.
<ul><li> At one point, Mal gives his (typical) threat of kicking Simon and River off the ship in <em>Serenity</em>... even though at the end of <em>Firefly</em> he would not have done that because they were part of his crew.
</li><li> Another at the end of "Ariel" after Jayne betrays Simon and River, nas
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"> "You turn on any of my crew, you turn on <em>me</em>!"
</div><ul><li> Simon's rescue of River.

Colby tries a spectacularly dangerous stunt to catch a suspect, which ends with him falling off a moving truck and hitting the ground hard. David runs to his side to help him up and inquire if he's okay.
</li><li> Also during this arc, if you watch carefully, every time David pushes Colby away, Megan is right there to check up on him and make sure he knows that <em>someone</em> still cares about him.
</li><li> David has a moment of this with one of his childhood friends in "Contenders". David and his friend spend most of the episode verbally sparring, but at the very end, once they've sorted out their differences, David hugs his friend and calls him "brother".

Of course, this show being what it is, the tender moment gets punctured when Roz's nurse mistakes him for the father and when he asks her out ("What about your w?"

In the first season episode "Ruskie Business", Meg (one of the few 09ers who still treats Veronica well) asks her to find her secret admirer. Near the end of the episode, as they're about to leave for an 80's dance together, Veronica discovers Meg's secret admirer is Duncan, Veronica's ex-boyfriend. Despite being thrown by this, at the dance itself, Veronica tells Meg to put on the corsage that was supposed to be a signal. When Duncan shows up, Veronica smiles at both of them and leaves (of course, she still has mixed feelings about it afterwards).
<ul><li> Meg herself performed a friendship moment from the same episode: she took Veronica to the dance because she had arranged for Leo D'Amato, a deputy whom Veronica had feelings for (the feelings were mutual), to show up.
</li><li> Veronica's relationship with her best friend, Wallace Fennel, is along the lines of her asking him to do favors for her, but in the episode "Betty and Veronica", it's revealed she's the one who's been leaving spirit boxes (Wallace is a star basketball player) full of cookies for him. When he discovers this, he says to her that he thought she hated those kinds of things (school spirit), and she says to him simply, "You don't." Later in the episode, she says about him, "Wallace Fennel has a killer crossover. But it's really his sweetness and purity of spirit that makes him unbeatable."

Not to mention almost all of the last chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> and the ending are just one huge Friendship Moment for them, as Zack continues to protect and talk to Cloud for about a year's worth of time on the run from Shinra.

The earliest notable example is when Owyn groggily comes to his senses after they've had to swim through a toxic frozen river and finds Gorath standing over him in concern.
<div class="indent"><strong>Owyn:</strong> "If you EVER put us through that again, I will invent a cantrip whose sole purpose... is to cause you to fall desperately in love with a warthog — may the two of you live happily ever after!" <br/><strong>Gorath:</strong> <em>(smiles)</em> "I'm glad your sense of humor has returned.

</li><li> Considering how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> is a major recurring theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> series, such moments are not at all uncommon in it:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has several of these, from little ones, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> Sten calling you "kadan" (effectively, close friend), to larger ones, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> Morrigan managing to stammer out that while she may not always prove worthy of your friendship, she values it deeply.
<ul><li> Also shows up in the Fade quest. Your Warden can go into each companion's prison dream and basically use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> and reasoning to break them out. Then, when you face the Sloth demon keeping you all there, they show up to back you up. They tell him that he separated them because Sloth split up the team of skilled combatants, but he failed. These <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">true companions</a> found each other anyway, and they're gonna <em>destroy him</em>!
</li><li> And if you elect to be captured rather than fight at the conclusion of the "Rescue the Queen" quest, you can select two of your friends to mount a rescue. No matter who they are or how much they like or hate each other, they will be worried about you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> has a lot of these between Hawke and the companions, if the former takes time to get to know the latter and become friends/rivals with them. One particular example is the free-spirited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateGirl">Pirate Girl</a> Isabela who, at the end of act two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">will run away with the Tome of Koslun - but, if she considers Hawke her friend/rival/lover, will then return and hand the Tome over to the Qunari—all while blaming Hawke for having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContagiousHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContagiousHeroism">bad influence on her</a></span>. Also, in the endgame, every companion (except Isabela and Varric) will have a stand in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mage-Templar confrontation</span> and if Hawke sides with the other faction, they will leave the party... unless their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">friendship/rivalry is maxed out</a>, in which case they will display extreme discomfort but put their trust in Hawke anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> also has a number of these between the Inquisitor and his/her companions. One particularly standout instance is the Wicked Grace game which can be played after Varric's personal quest is completed. Not only is the entire scene filled with such moments, but afterward, Varric and the Inquisitor have a beautiful moment in which he talks about how much he respects them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a></em> has numerous such incidents, but one that stands out is an easily missed partner conversation that takes place right after one of your sidekicks, Double H, recovers from an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">virus.</a> Protagonist Jade makes a rather... <em>mangled</em> attempt at quoting to him from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">Big Book of War</a>, and, with a laugh, he corrects her. While they've been <em>working together</em> for a while now, this shows that they're truly <em>friends</em> now.
<ul><li> There's another one later; Jade asks him what said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">Big Book of War</a> would recommend in their current situation; essentially giving him the opportunity to opt out if he doesn't feel up to the challenge.

A notable one is the end of Tali's - if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> manage to keep her from getting exiled without telling the Conclave what her father did,</span> she and Shepard will share a nice little moment.

</div><ul><li> A particular scene from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a>, which tends to leave few gamers unmoved, provided they made the right choices in the previous game:

</li><li> If she's chosen as the biotic specialist in the suicide mission, Jack will call Shepard "Commander". She has had nothing but hatred for every form of authority for her entire life.
</li><li> Shepard can get drunk with Dr Chakwas for one of these.
</li><li> Joker and EDI share one when Joker calls the AI a 'she'.
</li><li> Face it, the entire game is BUILT of moments like these.
</li></ul></li><li> The Flanoir scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> is a cementing Friendship Moment between Lloyd and whoever else you choose (excepting possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Colette</a>). Notably, if you pick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Sheena</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">'friendship' declaration from Lloyd</a> ends up annoying her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2">inFAMOUS 2</a></em> has one when Cole and Zeke take a break from saving the world <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPiJDAAHHdo">by watching a western and drinking some beer.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> When someone tries to call them on the phone they wordlessly agree to ignore it and just relax. Hours later they fall asleep on the couch in what can only be desribed as a platonic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepCute">Sleep Cute</a> position. This is in stark contrast where their friendship was on the rocks due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zeke betraying Cole and trying to join Kessler to get powers</span> at the end of the first game, and shows that their friendship has finally recovered.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters">Little Busters!</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou">Sasami</a>, who sees herself as a fierce rival of Rin's and whom she constantly fights with, occasionally tries to make overtures of friendship. They usually fail, though, because Rin sees her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">neither as a rival</a> nor as a potential friend, but rather an annoying girl she has no particular good or ill will towards. They do get a genuine moment in the short Sasami-centered miniroute, though, where Rin finds Sasami's softball glove but gives it back to her when she sees how much it means to her. Sasami is clearly touched.
<ul><li> And later, in Refrain, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Riki is tasked with single-handedly reforming the Little Busters while Kyousuke is framed as an antagonist at best and a bitter loser going through some serious depression at best.</span> One night, Riki goes to his room to see if he's okay, and Kyousuke notices that he's struggling and asks if something's wrong. It isn't much, but it's enough to tell Riki that deep down, Kyousuke does still care about him and want him to be happy.

For his part, Sigfried never even once shows any sign of suspicion or aversion that most others treat Geralt with just because he is a mutant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>, Shadow and Rouge share a moment after Shadow learns that Omega would eventually be forced to imprison him in the future, due to Iblis being released.

<ul><li> "I Am Legion": Shayera has a few brief moments of concern after thinking Flash has fallen to his doom because Fire <em>dropped him</em> from a great height. Of course, he shows up five seconds later, completely fine and with his usual... dumb spectacular-ism, Shayera's response is a loud <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry">"Don't you EVER scare me like that again!"</a>
<div class="indent"> <strong>Flash</strong>: <em>She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only... You know, short.</em>
</div><ul><li> Flash gets a few of these, actually. It's kinda his thing, since he pretty much gets along with everyone. Even some of his own Rogues.
</li><li> "The Ties That Bind": Flash goes on a rant when he thinks J'onn is about to chastise him for helping Barda and Mr Miracle after J'onn said they weren't getting involved. Turns out that's not what J'onn had in mind at all.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Flash</strong>: <em>So, yeah! I did go behind your back, but you know what? I'd do it again! What do you say to that, big guy?</em>

</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"pull Flash from the Speed Force"</span> moment in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of Season 4.

Specifically Diana's joy at seeing him. Wonder Woman doesn't just up and hug everyone she meets, you know.
</li><li> <em>Hawk and Dove</em>: Hawk fighting back against <em>Wonder Woman</em> who's restraining him to keep him from running into the battlefield where his brother Dove is apparently about to be pulverised by the Annihilator. Hawk doesn't do sappy. This is the closest he'll ever get.
</li><li> In <em>Unlimited</em>'s predecessor series, the episode <em>A Better World</em> where John finds Hawkgirl, who was injured during a battle with their alternate selves and was being treated in freaking <em>Arkham Asylum</em> (a cleaned up, totally lobotomized, well furnished Arkham Asylum, but still...). The expression on his face said it all. Also something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.
</li><li> <em>Eclipsed</em>: Flash prevents the world from ending by <em>running into the sun</em> carrying the device that will prevent it from being completely destroyed.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Green Lantern</strong>: <em>He's in one piece. I think he's alright.</em> [to an unconscious Flash] <em>You hear me, buddy? You <strong>better</strong> be alright!</em>

<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> [Smiles] Always <strong>have</strong> to be the hero, don't you?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Batman:</strong> [Smiles back] Right back at you.
</div></li><li> The reunion after the two-parter where Superman was zapped, presumed dead by all but Batman, but really "sent to the future, and then Vandal Savage and I fought some giant cockroaches, and now I'm back." (He left out the forging his own sword and skinning wolves and stuff).
<ul><li> From the same two-parter; Batman making a heartfelt speech to Big Blue's tombstone, privately detailing his 'utmost respect' for his more straight-laced counterpart
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> had Danny's two best friends, Tucker and Sam, continuously in disgruntled mode when they feel he treats them more as sidekicks than best friends. Just when they're on the last edge, they see their friend has been kidnapped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and spends the second half of the episode rescuing him. The Friendship Moment part comes when Danny ecstatically and happily thanks his friends over and over. The idea that Tucker and Sam would still stick by their buddy despite how he treats them (unintentionally, that is), is just an Awwww factor there.
</li><li> Happens fairly frequently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Notably</a> when Zuko's trying to smooth the waters between himself and the Gaang, and keeps taking them on "lifechanging field trips" (usually at quite a risk to himself).
<ul><li> The cutest of these has to be when Toph reassures him during the intermission in "The Ember Island Players," gets him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">smile,</a> and punches him.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, whenever Sokka and Katara get separated, they always hug on being reunited. Look out for it; it's more common than you think.
</li><li> Arguably, Azula taking back her insult to Ty Lee and going to find Zuko at their old summer home in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a>. It's almost creepy, really: an Azula friendship moment?.
</li><li> And then there's when Ty Lee sides with Mai in The Boiling Rock. Which brings up a dark iteration of this trope later when it's revealed how much this affected Azula.
</li></ul></li><li> There are a few in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a> between Brian and Peter.
<ul><li> When Peter sneaked into a drug rehabilitation for a vacation, to join Brian who was addicted to cocaine. The head woman realized that the troublemaking Peter knew Brian, she blamed Peter for Brian's drug addiction. Brian stood up to her and said that Peter took him as family... and promptly left with Peter.
</li><li> Another is where they along with Joe and Quagmire are put under a simulation by Stewie where they are in a ruined Quahog and without their memories. Done in an attempt to prove Brian and Peter's friendship was one of convience, the episode proves that Brian and Peter really were meant to best friends, something that Stewie acknowledges.
</li><li> In "Brian &amp; Stewie", Brian admits his gun is in case he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wants to commit suicide</span>. Stewie calls him selfish, saying he can't live without his best friend. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicDeclarationOfLove">Platonic Declaration of Love</a> follows, which Brian reciprocates.
</li></ul></li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> when Eddy, after abusing and insulting Double D the entire episode Screams at the Kankers to leave Double D alone, because he had been tormented enough. He immediately gave Ed and Double D hot dogs so they would ignore it.
<ul><li> In the movie, Eddy annoys Double D for most of the movie. Once Eddy crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> and tricks Double D into thinking he was dying, Double D, enraged, turns away from the group. Eddy immediately realizes what he's done and reconciles Double D.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> had a <em>lot</em> of these.
<ul><li> In "Switched" a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> puts Raven in Starfire's body. Raven, normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, is at first completely incapable of using Starfire's emotionally driven superpowers, but uses them to great effect when her friends are threatened.
</li><li> In "Apprentice" Part II, Robin is forced to attack his friends. Starfire refuses to fight back and leaves herself defenseless against Robin's attack. She explains, "Robin, you are my best friend. I cannot be in a world where we must fight. If you are truly evil, then go ahead. Do what you must."
</li><li> Takes a dark turn in "The End" Part 1 when Raven decides to do whatever it takes to protect her friends, even if it means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">dooming the rest of the world in the process</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pretty much the entire reason for the show. Just one example is in part 2 of the series premiere, "Elements of Harmony", when Twilight hears her friends coming to back her up against Nightmare Moon and figures out how to activate the seemingly-destroyed Elements and awaken the sixth one.
</li><li> Speaking of Nightmare Moon, when Luna makes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">bombastic</a> appearance in "Luna Eclipsed," everyone is terrified of her, since she was little more than a scary story for a thousand years. Twilight tries to be friendly, and the first sign that it's working is when Luna compliments her on her historically accurate costume (which no one else recognized).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E2LisasRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E2LisasRival">Lisa's Rival</a>", Lisa found a rival in Alison - a girl who may have been smarter than her. At the end of the episode Lisa has gotten over her jealousy, she apologises to Allison.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lisa:</strong> Can we still be friends?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Alison:</strong> Only if we're the best.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Star</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Marco</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> have so many of these, no wonder they are the most shipped characters in the show.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>'s were between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Fry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Bender</a>, such as this exchange from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">original series finale</a> "The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings":
<div class="indent"><strong>Fry:</strong> Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?

<ul><li> The episode "Smarty Pants" ends with Timmy and AJ reconciling after they spent the episode rubbing their brains in each others faces, showing that despite fighting the whole episode they do care for each other.
</li><li> In "Foul Balled", Chester gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a> after Timmy wishes he was good at baseball.
