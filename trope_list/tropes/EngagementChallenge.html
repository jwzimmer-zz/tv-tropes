Prove yourself worthy; go and kill yon dragon," the King proclaims, and the heroes gather to win the fair damsel's hand - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTale">Fairy Tale</a> scenario still used today.
</p><p>Historically, used straight, as a way to get the story going.
</p><p>The reason for the challenge varies.
</p><ul><li> The king invented it to test the suitors for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin">princess's</a> hand. This is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>, but the test for a bride is very different: of domestic skills.
</li><li> The king uses it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward">lure heroes</a> to help the kingdom, which is sometimes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>.
</li><li> It features as a way to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">prince</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">princess</a> rescued; this is more often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>, but the precise challenges tend to differ according whether it is a hero or a heroine challenged, as the princess is more often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedToARock">Chained to a Rock</a> and the prince deathly ill and in need of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">magical healing</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The king does not want to see her married off and resorts to this as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>. The challenge is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">impossible</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUriahGambit">deadly</a>. It may be targeted at a particular suitor that the king needs to get rid of, or maybe the kingdom is infested with a surplus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbJock">Dumb Jock</a> types.
</li><li> It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>. For example, perhaps the king wants a very particular type of man to marry his daughter, and the man who tries to murder the (perfectly nice, intelligent, reasonable) dragon will fail, while the one who offers it some of his lunch will pass.
</li></ul><p>Sometimes the princess (or prince) lays down the challenge themselves. This tends to get treated with less sympathy.
</p><p>If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">the king</a> decides after all that fulfilling the challenge doesn't make you worthy (frequently if he didn't realize it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRoyalty">Rags to Royalty</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Dude, Where's My Respect?</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">Moving the Goalposts</a> may ensue; the opening Engagement Challenge was open to all comers, but the subsequent ones only to the peasant who succeeded — and quite frequently an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Task</a>. Occasionally, the king makes this promise in order to rid himself of someone, sending him to do something he doesn't want done but which, he thinks, will kill him. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">something he</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">does</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">want done but which will probably kill him</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Another problem is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">false hero</a>, who claims to have done the deed. Many false heroes have cut off the heads of the monster only to discover that the hero had already cut out their tongues. The heroine may be threatened to silence but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">will tell the truth if the hero is there to protect her</a>.
</p><p>These days there are usually complications. Sometimes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> set up the challenge, tricking the king into getting some naive hero to collect his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> or kill his enemies. Sometimes the hero befriends the poor misunderstood dragon but still gets the girl. Having a dragon at your side is an amazingly effective negotiating tool. Sometimes the hero completes the challenge without realizing there's a reward; a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Accidental Marriage</a> which can lead to some seriously miffed princesses. Of course, if the hero does want the marriage, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">more rebellious princesses</a> will often be highly scornful of the idea of marrying someone just because they can kill an overgrown lizard.
</p><p>With the cleverer heroes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">No Man of Woman Born</a> level conditions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a>-style wrangling may occur.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale">Fractured Fairy Tale</a> often plays with this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheherezadeGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheherezadeGambit">Scheherezade Gambit</a> enters into some variants where it is a test of wits rather than a test of courage.
</p><p>Sister trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompeteForTheMaidensHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompeteForTheMaidensHand">Compete for the Maiden's Hand</a>, where the challenge is imposed by one or more of the suitors against his rivals instead of by either the maiden or her guardian(s).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Elder</a> tells Kenichi that he would only allow him to propose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend">Miu</a> (Elder's granddaughter) if Kenichi beats him in a fight. Elder is known as "the man without enemies". It's even better in Japanese: "man without enemies" is the literal definition of the word "invincible". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though since in the epilogue he's married and had a daughter who looks like Miu, he's either beaten the elder or the older man has allowed the marriage anyway.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em>, a flashback reveals that Kyosuke's grandfather set up something like this for his father. The challenge was to bring snow down from the top of a mountain. As a normal human, Kyosuke's father was unable to complete the challenge... without help from the Esper he was seeking to marry.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHoneyNoSutekiNaBouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoneyHoneyNoSutekiNaBouken">Honey Honey no Suteki na Bouken</a></em>, the princess <em>herself</em> sets up the quest. She has rich suitors from around the world after her fabulous fortune, and frustrated at her options, she sticks her enormous diamond ring into a cooked fish and throws it outside. The main character's cat eats the fish, swallowing the ring, and runs off. The princess says whoever can retrieve the ring will marry her, setting off the events of the series, which is a wacky chase across Europe for a poor young waitress and her cat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, Ichigo's father challenges Aoyama to a kendo duel in order to let him continue seeing her. After Ichigo learns that he had been subjected to a similar challenge to continue seeing her mother, she, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">like her mother before her</a>, runs in and offers to continue the duel on Aoyama's behalf, convincing her father to accept him.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>. After Akito Takagi, while meeting with his girlfriend Kaya Miyoshi's parents, mentions the name of his partner Moritaka Mashiro, Kaya's father challenges him to a sparring match to test his determination, but it turns out that it was a ruse to get the two of them away from his wife and daughter to talk about the relationship between Mashiro's uncle and Miho Azuki's mother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em>, Issei crashes Rias and Raiser's marriage to take Rias back. Sirzechs then appears and tells him that if he wants his sister, he'll have to defeat Raiser. Naturally, Issei complies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">And he brought some stuff with him too.</a> The twist is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rias wants nothing to do with the marriage and her family are sympathetic but have their hands tied. Sirzechs backhandedly invited Issei to crash the party, and issued the challenge to give Rias a way out.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em>, Aoi's grandfather refuses to let her date anyone he doesn't consider worthy—generally, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">fighting them and evaluating their skills</a>. Oga is the only one he has ever acknowledged. Later, during the school trip, Oga wins a fight with the right to date Aoi as the prize. Oga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">seems completely unaware of the consequences of either of these events</a>, and Aoi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">too embarrassed to explain it</a>.
</li><li> Similarly to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> example, Chi-Chi does this to Goku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> after the two had grown up - granted, the contest was instead "Beat me and I'll tell you my name", but the engagement followed right on the heels of it.
<ul><li> Mr. Satan also freaks out when he realizes that Videl is in love with someone, saying that any boy who wants to date her would have to be capable of defeating him in combat (he's a long-running Martial Arts World Champion). Hilariously enough, Videl's boyfriend happens to be Gohan, who is one of the only teenage guys on the planet who could <em>easily</em> defeat Mr. Satan.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheCircumstancesLeadingToWaltrautesMarriage">The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage</a></em>, the Valkyrie Waltraute says she will only marry Jack if he can climb Yggdrasil all the way up to Asgard. She wasn't expecting him to actually try it, but he does. In a subversion, he ends up falling off halfway, but she catches him and declares him the winner because his determination moved her. They marry.
</li><li> An unusual version occurs in volumes 4-5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em>. The only three vampires of sufficient rank to be a socially acceptable match for Mina decide that they're tired of waiting for her to decide which of them she's going to marry (Despite being prepubescent and thus being ineligible for marriage to <em>anyone</em> at this time) and so they come up with and execute an Engagement Challenge <em>without her knowledge or consent</em>. Made worse by the fact that the challenge in question is to see which of them (Or rather, whose champion) is able to murder her closest friend. Fortunately, Akira kills two of them and subdues the third, winning Mina the right to order them back to their estates until she's ready to decide who she wishes to marry (Which, if she gets her way, won't be <em>any</em> of the Grand Dukes - she's despised them for centuries).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful">The World is Still Beautiful</a></em> does this twice in regards to Nike and Livius, interestingly enough since it's actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> that <em>was</em> initially approved by at least Nike's dad who is the leader of the Rain Dukedom:
<ul><li> To prove herself to the priest of Livi's kingdom, she must retrieve a ring from a deep crypt to prove herself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was a trap as there was no ring and the priest had men there ready to detain and kill Nike. Livi saved her and they got around the lack of formal ring with Everythings Better With Rainbows</span>.
</li><li> What gets foisted on Livius by Nike's grandmother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after the plan to hypnotize him into forgetting Nike fails</span>. Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Task</a>, given the ridiculous conditions he has to face — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finding the key to the tower where Nike is held from a muddy swamp, in the middle of a massive thunderstorm summoned by said grandmother. This means that, if he takes too long looking for the key, there's a chance he might drown due to the rising waters.

Beren accepts the task, but in a variation on the usual trope, his lover Lúthien is instrumental to the quest; she follows him, repeatedly saves his ass, and vanquishes his much more powerful foes. Not that Beren's a slouch — he's a badass who accomplishes quite a bit himself along the way.

<ul><li> As Elrond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">raised Aragorn</a> as a foster-son, it's pretty strongly implied that he badly wants to make sure that Aragorn fulfills his destiny, so he's also using the useful coincidence fate dealt him to do so. And unlike their mutual ancestors Beren and Lúthien, Aragorn and Arwen seem okay with the condition set on their marriage.

He won the contest that princes and sages had died in for centuries and went home, unaware that by winning Peven's Crown he had won the right to marry his best friend's sister, Princess Raederle "the second most beautiful woman in the Three portions of An". (Mildly subverted in that Raederle's father Mathom had second sight and knew who would win the game before he made the challenge. And even besides that, everyone who learns about his promise thinks it was literally the most stupid thing Mathom could possibly have done and doesn't hesitate to say so.)

The thing is, the reason the tournament is being held is the princes being there prevents the kingdom from being attacked until it's strong enough to discourage invasions by other means. Furthermore, the challenges are designed to be completely non-lethal and entirely relevant to ruling the kingdom, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> Princess Rose and her guardian are hoping that narrative causality will make sure that the winner ends up being someone Rose can love, as well as a good king. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It works, with Siegfried solving the final test by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">hiring dragons</a></em> to solve the biggest problem of the kingdom.</span>

However, since each individual challenge is set by the Marat woman in question the nature of the challenge can vary wildly based on the abilities of the prospective husband, and whether she wants to marry him or not. Tavi points out that, for example, if a woman from the Horse clan did not want to marry a man from the Wolf clan, she could challenge him to a horse race since he would stand no chance of winning. This way the Marat woman effectively exercises a complete marriage veto if she so chooses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the final book Kitai names her challenge to Tavi as killing the Vord Queen.

So at first, when three suitors come, he tells them to fight until only one remains (the survivor is left too badly disfigured to be worthy of a king's daughter). The next group is smarter, so the king's challenge is to make them draw one of two rocks from a jar - one is white, one is red, with the first one meaning the princess' hand, and the other being drowned in a river on the spot.

Her wizard father consented to the union and offered to make him human if he could pass his test, but the test was designed for humans, so He-Man was volunteered to be his substitute. He-Man had to enter a maze and retrieve a silver apple from a tree in the center. In the maze, his path gets blocked by a wall of fire, but He-Man realizes it is an illusion and continues. Then, he gets confronted by a beautiful woman who offers him the apple, but He-Man remembers the apple is on <em>the tree</em> and dismisses that illusion. The final obstacle was a centaur who demanded a test of strength. He-Man was unwilling to fight him, so he proposed a tug-of-war, which the centaur accepted and lost. On the way back, He-Man gets attacked by an evil wizard who wanted the girl for himself, but he quickly defeats him and returns with the apple to win the challenge.

A young man is told by the king that in order to marry the princess, he must successfully complete one task. The youth points out that this is unusual, as three tasks is the regular requirement.
<div class="indent"><strong>King</strong>: Well, since no one's ever come back from the first task, I've forgotten the other two.
</div><ul><li> That show had <em>at least</em> two other sketches poking fun at the trope. One in which the princess refuses to marry the frog-man who could leap to the top of the glass hill she was imprisoned on and ran off with the architect who built it, and one where the Cinderella type refused to marry the invisible prince despite being able to see him because he was even uglier than her stepsisters.

<ul><li> In early 19th-century Okinawa a woman named Yonamine Chiru insisted that any would-be-suitors had to best her at martial arts. She defeated everyone until Bushi Matsumura, one of the founders of modern karate and among the most fearsome fighters in Okinawan history, managed to narrowly defeat her and so won her hand.
</li><li> Khutulun, the great-grandaughter of Genghis Khan, was a fearsome warrior and wrestler; if any man wanted to marry her, he had to beat her, and if he lost, he had to give her a hundred horses. She ended up with ten thousand horses. And, in fact, she was <em>never</em> defeated in a wrestling competition—it was political pressure that got her. When rumors started that she didn't want a husband because she was sleeping with her father, she had to call off the challenge and pick a guy to dispel them.
