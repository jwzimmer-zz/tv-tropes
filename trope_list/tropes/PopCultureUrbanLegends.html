<p>It's not uncommon for false rumors to be spread about media.
</p><p>The dawn of the internet has not done much to quell urban legends. If anything, they've become easier to spread. It's not uncommon to see "he said, she said" rumors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episodes</a> that only aired once. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">God Never Said That</a> often over time leads to this, as a rumored quote will be circulated so much that it becomes an urban legend.
</p><p>Some say this is due to the "Mandela Effect", a pseudo-scientific theory that false memories are due to parallel dimensions colliding.

<ul><li> There was a widespread myth that the little kid from the Life Cereal commercials had died from trying out a deadly combination of Pop Rocks and Soda. As it turns out, no, the dude's still alive as of 2019. Plus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> proved that six 12-ounce cans of cola and six packages of Pop Rocks would only cause considerable pain to the subject (and even then, only if both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpospeakGag">gas release mechanisms</a> were blocked), as the reaction did not produce the amount of carbon dioxide necessary for stomach rupture.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cereal-killers/">rumors circulated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the star of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S6N_gQPYIM">a certain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> infamously cheesy Frosties commercial was dead. The first version claimed that he was severely bullied after the commercial aired, and said bullying either killed him directly or caused him to commit suicide. The second version is that he was <em>already</em> dead before the commercial was filmed, and his "appearance" in the commercial was actually a CGI construct, with his singing being pieces of existing voice clips from him assembled together to make the song, supposedly explaining the oddly flat and monotonous singing. In reality, he's still alive.
</li><li> Urban legend is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> was the original Gerber baby. The actual model was Ann Turner. Humphrey appeared as the model for a separate baby food called "Mellin's".
</li><li> When the famous "¡Yo quiero Taco Bell!" campaign ended in 2000, rumors circulated that it was because the chihuahua used in the commercials somehow died. In reality, the dog lived for nine years after the campaign ended. The truth is far more straightforward: the campaign simply wasn't profitable anymore.
</li><li> When the fast food chain "Kentucky Fried Chicken" rebranded to KFC, there were multiple reasons for this — wanting to downplay the word "fried" during a time of increasing health-consciousness, wanting to downplay the word "chicken" as their menu expanded to include other items, and a trend toward abbreviated names in general (International House of Pancakes changed its name to IHOP at about the same time). Rumors immediately spread that some more nefarious reasons were involved as well:
<ul><li> The state of Kentucky allegedly threatened to sue over the commercial use of its name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> actually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kfc-and-fried/">has a page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claiming this one is true... but it's filed under "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">The Repository of Lost Legends</a>" and has a link at the bottom explaining that it's a joke and you shouldn't just believe everything you read.
</li><li> The company was allegedly forced to stop calling the meat they serve "chicken" because it came from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kfc-mutant-chickens/">animals so genetically modified they could no longer legally be considered chickens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. KFC doesn't run its own chicken farms, so they'd have some difficulty pulling something like this off, even if they wanted to.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<h3><strong>Works</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The idea of a manga being outright forced to continue due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> is a common argument, especially concerning series from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a>, despite having virtually no evidence to this being the case outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">God Never Said That</a>.
</li><li> In the late '70s-early '80s, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UfoRoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UfoRoboGrendizer">Ufo Robo Grendizer</a></em> aired for the first time in Italy introducing the anime craze in the country, multiple magazines and newspapers spread around the weird concept that, since Japan was seen back then as a technology-heavy nation, their cartoons were made by a computer after scanning a few character sketches and a plot summary. The whole idea was already debunked in 1979 when Rai (the main Italian TV network, whose channels aired most of the anime shows available back then) aired a special news broadcast showing how animators at Toei worked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: A mistranslation of a chapter implied that All Might was in a relationship with his former sidekick Sir Nighteye (he literally states that he can't help Midoriya get an internship with him because they broke up, so it'd be awkward to ask, and Present Mic teases him about letting his feelings get in the way), which led many fans to believe and spread that All Might was interested in men. This was exacerbated when someone edited All Might's page on the wikia to add a false statement from Horikoshi in which he admits that All Might is interested in both men and women, but leaves his relationship with Nighteye ambiguous. While this was quickly cleared, some fans still believe in it.
</li><li> The unaired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro">Hamtaro</a></em> episode <em>The Warm Scarf-Capade</em> has remained a mystery for many years, and was eventually confirmed not to exist. Most likely it was either a misunderstood skip of the episode <em>Laura's Valentine</em> or a printing error.
</li><li> There's a rumor in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> fandom that in a manga omake, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirmed that Kagami has a one-sided crush on Konata (which of course is prime fuel for the shippers). Except... that this omake doesn't exist, but of course the shippers love to propagate the rumor without ever checking for a source. (The lack of scans online beyond the beginning of Volume 2 contributes to this.) An alternate version is that it was stated in an <em>interview</em> and the quote was more along the lines of "One of the girls has an unrequited crush on the other." but not it specifically being Kagami. Suffice to say, nobody ever managed to confirm this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>: Prince Uranus refers to a <a class="urllink" href="http://wikimoon.org/index.php?title=Prince_Uranus">fan-created rumor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (from the long-defunct fan site "Save our Sailors") that was stated to have come from an unnamed Japanese magazine's article interviewing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a>, who supposedly explained that Sailor Neptune's and Sailor Uranus's lesbian relationship was in fact that of Sailor Neptune and Prince Uranus, who had died and was reborn as a girl (as his sister's powers had passed on to him, causing him to be reborn as her). Needless to say, <em>Sailor Moon</em> fans were <em>not</em> amused, and the site that the rumor came from later quietly removed it.
</li><li> There is a popular and persistent rumor about the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> that stated that the whole series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, ending with Tsubasa waking up in a hospital, where we find out he was run over by a truck during the first episode and that his legs were amputated since the accident. While many people have stated that they "saw" the episode, this is in fact, false since there is nothing to prove it as real (besides a poorly photoshopped picture of Tsubasa in a hospital bed): there are three anime adaptations of the manga (the last one being Road to 2002), the scene with the truck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">is exclusive to the first series</a>, and the creator has been working in several sequels and spin-offs since the last anime was released in earlier 2000s. Even more: it was revealed in December 2017 that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh8czMsFjX0">a new anime series will be aired in 2018.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fandom has the still-persistent belief that Renamon was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">male in the original Japanese</a>. It doesn't help that at least one foreign version (the German one for example) has Renamon as a male character, which naturally caused confusion when one of its Digivolutions, Sakuyamon, was presented and it looked very feminine (including breasts, which Renamon didn't have).
</li><li> Additionally, a persistent rumor held that, in the Japanese version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Piedmon's Last Jest</a>, Takeru and Hikari kiss, a scene that was supposedly censored out for the English version. An even more persistent rumor held that the series was only supposed to run for a dozen or so episodes, consisting only of the Devimon arc, but its popularity caused it to be extended into a full 50-episode-long series.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gjwk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gjwk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gjwk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No official statement has ever been found to support this, and the way anime series are made and planned would make this course of events highly unlikely.</span> Yet another rumor claimed that the franchise's first movie, included as part one of the localized <em>Digimon: The Movie</em> was originally a stand-alone project whose good reception led to a full animated series being produced; the movie was actually shown at a film festival the day before <em>Adventure</em>'s first episode aired, making this impossible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> has had at least a couple of long-standing rumors about its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a>; one involves an interview where someone who worked on the show said that TK/Kari and Izzy/Mimi were going to be two of the couples, along with the canon Ken/Yolei and Matt/Sora. Another one, commonly perpetuated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Tai/Sora</a> fans, is that Sora and Matt are divorced. So far, there is no evidence that either rumor is true.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> has two rumors regarding the series finale:
<ul><li> Similar to the supposed ending of Captain Tsubasa, Doraemon was also believed to end like this. The whole show is (depending on who tells it) either the delusion of a mentally ill kid or more often, the dream of a boy in a coma. In both instances, Nobita is found bedridden with a Doraemon plushie and usually, the story claims that he has no legs. The story, however, does not end like that. The original TV show doesn't have a proper ending, in fact, it continued airing new episodes long after those rumors appeared, generally spread by older fans who grew out of Doraemon's main demographic and had no idea that the show was still making new material. The rumor is stronger in Latin America, fueled by the fact the dub had a hiatus that led people to believe the show ended. The manga never got a proper ending, while the anime has a special with a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a> style ending.
</li><li> Another rumor is way more optimistic. It deals with Doraemon malfunctioning as his batteries run out. The batteries are linked to his memory, and therefore replacing them will cause him to reboot. Nobita, not wanting to erase his memories, decides to study hard and do his best to find a way to repair his friend without rebooting his system. It leads to him becoming a successful engineer, and when he finally is able to fix the cosmic cat, Doraemon decides he no longer needs him and he decides to stay with Nobita's son instead. This rumor was created by a very convincing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">Doujinshi</a>, which has confused many people into believing it's the real deal, even when the original fan comic doesn't even pretend to be taken as canon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DragonBallAF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DragonBallAF">Dragon Ball AF</a></em> was a rumor started after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> ended, and still hasn't died. It's supposed to be a continuation of the story after <em>GT</em>, where Goku supposedly goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Super Saiyan 5</a>. It went downhill after that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/PoisonOakEpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/PoisonOakEpilepticTrees">Fan Theories are confirmed</a>, and every character reaches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">another level of Super Saiyan: 6, 7...50</a>. However, <em>AF</em> simply does not exist. Even the name is a mystery. The ones who want to believe it exists say it's "<strong>A</strong>fter <strong>F</strong>uture", the ones who don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">say</a> it's "<strong>A</strong>pril <strong>F</strong>ools". A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonBallAFToyble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonBallAFToyble">doujinshi</a> was created out of this theory by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toyotaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toyotaro">Toyble</a>, which just made things worse as the art is really good, and resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>'s. Some fans believed it to be official. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DaizenshuuEX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DaizenshuuEX">Daizenshuu EX</a> website also played with this theory, which again, just made things worse.
</li><li> Then there came <em>Dragon Ball</em> <strong>Hoshi</strong>, which just like <em>AF</em> doesn't exist. Yet trailers exist around the net, mostly scenes from <em>Dragon Ball</em> video game openings and movies unreleased outside Japan.
</li><li> And there's the age-old "Toriyama wanted <em>Dragon Ball</em> to end at &lt;insert arc here&gt;<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zilz');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zilz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zilz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Frieza and Android/Cell arcs are particularly common versions</span>" rumor, perpetuated by many fans yet rarely supported by factual evidence. In fact, the only original ending point per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was after the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> search — the very first arc!
</li><li> The people of the Hispanic <em>Dragon Ball</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> fell in love with this trope, due to using it whenever they could, well aware of the lack of effort from the fanbase about doing the research to prove them wrong. Examples of the rumors they've spread include the claim that Super Saiyan 3 Vegito could defeat Beerus according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Toriyama</a> and the "fact" that Android 17 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">won the Tournament of Power</span> because he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite">Creator's Favorite</a> (when in reality, he's not quite so high in standing), among other lies.
</li><li> A famous Hispanic <em>Dragon Ball</em> rumor involves people having memories of the Brazilian premiere of episode 245 was interrupted by news coverage of the September 11th attacks. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/9dfhjw/dragon_ball_z_and_911/e5hht5q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">A fan later revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that said episode was interrupted, but not on September 11th-the news report in question was about the US invasion of Iraq.
</li><li> <em>Dragon Ball</em> rumors are so notorious in Mexico in particular that Mexican fans started making up very tongue-in-cheek ones while <em>Super</em> was airing there. Among the most well known of these parodies are:
<ul><li> Gohan would learn how to use angel ki and unlock a new transformation called "Gohan Blanco", who would have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner">Pre Ass Kicking One Liner</a> "Esto Es El Fin".
</li><li> Jiren would turn out to have an older brother known as "El Hermano", who was generally depicted as a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Itachi Uchiha</a>.
</li><li> There would be a reveal of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> known as "El Padre Grande", who would turn out to be directly or indirectly responsible for virtually all of the bad things that happened in the multiverse in general and Universe 7 in particular through his manipulations of Lord Zeno.
</li></ul></li><li> The most famous factoids about anime in Hungary is that some kids got themselves killed by imitating <em>Dragon Ball</em> characters and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was banned as a result; the first part is flat-out false. <em>DBZ</em> was heavily scrutinized by out-of-touch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">media watchdogs</a>, but an official ban was never imposed. The show was merely cancelled after it was forced to air at midnight with a 18+ rating certificate. Since kids couldn't tune in anymore, the network removed it from their schedule, but the option to continue the broadcast was always open. Years later <em>DBZ</em> received a 16+ rating, but the network decided not to bother with it anymore. The ensuing media fiasco and the suicide threats of an angry teenage <em>DBZ</em> fan were widely publicized in press, which spread the false rumor of a ban and of kids killing themselves.
</li><li> Goku's scream as he activates Super Saiyan 3 caused his English voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanSchemmel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanSchemmel">Sean Schemmel</a> to pass out due to the strain. While Schemmel <em>did</em> pass out once during recording a Super Saiyan transformation, it was during the dubbing of <em>GT</em> and was mostly the result of overwork, not the result of the voice itself being difficult.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a widespread rumor that the reason the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf">Dragon Half</a></em> anime only got two episodes was because the animators were arrested for possession of drugs. This was the result of people taking a joke in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> literally. In reality, the reason was simply due to poor sales. (Two episode test runs were very common at the time, so this fate wasn't even uncommon.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the fanbase you'll sometimes hear the rumor that Winry's name was meant to be "Wendy", but it wasn't spelled correctly. Similarly, "Riza" was intended as "Liza" or "Lisa".
</li><li> Despite many fans swearing that it's canon, there is no mention anywhere in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a> that Envy's real name is "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">William Elric</span>".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early days of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> fandom, there were rumors that Ash's Butterfree dies in the original Japanese version of "Bye Bye Butterfree" and that the English dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">rewrote the script</a> so that Butterfree <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">lives</a>. It was supposedly claimed that Butterfree <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang">die after mating</a> like real butterflies do, and Ash is sad because he knows this is the last time he'll see his Butterfree alive. Once the Japanese episodes became more readily available, it became clear that this is not the case and Butterfree do indeed survive after mating. He even appears in a future intro with his mate.
</li><li> Rumors for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em> are that Mew in the Japanese version has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">very horrible opinion on clones</a> and says that they are "inferior and should die". In reality, according to Meowth (Nyarth in this version), its dialogue is:
<div class="indent"><em>The real ones are real. If the clones fight only using their bodies and not with skill, the real ones will never lose.</em>
</div></li><li> For a while after the Western release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou">Pokémon: I Choose You!</a></em> some voices (that were even here on this very site) said that in the Japanese version there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">post-credits scene</a> removed from the Western dubs featuring Giovanni and Mewtwo, hinting at a remake of the first movie being released in 2018. Reviews of the Japanese version such as <a class="urllink" href="http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/old_news_archive/july_2017.html">Dogasu's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> make clear that the only thing said at the end in the Japanese version was "the next movie will be released next year" in text form, with no extra scene whatsoever. It's unknown from where the rumor came from, but the remake movie did end up existing, due for a July 2019 release in Japan.
</li><li> Back before the episode was dubbed, there was a rumor that in "Gotta Catch Ya Later!", Ash gives Misty his hat as a keepsake. This even appeared in fan-magazines and guides. Other rumors exist that the scene was cut by 4kids but exists in the Japanese version.
</li><li> In the 2000s there was a rumor of a Japanese-only episode where Pikachu was confirmed to be female by turning into a human girl. No such episode exists and Ash's Pikachu was later confirmed to be male.
</li><li> Back when the "Black and White" series was airing, there was a rumor about possibly replacing Ash with a new protagonist by the end of the <em>Diamond and Pearl</em> series. Likely like the Indigo example, this would have led him to win Sinnoh. It's also likely why Tobias, the trainer who beat Ash in Sinnoh, came out as he did: it was likely decided after they had written the Ash vs Paul battle and the writers realized they needed to knock out Ash so they could keep him going in Gen 5. However, no sources have been found that support this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">Various other languages have their own take on the myth</a>: the Italian version states that the writers didn't know how to give the new protagonist a Pikachu; the French and Spanish versions claim that Ash won a poll to stay on as the protagonist instead of being replaced; the German version simply states that the writers didn't have any ideas; and the Portuguese version claims that the staff feared the new protagonist would end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a>.
</li><li> There is a rumor that the Iron-Masked Marauder from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon4Ever">Pokémon 4Ever</a></em> is Jessie and James' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a> in the Japanese version, but it isn't true. This comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">several summaries</a> (including Netflix's for a while) having incorrectly called him their descendant.
</li><li> "The Breeding Center Secret" was rumored to be different in the Japanese version, as James says that he stole the Weepinbell that appears, but this is false. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">It's never explained how he got it until Johto</a>.
</li><li> There's a myth that someone on the writing staff, or the Japanese version of the anime, revealed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> between Professor Ivy and Brock. What it is differs, but the most commonly spouted one is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">Ivy's lesbian</a>.
</li><li> There's an rumor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Brock</a> was replaced with Tracey because the team wanted a more "white" character to appeal to international fans. Not only is it unsourced but Tracey's Japanese name being Japanese implies he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki">same ethnicity as Ash and Brock</a>.
</li><li> A very persistent rumor circulated for years, particularly amongst Spanish-speaking circles, that Ash has been aging for years in the original Japanese dub and his infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">Not Allowed to Grow Up</a> status is the result of dub changes. As anyone who has watched the series in Japanese knows, this is not true.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a rumor that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> was originally supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">Yaoi</a>, but was changed to attract a wider audience, which some say is just an urban legend. There is evidence for both arguments, with the strongest evidence for the rumor being that the author has been known to draw Yaoi before.
</li><li> A weird edit on the Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> page for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em> mentioned an enormous quantity of side characters that were apparently edited out from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> dub, including multiple appearances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand2">Gooey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand3">Bukiset</a> respectively as Kirby's sidekick and Knuckle Joe's rival, an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> about a penguin army declaring war on Dream Land and a pair of sword-wielding fairies, with detailed descriptions of where they supposedly appear in every single episode of the show. The fact that none of the descriptions actually match with any scene saw in the series can easily prove that was a giant lie.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPrincessMinkyMomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPrincessMinkyMomo">Magical Princess Minky Momo</a></em> anime has been associated with the occurrence of earthquakes in Japan. When episode 46 first aired, an earthquake warning appeared on screen at one point. The final episode then aired on the same day as the Sea of Japan earthquake. 12 years later, the final episode re-aired at the same time the Great Hanshin Earthquake struck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: There's a persistent rumor that Naruto/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura</span> was the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">endgame couple</a> and that Kishimoto only paired with him with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata</span> due to it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a>. No, Kishimoto always planned <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata</span> as Naruto's love interest and admits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Narusaku</span> was all just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a>.
</li><li> The visuals for the opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiShitenight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiShitenight">Ai Shitenight</a></em> showed the main character Yakko with blonde hair (which is her hair color in the manga), instead of the brown she actually has in the anime. Because of that, in Italy for years a rumor was spread that the "mysterious blonde girl" seen during the theme song was the host of a brief segment that originally aired at the end of every episode where she basically gave sexual education lessons at the kids watching the show which were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">entirely cut in the Italian dub</a>, including explanations on which scenes in each episode were used as basis for the lessons. But years later the truth actually came out. It should be noted that the Italian dub had its own opening, which combined both scenes from the actual episodes and parts of the original opening sequence, which probably confused the Italian viewers and led to this rumor.
</li><li> Among Spanish fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>, there was the rumored third season "Pichi Pichi Pitch Magical'' which was going to introduce a red mermaid princess named "Cora Izumi", as well as a dark blue mermaid princess named "Reiko Minami". None of this information was confirmed real and the anime doesn't have a third season.
</li><li> Among Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a>, a popular rumor exists purporting that a supposed alternate ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em> was once broadcast during one of the film's annual airings on Japanese TV; the rumor started from a number of low-quality screenshots posted online in 2007, all of which contained shots not seen in the final film and some of which include credits superimposed onto them. While Ghibli themselves debunked the claim that an alternate ending exists, a number of fans are still trying to prove that it exists by hunting down TV airings without any publicly available home recordings, with one even offering ¥50,000 to anyone who can find footage of the alleged alternate ending alone and ¥70,000 to anyone who can find a full recording of a broadcast containing the ending, with commercial breaks intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em>: There was a rumor in France that episode 35 was broadcast only once during the show's first French airing in 1990 and that it was edited so severely due to its content that it was about 15 minutes long. While some TV programmes did announce said episode, it was actually skipped and the next episode was aired in its place. It wasn't properly dubbed in French until 2006 for DVD with a different cast (save for Madoka and Hikaru).
</li></ul><h3><strong>English/Foreign dubs</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Prior to information on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">Ocean</a> pilot dub of the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em> being revealed, there were rumors of a dub of the anime by Cloverway that dubbed and aired two seasons (even more episodes dubbed than the 4Kids dub) in Australia before being banned for the "sexual content" that occured in later seasons.
</li><li> There was once a rumor floating around that the Canadian company Nelvana dubbed the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump">Doctor Slump</a></em> anime for Canadian distribution, but was never released and fell into obscurity. There were also various Wikipedia pages of some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a> actors that mentioned "Dr. Slump" on thier filmography, which might've meant that the supposed Nelvana dub might've had a voice cast from Vancouver, just like Nelvana's dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptors</a></em>. It is unknown if this dub rumor is true or not.
</li><li> There were also rumors floating around of an Ocean pilot dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> called "Conan's Capers" that edited and merged the first three episodes into one and was heavily edited to remove violence.
</li><li> According to a forum post on Lost Media Wiki, he mentioned an obscure US English dub of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket">Lupin III (Green Jacket)</a> that was titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">The Viper</a>" and it aired in 1972, one year after the anime aired in Japan. Not much is known about this dub since the mention is recent, but there is very little proof of its existence as of now, so it is currently unknown if this dub is true or false.
</li><li> Officially, the Italian dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> removed the special ending credits from the last episode (which feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> of all the key moments from the franchise) and used the regular ending credits as every other episode. For years a rumor floated that a single rerun of the show in early 2007 actually used those credits, with the original theme song replaced with the Italian one and the addition of extended Italian dub credits listing the voice actor for every single character from the show's three series. The only proof of these credits existing was the thumbnail of a Youtube video that allegedly featured a recording of them that has been removed since a long ago. After years of research, in early 2020 it was finally revealed that the video was only a fanmade AMV, with the main revealing point being that the credits were wrote using the font used for the credits of the first dub of the <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> movies, made by a different company than the show's dub.
<ul><li> Similarity, a few users in the comments in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yFRBozAfDw">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mentioned that they recalled that the song used in this Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a> commercial was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">the actual closing theme song of the Junior TV airings of the Mediaset dub of the anime when it reran</a>. Unfortunately, no other proof that this song was the theme song exists to this day, so it is unknown if this is true.
</li></ul></li><li> Prior to the dub of the franchise distributed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WildBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WildBrain">WildBrain</a> being announced, IMDB listed an English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShimaShimaToraNoShimajiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShimaShimaToraNoShimajiro">Shimajiro and the Rainbow Oasis</a></em> that used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySoManyCanadianActors">a Canadian cast</a>. If one were to look at the roles, they are false: half appear to be mixed up with a Korean film called <em>The Thieves</em>, while the other half is the cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters">Moshi Monsters</a></em>.
</li><li> It was rumored that an English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> called <em>The Adventures of Albert and Sydney</em> aired in Barbados.

Both dubs were released/made in unknown years and they fell into obscurity after their releases, and the user might've heard about the dubs from somewhere or seen one of them, but there's no more info on those dubs to this day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: There is a PSA known by fans as the "<em>Evangelion</em> AIDS PSA", which allegedly featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeSpencer">Spike Spencer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant">Tiffany Grant</a> voicing Shinji and Asuka having sex. The PSA does indeed exist— it was intended to air on Texas radio in the 1990's, only to be banned due to the voice work sounding too realistic— but it had no overt connections to <em>Evangelion</em> outside of Spencer and Grant reusing their Shinji and Asuka voices; it actually consisted simply of two unnamed teenagers having sex while a narrator notes that one is killing the other by inadvertently spreading HIV. The belief that the PSA had anything to do with <em>Evangelion</em> came from Grant jokingly describing it as Shinji and Asuka having sex (in reference to the aforementioned reused voices), which fans misinterpreted as the PSA being officially sanctioned by ADV and Gainax.</li></ul></div>

<ul><li> There's a legend among London architecture enthusiasts that George Gilbert Scott's St Pancras station was simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript">carbon copy</a> of his original design for the Foreign Office building in Whitehall, rejected for being too Gothic. Examination of the actual Foreign Office proposal shows that this is a complete urban legend (possibly originating as a joke).
</li><li> A common story in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormonism</a> is that, as proof of Brigham Young's prophetic skills, he included mysterious empty shafts in the design of the Salt Lake Temple, that, decades later, proved to be the exact proportions needed for an elevator system. In fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ldsliving.com/Debunking-the-Salt-Lake-Temple-Elevator-Myth/s/84121">elevators existed in the 1850s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, when construction of the temple began, and the earliest inclusion of shafts in the temple's blueprints specifically designated them for elevators.
</li><li> In 1967, London's original famous "London Bridge" was sold and rebuilt in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. It's widely believed that the man who bought the bridge, Robert P. McCulloch, had purchased it thinking he was getting the far more iconic Tower Bridge, and therefore got ripped off. This was merely a comical rumour and was repeatedly stated to be untrue by McColluch and the bridge seller Ivan Luckin after it started to spread.

This seems to have spun out from a story from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> where a municipal government or a board for/of youths decided to stop their order of the comic due to their poor financial situation. They had joked that the reason was because of Donald not wearing pants, but that's all it was: a joke. One that got picked up by some foreign (as in not-Finnish) newspapers as fact and it continues to spread from there.
</li><li> Due to entries on this wiki, there's the rumor that Tekno and Amy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">confirmed as a couple</a> at a convention. No such confirmation exists. In 2018, however, Nigel Kitching wrote a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SonicTheComicOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SonicTheComicOnline">Sonic the Comic  Online!</a></em> issue that casually mentions Tekno and Amy as a couple in the distant future.

<ul><li> One post posits that while the comic ended mostly the same, but that <em>Secret Empire</em> was meant to mirror <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> with the World Security Council (a group introduced over in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> and brought over in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaSteveRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmericaSteveRogers">Captain America: Steve Rogers</a></em>) would have taken over, proceeding to clamp down on super-heroics, mimicking the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a></em> era. Many of the fallen elder heroes would have returned via <em>Generations</em> and would go on a trip to reconnect with the people while the younger heroes would lead the fight against the WSC. These titles would also be converted into a brand new Ultimate line — Miles Morales' <em>Spider-Man</em> title would go back to <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>, <em>All-New X-Men</em>/<em>X-Men: Blue</em> would become <em>Ultimate X-Men</em>, <em>Champions</em> into <em>The Ultimates</em>, etc.
</li><li> Another post posits a quite different ending and follow up. This post would claim that <em>Secret Empire</em> was originally planned to end with Sam Wilson becoming Captain America once and for all, defeating an unrepentant Steve Rogers. With many of the previous heroes either dead or disgraced in some way, the legacy characters would have fallen into the spotlight. It's claimed that the immense backlash against HYDRA!Steve lead to a hastily re-written ending to how it is now, which holds credence in that the story has a plotline involving another Steve Rogers trapped in Kobik's mind that doesn't connect with the main story until the very end and the hastily thrown in hook to <em>Generations</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a long-standing rumor that Gwen Stacy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHisSled">never died</a> in the Mexican version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>, and Peter married <em>her</em> instead of Mary Jane Watson. For context: in the early days of the comic, the publishing company La Prensa got permission to publish Spanish translations of <em>Spider-Man</em> comics in Mexico; the comics proved to be such a hit with Mexican audiences that they eventually started publishing <em>two</em> comics per month instead of one, and eventually overtook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>' publishing schedule. Because of this, Marvel gave Mexican artist Jose Luis Duran permission to draw his own original <em>Spider-Man</em> stories, and even gave him full creative control. And in one of these original stories, Peter and Gwen got married, even though "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNightGwenStacyDied">The Night Gwen Stacy Died</a>" had already been published by that point. Contrary to rumor, though, that story was revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, and its events were never intended to be canon.
</li><li> It's long been claimed in certain places that, during the Golden and Silver Ages of American comics, major companies banned the use of the word "flick" or the name "Clint", due to fears of what would happen if, due to the poor quality of the paper and printing methods, the "L" and the "I" in either word got blurred together and looked like a "U". There's no evidence of this happening (for a start, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>, who debuted for Marvel in the Silver Age, has always had the legal name Clint Barton), but it inspired the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a>'s comics magazine CLiNT.

The strip widely circulated online is a parody created by someone to make an anti-medication point, though the actual artist is unknown. The actual final strip adopts an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a> perspective.

It involves a screenshot of a scene showing that Boo drew a drawing of her mother and "Uncle Roger" having sex. The picture is photoshopped.

</li><li> For a long time, it was believed, even by the users on this wiki, that since the newscaster moose in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> was changed to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">different animal in other foreign versions</a>, the UK version made him a corgi. Many were skeptical, since screencaps of the other animals existed online, but not the corgi, and there was no evidence of domestic dogs or cats in the <em>Zootopia</em> world. Eventually, web users who were actually from the UK stepped in to correct this, pointing out he was still a moose in their version.
</li><li> Rumors exist that Disney modeled both the titular lead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em> and Tinker Bell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. These rumors are unfounded. Marilyn Monroe wasn't even a star when <em>Cinderella</em> was in production. The rumor likely spread because someone within Disney supposedly complained that Cinderella was "too voluptuous" and Monroe was a well-known celebrity from that era who was voluptuous.
</li><li> It's commonly cited that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said Lady from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em> was in heat during the film. The reason the strays attacked her is that they wanted to rape her, and Tramp got Lady pregnant during their night together. This, however, is not true. Disney has never mentioned Lady being in heat and Lady's pregnancy would have lasted too long for a dog if Tramp got her pregnant that night.
</li><li> There's an urban legend for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet">Treasure Planet</a></em> that the original theatrical version contained a shot of Amelia looking down on her blood-covered hand after being injured, but it was considered too graphic and was censored upon home release. No proof of this scene exists. In the final film, Amelia does get injured, but there's no blood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>: There is a rumor online that Disney tried to make Tiana <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">But Not Too Black</a> by keeping her curly hair tied up. The assumed concept art is actually fan-art by a French artist on what he imagined Tiana could look like.
</li><li> There's a common claim that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King (1994)</a></em> started life as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em> remake, but they were declined the rights and instead opted to "ripoff" the series. There's no proof of such an agreement ever being attempted. Concept art of a white cub exists, but it is from the <em>King of the Jungle</em> stage of development where none of the <em>Kimba</em> similarities existed. It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewBroderick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewBroderick">Matthew Broderick</a> agreed to be in the movie expressly <em>because</em> he thought it was a <em>Kimba</em> adaptation.

Anybody who's ever watched both can tell you that the only things they have in common is being about talking animals in Africa and the names of the main protagonists.
</li></ul></li><li> It's commonly claimed that Disney lost the rights to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan">Tarzan</a></em>, hence why they no longer make merchandise of it. Disney still owns the rights to the film (plus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan">the original character</a> is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter">public domain</a> in selected territories, so it'd be very difficult for the estate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> to take the rights back); more likely the reason there isn't any merchandise of it is simply because the film isn't very popular compared to the rest of the Disney Renaissance.

It was supposedly made in 1947 and starred famous Polish actors Jadwiga Smosarska and Adolf Dymsza as Snow White and the Prince. This was proven untrue as Smosarska moved to USA soon after World War II broke out and only came to Poland in 1958, while Dymsza was banned from acting in Warsaw for five years after the war ended. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18ai6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18ai6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18ai6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">according to the article on polski-dubbing.pl</span> In reality, no other Polish dub other than the 1938 one was made until 2009.
</li><li> Many claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> hated cats, due to them being featured as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">monstrous antagonists</a> in films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">An American Tail</a></em>. In fact, during production of <em>NIMH</em>, Bluth had a <a class="urllink" href="http://dragonslairthemovie.com/who-is-missy-the-cel-painter/">pet cat named Missy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who was brought to the studio while suffering from cancer so the crew could spend time with her. She passed away before the film was finished, and was even credited as a cel painter, showing that Bluth did care for her greatly. It's more likely the reason those films had antagonist cat characters is due to them starring mice, and cats being the natural enemy of mice in fiction.
</li><li> There's a debunked rumor that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenII">Frozen II</a></em> originally ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elsa staying dead, instead of her undergoing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>,</span> and the ending was only edited within a year of release. In actuality, the ending was one of the first things decided, a fact that's been repeatedly confirmed both after the movie's release and well before it.

<ul><li> It appears that Jack Lemmon and Matthew Broderick have acted together in the 1993 TV film adaption of "A Life in the Theater", which aired on TNT back in October 1993, which makes this mystery even more mysterious, since it has been mentioned on the internet that Michael's first on-screen role was either the 1996 film "The Dentist" or the 1998 TV film "Gia", with no mention of "A Life in the Theater" anywhere in his filmography. Since there were other actors that starred in the film other than Lemmon and Broderick, it may be possible that Michael only had an unnoticable minor role.
<ul><li> The site also mentioned that Michael has worked with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman">Alan Rickman</a> before, but it is unknown if it's true or not, since there's no further evidence on this.

<ul><li> One of the most famous legends concerning the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em> franchise is that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> supposedly had a scene, which was only shown on the opening day of its release, which showed Ellen Ripley tying up her futuristic Reebok sneakers (in closeup, with the logo visible) in the Medlab just before the facehugger attack. For many years, fans swore up and down that this scene existed on different cuts of the film, to the point that one fan <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scified.com/news/aliens-the-mythical-reebok-shoes-scene">wrote an article specifically discussing the legends regarding the scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. No such scene has ever appeared in any cut of the film, and even then, close-ups of Ripley's Reebok shoes were already seen earlier in the film (such as the sequence where she straps herself into the Power Loader for the first time).
</li><li> There is an urban legend that the piglets used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe">Babe</a></em> all ended up sent to slaughterhouses after filming ended. In reality, they were retired to petting zoos and farms.

Unfortunately, the models didn't work well and they were never sold. This urban legend resurfaced in 2014 when a video was shown featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> demonstrating what seemed to be a real one. This video is also a hoax and was made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor">CollegeHumor</a>.
</li><li> It's widely reported that the planned third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> movie directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> was titled <em>Batman Triumphant</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> did plan another <em>Batman</em> film before the failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> and commissioned Mark Protosevich to write the screenplay, but it was actually titled <em>Batman Unchained</em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-begins-secret-history-movies-almost-got-made-802032">Protosevich isn't even sure where the title "Batman Triumphant" came from.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

It was in fact scripted, especially considering that it would be odd that an extra would hit a movie star with something and not get in trouble for it.
</li><li> The 1959 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur">Ben-Hur</a></em> is the single film most commonly accused of including real death, in its climactic chariot race scene. Three different sequences in which characters are run over by chariots have been pointed to as the real death, but all are visibly done with dummies. The earlier 1926 silent film version is subject to more serious claims of fatalities, with people who were present at the time alleging that at least one stunt performer was killed in an abortive attempt to film the chariot race scene in Rome, and that stunt performers may have drowned during the chaotic filming of a sea battle sequence. However, no sequences within the film have been identified as actually depicting death.
</li><li> There's a persistent rumor that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Big" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Big">Big</a></em> has an alternate ending where Susan shows up in Josh's class as a transfer student after using the Zoltar machine to de-age herself that was only seen on copies of the tape sold in New Zealand, despite Penny Marshall denying its existence. It doesn't help matters that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> called <em>14 Going On 30</em>, which came out around the same time as <em>Big</em> and had the same premise, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6783tkwbZw0">used a similar ending<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and that's probably what people are thinking of.
</li><li> It's often assumed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlueLamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlueLamp">The Blue Lamp</a></em>, which centres around a policeman being murdered by a juvenile delinquent in post-war London, was inspired by the real <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bentley_case">Craig and Bentley case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

A brief newspaper item suggesting this was simply a publicity plant to keep Reagan's name in the public view.
</li><li> Brandon Lee died on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em> from being hit by a dummy bullet shell. Rumor persists that the film originally contained his actual death scene. It doesn't. The film used a body double in scenes produced after his death.
</li><li> A popular internet joke/rumor is that there is an alternate version of the horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea">Deep Blue Sea</a></em>, which was supposedly only screened on Canadian television in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoughties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoughties">The Noughties</a>, that ran 22 minutes longer and had one of the stars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LLCoolJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LLCoolJ">LL Cool J</a>, rapping most of his lines instead of speaking them. While no such cut exists (its mention is a popular message board joke on Reddit), this urban legend does have some basis in reality. The original ending involved lead character Susan surviving the final shark attack, while Preacher (LL Cool J) died instead. After negative test screening feedback, director Renny Harlin and crew went back for a day to reshoot an alternate version of the scene (used in the final product) where Susan commits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to keep the shark from escaping, and Preacher manages to survive alongside Carter. Additionally, LL does rap — in the tie-in music video, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7HnCPz658s">"Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo">Fargo</a></em> is kind of an odd example, as there's technically two main rumors about it, although they're both somewhat the same rumor. The opening says that it's based on a true story, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this was just a joke, which could be an example in itself. A straighter example is the report of a Japanese woman who died trying to find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">buried money</a>. There <em>was</em> in fact a Japanese woman who died around the same area the movie takes place, but there's no evidence she was motivated by looking for the money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostwatch">Ghostwatch</a></em>: There have been allegations that prior to the broadcast, Sarah Greene performed an item promoting the film on the childrens' Saturday-morning entertainment show which she co-presented, <em>Going Live!</em>, which gave no hint that the programme would be fictional. This was seized upon by people who accused the BBC of an irresponsible hoax, but Greene denies it, and people have searched unsuccessfully through editions of the show that might have been involved without finding anything like it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em>
<ul><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954">Godzilla (1954)</a></em>, a persistent rumor is that the name "Gojira" was originally the nickname of a former employee of Toho. To date, no one living or deceased as ever come forward stating they (or someone they knew) was that person. In reality, Gojira is a combination of the words "Gorilla" and "Kujira" (Japanese for whale). This is because Toho originally planned for Godzilla to be a giant sea-dwelling ape (and later a giant octopus) before settling on a dinosaur. The name was kept for a very simple reason. Toho liked the way it sounded and felt it was a perfect name for a giant monster.
</li><li> Rumours abound that the name "Godzilla" was a way for American distributors to hide the fact that the film was Japanese. However, it was Toho who came up with the name Godzilla for international releases. The reason why? They felt audiences would have an easier time pronouncing "Godzilla" rather than "Gojira".
</li><li> For the record, no, Godzilla has never fought Gamera in a film. People often mistake the Magnetic Monster from the 1970s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGodzillaPowerHour">The Godzilla Power Hour</a></em> or Kamoebas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS">Godzilla Tokyo SOS</a></em> for Gamera due to them being giant turtles (the latter <em>was</em> a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards Gamera however). Funnily enough, Godzilla did face-off against Gamera in a stage show back in 1970. Alas, no video footage of this event has surfaced so far. A Gamera versus Godzilla movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">really was proposed</a> in the early 2000s, but it never got further than that before being rejected.
</li><li> It was rumored for a while that Little Godzilla was going to star in his own children's TV series. No such program was ever even considered by Toho.
</li><li> There are a lot of people who claim that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a></em> (1962) has two different endings for the American and Japanese releases, one where King Kong wins and one where Godzilla wins respectively. While there are differences between the two versions, the endings are the same and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that King Kong was always the intended victor. The rumor may have started because the Japanese version has King Kong's and Godzilla's roars played at the end, while the American version only had Kong's. People also may have assumed that American audiences didn't want to see an iconic American movie monster getting beat by an iconic <em>Japanese</em> movie monster, but this is also untrue; Godzilla was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">still portrayed as a villain</a> at that point in the series, so Japanese audiences fully expected him to lose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters">Destroy All Monsters</a></em> (1968): For a long time, it was thought that Baragon was originally going to be the one to destroy the Arc De Triumph in this film, but was replaced by Gorosaurus due to the suit being in bad condition. However, storyboard images show that Gorosaurus was going to be the one to attack Paris the whole time. While Baragon was briefly considered, he was scrapped. Not because the suit was in bad condition (the suit had been repaired sometime prior to filming) but because the suit's ears made it difficult to film Baragon emerging from underground. And in the first draft of the film (when it was known as <em>All Monsters Attack Directive</em>), the one who attacked was neither Baragon or Gorosaurus, but Maguma, but this was scrapped early on.
</li><li> There is also a common rumor about the German release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon">Godzilla vs. Megalon</a></em> (1973), namely that the dub claims that Jet Jaguar is King Kong wearing a robot suit — likely started by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe">James Rolfe</a>'s <em>Godzillathon</em> movie reviews. While it is true that some European releases of these movies have very wacky names, and in Germany, Jet Jaguar <em>is</em> really called King Kong, it's just a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>, and the character is never stated to be anything other than a human-built robot. For the record, Mechagodzilla is also renamed to King Kong in Germany, and this is, again, a simple name-change.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSMechagodzilla">Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla</a></em> (1974): A rumour stated that Anguirus replaced Baragon in this film due to Anguirus displaying traits commonly associated with Baragon (IE: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TunnelKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TunnelKing">burrowing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">great leaping ability</a>). This rumour was attributed to the poor quality of the suit because Baragon was never considered for the film and early drafts of the script clearly have Anguirus as the intended monster.
</li><li> An old and widely believed legend is that a movie titled <em>Godzilla vs. the Devil</em> was in development during the late 1970s. The story is oddly specific, detailing that the film was to be an American/Japanese co-production between Toho Company and UPA Productions in which Godzilla battles a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">giant spider</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster">giant fish</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">giant bird</a> before dueling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> himself. Not only did the film never come out, but it also doesn't even exist. The whole thing is just a very strange, very detailed rumor that originated in America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Script/Godzilla1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Script/Godzilla1994">Godzilla (1994)</a></em>: One legend associated with this planned 1994 US remake was that it would star an adult Junior. According to the myth, the original ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSMechagodzillaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSMechagodzillaII">Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II</a></em> (1993) was initially going to end with Godzilla performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> by exploding and pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> on Mechagodzilla. Junior was then said to grow into an adult Godzilla and head to America where the US films would start. In reality, no such idea was ever conceived by Toho, TriStar, or any film company at the time, though this proposed ending is <em>a little bit</em> like the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsDestoroyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsDestoroyah">Godzilla vs. Destoroyah</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em>:
<ul><li> This film has inspired rumours that this version was retroactively renamed "Zilla". While subsequent versions of the monster are now officially named "Zilla", the 1998 incarnation of the monster and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries">Godzilla: The Series</a></em> incarnations are still both officially named "Godzilla". The rumor likely spread after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars">Godzilla: Final Wars</a></em> featured the version of the monster named "Zilla" after director Ryuhei Kitamura stated that the monster "took the "God" out of Godzilla". For the record, while the monsters are of the same species, Godzilla '98 and Zilla are two separate individuals and that the 1998 film (and cartoon spin-off) exist in their own continuity.
</li><li> This film also inspired rumours that Toho absolutely hates the 1998 Godzilla. This, however, is untrue. While many people working for the company have expressed their own individual dislikes of the film (including suit actor <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenpachiroSatsuma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenpachiroSatsuma">Kenpachiro Satsuma</a> walking out of a screening of the film stating "It's not Godzilla"), the company as a whole's view towards Zilla has been neutral to fairly positive. Plus, given that the film was a box-office hit in its initial release and Toho continues to get royalties for every cable TV showing, DVD, Blu-Ray, or digital download purchase, it wouldn't make sense for them to hate something that makes them a profit.
</li><li> Another rumor inspired by this film is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriStarPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriStarPictures">TriStar Pictures</a> originally wanted to use King Ghidorah and Mothra, but were unable to due to Toho refusing to give them the rights to the monsters. In reality, Toho was perfectly willing to let TriStar use either monster but required separate licensing fees for each. Due to budget reasons, TriStar ultimately decided to have Godzilla (and his offspring) be the only monsters in the film.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars">Godzilla: Final Wars</a></em> (2004):
<ul><li> The rumour that this Godzilla is actually Junior. This rumor likely began due to the film's opening credits using the final scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSDestoroyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVSDestoroyah">Godzilla vs. Destoroyah</a></em> in which an adult Junior can be seen in silhouette. However, this was likely only used for dramatic effect. Likewise, another rumor states that the Final Wars Godzilla was originally going to be an adult Junior but the idea was scrapped during development. So far, there are no statements from Ryuhei Kitamura or any of the film's production team that neither confirm nor deny this claim. In fact, the Final Wars Godzilla is its own incarnation of the monster.
</li><li> Bagan was rumored to have been cut from the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars">Godzilla: Final Wars</a></em> and even had a video from 2012 claiming to be evidence. However, this was quickly debunked as the footage in question was actually from a show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChouSeiKantaiSazerX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChouSeiKantaiSazerX">Chou Sei Kantai Sazer X</a></em> and had absolutely nothing to do with the Godzilla franchise or any supposed cut footage of Bagan.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em> first came out, there were rumors of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">post-credits scene</a> exclusive to the Japanese release featuring Mothra. There never was any scene like that in any version of the movie, though Mothra does appear in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters">the sequel</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Grifter</em>, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>, is one of the most messed up films ever made that very few have ever seen. It does not exist, and is really just a creepypasta meme along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BenDrowned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BenDrowned">that haunted Zelda cartridge</a>, which also doesn't exist.
</li><li> Legends abound that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>'s filming was temporarily halted when the SPCA investigated issues revolving around the groundhog. A groundhog-related halt did occur, but it was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a> was bitten by the groundhog.

<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a> prank started a rumor that the snake freed in the zoo is Nagini, Voldemort's pet snake. From the looks of things, <em>thousands</em> of gullible fans have reblogged the quote.
</li><li> Also on Tumblr, there's a <em>very</em> highly reblogged post that appeared around the time the last movie premiered about the child actor playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Albus Severus</a> being the same one who played baby Harry in the first movie, despite the fact that a quick IMDb check shows that the first baby Harry was actually played by a set of triplets. Also, bonus points for using a picture of baby Harry from <em>Deathly Hallows</em> instead of the baby Harry from <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>.
</li><li> The long-standing contention that the filmmakers, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves">Steve Kloves</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidYates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidYates">David Yates</a>, favored the Harry/Hermione ship over the canon Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione ships. This comes from the perception that the films built up Harry and Hermione as a couple while portraying Ron as an idiot and Ginny as bland. Of course, the films ultimately end with the same pairings as the books, but did they really make those pairings look good? There's no real way to disprove this since it ultimately rests on a subjective reading of the films themselves, but you'd think the filmmakers would have better things to do than to subtly undermine the canon ships.

While the scene definitely was shot, there's a longstanding myth that it was removed from the film because test audiences found it too disturbing. In reality, the director cut it because he felt it ruined the film's pacing. The second myth is that the footage still exists somewhere in the world, possibly in Asia due to the possibility that the film was shipped there before the scene was cut, but so far, no luck.

</li></ul></li><li> Ever since the last known copy of <em>London After Midnight</em> was destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire, there has been a plethora of urban legends regarding film collectors who possess copies of it and refuse to share. Several different names have been thrown around, meaning that potentially <em>several</em> copies might be hidden away in private film vaults somewhere, but so far there's every indication that it's all just bored horror fans pulling the legs of other horror fans. This sort of thing isn't unheard of for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">lost films</a>, but <em>London After Midnight</em> attracts it to an unrivaled extent due to it being the most famous lost film there is.

<ul><li> The film series is one of several examples of action-heavy films which are subject to urban legends of incidents that led to the actual death of stunt artists being included in the finished film. The two incidents most commonly mentioned are the "bridge scene" near the end of the original <em>Mad Max</em>, in which Max drives the Interceptor through a group of the outlaw bikers, and one biker who hits the road can be clearly seen to be struck in the head by the wheel of a sliding bike; and a sequence in <em>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</em> where a biker hits an overturned dune buggy at speed and flies over the handlebars, over a buggy, and into a pit. Both of these were genuine accidents during filming that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">kept in for being spectacular</a>, but neither led to any permanent harm.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax1">Mad Max</a></em> also has a legend relating to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scenes</a> from the film that were supposedly included in certain early VHS releases and/or TV edits. Those most commonly mentioned include the bikers attacking Main Force Patrol headquarters and killing Fifi and all the other surviving cops (which would explain their absence from the final portion of the film), Max and Goose having a drag race, and Max looting the MFP HQ for weapons. However, no physical evidence of the alleged scenes has ever been produced. The <a class="urllink" href="https://madmaxmovies.com/mad-max/mad-max-cut-scenes/index.html">Mad Max Movies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> page discusses these more in detail; at least some of these scenes were at the very least scripted.

When online fans in the pre-DVD days bragged that their theater's print of the film had the UK-exclusive song "Super Heroes" intact, one fan attempted to top them by claiming that his theater had an otherwise lost scene in which Riff and Brad engage in anal sex. This became a long (LONG) running in-joke among the Rocky community, with two fans actually writing and filming an intentionally blurry version of the scene for the 2001 'Frankie Goes To Hollywood' convention. Currently, the scene circulates in a fan-created 'extended edition' in the film, strictly for the sake of keeping the legend alive, though it should never be considered canon.

<ul><li> An urban legend that has been circulating online for years is that there exists a scene within the Death Star where Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting against stormtroopers. They are trapped against a locked blast door as R2-D2 attempts to open it. The center of the room is a circular pit from which stormtroopers are seen falling in as they are shot trying to cross with the use of grappling hooks. The scene in question has never surfaced online or in any other media, except for Roger Ebert's "Microsoft Cinemania," a DOS-based multimedia CD-ROM movie encyclopedia, released in the early 1990s however evidence of this has never been produced and numerous people have tried searching the Microsoft Cinemania releases to no avail.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em>: Rumors have circulated for decades about a supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a> where Lex Luthor and his goons steal a piece of green Kryptonite from Addis Ababa. Understandable, since the editing of the movie makes it appear as if there is. Luthor and his cronies are shown discussing the idea of going there. The scene ends with them preparing for their trip. <em>The very next scene</em> takes place in a mountainous area of the United States where suddenly Luthor and his gang execute their hijack of the nuclear missile. This sudden narrative jump to this day has people wondering if there wasn't an entire sequence of events between the two sequences - i.e. the Addis Ababa caper, or at least a transitional scene involving Superman - that was filmed and cut. Not only has no evidence that such a scene was even planned ever been found, but the film seemed to suggest that Luthor and company didn't go to Addis Ababa after all, and that Luthor stole the Kryptonite from the Metropolis Museum. Remember: when Perry White was giving Clark a lecture on how he should be more aggressive, he mentions that the Museum was broken into and two security guards were killed - but all that was stolen was a piece of meteorite. The mistake lies in ignoring that neither Luthor nor his minions ever say that they're actually going to Addis Ababa. Otis does ask Luthor if they're going but there is no answer. Hence, the theft in Metropolis could mean that the Addis Ababa meteorite was acquired or borrowed by the Metropolis Museum, or that Luthor discovered that there was a different one with similar properties practically next door.

<ul><li> Legend has it that if you ask at SF conventions, you'll hear tales of some SF writer who created a book specifically to be as bad as possible. It turned out to be the exact opposite since an entire cult of people sprung up around it demanding more, so he said "why the fuck not!" and made a career on it. Depending on who you ask this person was either John Norman (author of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor">Gor</a></em> series) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a>. If this is true or not is unknown but it's a well-known enough story that at least one book featured it as a foreword, and if you search the internet you'll find discussions of who the alleged writer is. And before someone asks: no, it is not nor has it ever been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertEHoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertEHoward">Robert E. Howard</a> (Conan's creator), nor is it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. What sparse clues exist in the legend easily rule them out. General consensus <em>does</em> seem to point to Piers Anthony however, and his name comes up associated with it <em>a lot</em>. For the record, Piers has denied it ever happened and says that the series most usually associated with it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a>) came from a long-standing idea that he had of turning Florida (his home) into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">magical land</a>. Additionally, the first three Xanth novels were contracted as a trilogy (and are written as such, not stand-alone books), and only became a running series due to its surprise immense popularity.
</li><li> Many rumors surround the original abridged publication of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em>. The fact that it was nearly cut in half from the original manuscript (later restored in future printings) gave rise to the idea that the original draft had given King/his editor/president of Scribner horrific apocalyptic nightmares and they wanted the offending stuff excised, the government itself taking out stuff that too closely resembled their real-life plans of action for such an event, etc. In reality, King was still a fairly new author at the time, and his editors didn't feel the public would accept a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">Door Stopper</a> book from him. Once he was established as a mega-selling author, it was republished and restored (even then, King admits to editing some things out that he didn't like).
</li><li> The book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrapesOfWrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em> is said to have been translated in some countries as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">The Angry Raisins</a></em>. There is no evidence for this.
</li><li> It's widely believed that the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> utilizes giant spiders as villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> is that he was intensely arachnophobic after being bitten by a tarantula while playing outside as a toddler. While the incident with the tarantula did really take place, Tolkien later said that he had no memory of the event and did not dislike spiders at all, even going out of his way to avoid drowning ones that accidentally fell in his bathtub. The real reason he incorporated the villainous spiders is that his <em>son</em> was terrified of them.
</li><li> There is a bit of copypasta floating around the Internet claiming, among other things, that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann">E. T. A. Hoffmann</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNutcracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNutcracker">The Nutcracker</a></em> Marie lived in a loveless household, that she was depicted lying in a pool of her own blood after injuring herself, and that her parents punished her for it by locking her in her room until she admitted she'd been naughty. Only the second claim is true: Marie breaks the glass in the front of her doll cabinet and slices her arm open, and her mother finds her lying there surrounded by her dolls and passed out from loss of blood. Yet not only are her parents concerned for her health, but her worried parents confined her to her room solely because she needed to recover from such an injury, not to punish her.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39raj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note39raj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39raj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(It also could be confusing another scene, the battle between the Nutcracker and Mouse King is off-screen but when the Nutcracker returns depending on translation, it usually says that "the Mouse King has been bathed in his own blood.")</span>
</li><li> Take your pick: either Truman Capote was the real author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em> or Harper Lee was the real author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood">In Cold Blood</a></em>.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> One long-held game show rumor involves a word-guessing game being played by a celebrity and a contestant, with the word in question being "Deer". The celebrity (usually Alan Alda, though others have been credited) gives the clue of "Doe", and the contestant (usually an African-American or Southerner) answering "Knob." No record of this ever happening on any show has come up, and complicating things further is the inconsistency regarding exactly <em>what</em> show it's said to have happened on — some say <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em>, while others say it occurred on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark">Dick Clark</a>-hosted edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em>. What makes this unlikely to have happened on <em>Pyramid</em> is that the gameplay by design rarely called for one-word clues; furthermore, while Alda <em>did</em> compete on <em>Pyramid</em> a few times, there is no record of him having ever been on <em>Password</em>. Jamie Farr claims in his autobiography that it happened to him on a 1984 episode of <em>Super Password</em>, but 1.) his episodes have rerun many times and none of them show this happening, and 2.) the legend was already in circulation by this point.
</li><li> A famous clothing designer (most often Liz Claiborne or Calvin Klein, more recently whoever is the hot clothing designer) went on Oprah (in the older incarnations, Phil Donahue) and said their clothes weren't designed to be worn by (insert ethnic group here, usually large African-American women).
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> There's one about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho">El Chavo del ocho</a></em>, very popular on YouTube, about how the original show ends with the eponymous Chavo dead after he gets hit by a car. This is totally false; the original run ended with the trip to Acapulco three-parter. "Street child killed by car" does happen in the companion book <em>El Diario del Chavo del Ocho</em>, although to a friend of el Chavo, and before the events of the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has a few:
<ul><li> There's a long-standing legend that the original TARDIS police box prop was previously used in an episode or episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DixonOfDockGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DixonOfDockGreen">Dixon of Dock Green</a></em>. In fact, it was built new for the show.
</li><li> 1960s <em>Doctor Who</em> in colour. Various rumours have circulated about parts of or entire episodes of Hartnell and Troughton stories being made in colour as unbroadcast technical experiments. This never happened. The probable source of the rumour lies with unofficial colour films of location shooting for a couple of sixties stories, which were made by crew members or fans.
</li><li> A persistent rumour is that the first season (or seasons) were broadcast live. It wasn't. It was recorded "as live" before broadcast. (Although many other early BBC productions <em>were</em> broadcast live, most notably the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheQuatermassExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheQuatermassExperiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a></em>, and in subsequent interviews some cast and crew members claimed <em>Who</em> was originally broadcast live, likely mixing it up with other shows they worked on.)
</li><li> The "missing sixth episode" of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E5TheDaemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E5TheDaemons">"The Dæmons"</a>, set off by an April Fool's prank in a fanzine. The somewhat abrupt and ill-explained ending of the story, combined with its unusual length of five episodes, led to a fan rumour that it was made as a six-part story and then had the last two episodes crudely edited into one. This had happened a couple of times earlier in the show, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E1PlanetOfGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E1PlanetOfGiants">"Planet of Giants"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators">"The Dominators"</a>, but "The Dæmons" was written as broadcast.
</li><li> There were several wild rumours involving the true authorship of the stories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda">"Kinda"</a> and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E2Snakedance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E2Snakedance">Snakedance</a>", due to the unusually cerebral nature of the scripts and the fact that the writer, Christopher Bailey, didn't write very much else and quickly gave up scriptwriting for academia. It was commonly alleged in fandom that "Bailey" was a pseudonym for a very well-known person who didn't want to be known as a <em>Who</em> writer, with the most common targets being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush">Kate Bush</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomStoppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomStoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>.
</li><li> There was a fan rumour that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E4Terminus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20E4Terminus">Terminus</a>" was supposed to feature the return of the Ice Warriors. These turned out to be false.
</li><li> Another old and now-discredited one is that in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E2VengeanceOnVaros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E2VengeanceOnVaros">Vengeance on Varos</a>", a story which has always been controversial for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">Family-Unfriendly Violence</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> nature of its setting, the Sixth Doctor deliberately pushes two mooks into an acid bath, causing them to suffer gruesome and agonising deaths. In an era before home video release or on-demand streaming, many fans "remembered" this as happening, but on viewing the scene anticipating the horrific events it is clear that one of the mooks accidentally falls into the vat while fighting the Doctor, and then pulls the second mook into it in panic. The Doctor does, however, make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondOneLiner">Bond One-Liner</a> immediately afterwards, something which would be out of character for any incarnation except the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroSubstitute">Anti-Hero Substitute</a> Six.
</li><li> A fan myth concerning "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E6TheDoctorsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E6TheDoctorsDaughter">The Doctor's Daughter</a>" states that incoming showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> learnt that the titular character, Jenny, was to be killed off at the end of the episode, and specifically requested that current showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> have her survive as he intended to use the character in the future. This is a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution">Gossip Evolution</a>: what actually happened was that Moffat made an offhand remark (after reading the script) that Davies had a habit of creating interesting characters then killing them off, and that prompted Davies to change his mind and have her come back to life at the end of the episode. When Moffat saw the episode go out, he was very surprised to find that Jenny now survived the episode, and was even more surprised to learn that he was the reason she did.
</li><li> But the most notorious urban legends in <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom surround <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episodes</a>, with wild tales of evil collectors or secret circles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">Big Name Fans</a> who own copies of missing episodes and refuse to release them to the wider public.
<ul><li> In November 2013, tabloids the <em>Daily Mail</em> and the <em>Mirror</em> reported as news that a copy of the seven episodes of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E4MarcoPolo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E4MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>", the earliest missing serial (and one of only three to have no existing footage whatsoever) had been found, recorded off-air by a handheld camera pointed at the TV screen. This was presumably a Chinese whisper based on the fact that many brief clips of footage have survived via this method  filmed by an anonymous Australian fan using an 8mm cine camera  but certainly not any full episodes.
</li><li> Ever since the rediscovery of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld">The Enemy of the World</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear">The Web of Fear</a>", the fandom has been plagued by the "omnirumour", which, promoted by some well-known American geek news sites, alleges that most or all of the 1960s Missing Episodes have actually been found, but that it's been kept secret because the people in possession of them want more money and/or because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> wants to keep a guaranteed home video income stream by "finding" them gradually over the next few decades.
</li><li> The "evil collector" legend actually achieved ostension in 2015, when the missing episode hunters who recovered the Nigerian copies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E5TheWebOfFear">"The Web of Fear"</a> revealed that Episode 3 of the story (one of the most sought-after of all Missing Episodes, since it features the first on-screen appearance of the iconic franchise character Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart) had been stolen between their discovery of the episodes and their official removal from their original location.
</li></ul></li><li> Difficult negotiations with the estate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryNation">Terry Nation</a> so the new series would be able to use the Daleks, combined with the species' relatively frequent appearances in the revival that averaged out at around once a year, led to the belief that the series was contractually obligated to have to use the Daleks at least once a year in order to keep the rights. This was debunked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> shortly before he left the position of showrunner, and it has been claimed that the real reason for the Daleks' much more frequent appearances in the new series is due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">Running the Asylum</a> and the species' iconic status as one of the Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">archenemies</a>.
</li><li> Fandom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> would have it that the Dalek that shoots the Doctor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth">"The Stolen Earth"</a>, nicknamed "Dalek Fred", didn't shout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">"EXTERMINATE!"</a> before doing so. Re-watching the episode reveals otherwise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: A persistent rumor claims that Rachel's sister Jill, introduced in season 6, was supposed to have a much longer arc that was cut short because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReeseWitherspoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReeseWitherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a> didn't get along. Aniston and Witherspoon have debunked this, stating that they were actually good friends and eventually worked together on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMorningShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMorningShow">The Morning Show</a></em>. Jill was only planned to appear in two episodes and while the producers were open to bringing her back Witherspoon couldn't fit any further appearances into her schedule.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em>:
<ul><li> Legend has it that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a> was offered the lead role of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em>. He wasn't even offered the role, as it wasn't common then for film actors to take on regular television roles (a one-shot guest appearance on an anthology series like <em>Playhouse 90</em> or <em>General Electric Theater</em> would be more typical). This may have sprung from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHVSCribt3U">a genuine promo Wayne made which aired immediately before the television premiere in 1955<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which featured an entirely different cast from the radio version, which had been running since 1952) in which Wayne says he wishes he <em>were</em> starring in <em>Gunsmoke</em> but instead the lead will be played by James Arness.
</li><li> In a more ridiculous example, one very strange legend claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a></em> guest-starred once. This is derived from a joke that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrentSpiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrentSpiner">Brent Spiner</a> made in an interview, riffing off the genuine time that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a> made a cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewlywedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewlywedGame">The Newlywed Game</a></em>. On a 1977 episode, Bob Eubanks asked "What's the weirdest place you've ever had the urge to make whoopie?" to Hank and Olga Perez. Hank said "on the freeway", prompting laughter and remarks from Bob. Olga, meanwhile, misunderstood the question and said "In the ass". Bob fiercely denied this ever happened, offered $10,000 to anyone who could prove it, and even had a T-shirt made (She Never Said "In the Butt, Bob!"), yet in the early 2000s somebody brought forth a videotape of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN">Game Show Network</a> rebroadcast of the episode and proved its existence once and for all, and Bob admitted defeat. Most likely Bob had had a hard time recalling the incident due to misremembered details told to him over the years — contrary to previously-held belief, the woman who said it was <em>not</em> black, did not speak with any kind of urban dialect, and did, in fact, say "in the ass", not "in the butt", with the offending word censored. The episode itself had been rerun on Game Show Network several times before, and the uncensored master tape appeared in the 2002 film <em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em>, based on the "autobiography" written by the show's producer, Chuck Barris.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:

</li><li> Due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">loose ends</a> from the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em>, there's been some speculation about what happened in the events leading up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>. One of the most prominent rumors is about a series of shorts called "Scorpion Rain", made using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheShelfFX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheShelfFX">various Power Rangers toys</a> to promote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurboAPowerRangersMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurboAPowerRangersMovie">Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie</a></em> in Australia.

</li></ul></li><li> There are MANY urban legends and rumors about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>. The Muppet Wiki even has an <a class="urllink" href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rumors">entire category about them.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Many are also on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Snopes">Snopes</a></em> and some of the popular ones include an episode where Ernie dies, an episode where Bert and Ernie get married, and Cookie Monster being changed to the Veggie Monster, all of which are false. The rumor about a Muppet character appearing that is HIV-positive is actually true. She does, however, only appear on the South African version of the show, where AIDS is a large problem.
</li><li> One of the most persistent urban legends about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> is that Tom Paris is just a slightly tweaked version of Nick Locarno from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E19TheFirstDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E19TheFirstDuty">The First Duty</a>" and that they made the changes to avoid paying royalties to the writers of that episode. This was mostly a result of Robert Duncan McNeill, who played Locarno in TNG, being cast as Paris. The truth is that while the character of Tom Paris was based on Locarno the producers of <em>Voyager</em> felt Locarno's character was "irredeemable", and McNeill only read for the part after several other auditions failed to find someone who met the criteria they were looking for.
</li><li> It's commonly assumed by <em>Star Trek</em> fans that the instrumental "Archer's Theme" was originally written to be the opening credits theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> but was replaced by the Russell Watson cover "Where My Heart Will Take Me". Fairly plausible, as it syncs up with the opening credits perfectly, and a variation plays over the closing credits, but not actually true. According to composer Dennis McCarthy, he created "Archer's Theme" at a fairly late stage, and actually wrote it to match the opening credits rather than the other way around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rumors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZsaZsaGabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZsaZsaGabor">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a> (sometimes another famous actress) appearing on the show sometimes have her bring a cat, which sits in her lap during the interview. The actress would ask if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson">Johnny Carson</a> wanted to pet her pussy. "Yeah, just move the damn cat!" Carson himself officially disclaimed this rumor when it was asked of him on his show by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneFonda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneFonda">Jane Fonda</a> (in Carson's words: "I think I would <em>remember</em> that!") Both Carson and Gabor sent written correspondence to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> denying the incident ever happened. (Weirdly, there <em>is</em> photographic evidence of Gabor bringing a pet onto the set of <em>The Tonight Show</em> with her, however unlikely that may seem — but it was a <em>dog</em>, not a cat.)
</li><li> Another is the wife of a famous golfer (almost always Arnold Palmer) talking about kissing her husband's (golf) balls before games for good luck. "I'll bet that gets his putter up!"
</li><li> A long-standing rumor among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> fans holds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, when asked by Carson what it was like to be the world's greatest guitarist, said "I don't know, you'll have to ask Phil Keaggy". Technically this one can't be definitely disproven because Hendrix died in 1970, before <em>The Tonight Show</em> stopped wiping episodes. But he is known to have appeared on the show once, on July 10, 1969, though Carson wasn't hosting that night (Flip Wilson was guest-hosting). Therefore <em>Carson</em> couldn't have asked him the question, which already makes the legend highly suspect. A surviving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone">Rolling Stone</a></em> article discussing Hendrix's appearance makes no mention of the Keaggy shout-out either, though it does go out of its way to berate Wilson for some bizarre antics involving banging a watermelon on his desk, so presumably if Hendrix had said anything so interesting it would have caught their attention.
</li></ul></li><li> Long-rumored legend in the industry that Adam Carolla was fired/got rejected by producers to be the host of the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> (usually in conjunction with something racist/sexist/homophobic he supposedly said). In reality, he was offered the job (or at least an audition) and turned it down because he was working on a separate TV project and didn't have the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouBetYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouBetYourLife">You Bet Your Life</a></em>: It's widely believed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrouchoMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrouchoMarx">Groucho Marx</a> responded to a woman saying she had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">lots of children</a> because she loved her husband with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">I love my cigar, too, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while</a>". But this risqué remark would never have been allowed on TV during the time period when the show aired, and Groucho himself stated in an interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">he never actually said it</a>.
</li><li> There have been numerous people who have memories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettyWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettyWhite">Betty White</a> dying in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, and all television stations carrying news suspending their regular programming for a week to cover her life story. Part of this confusion may stem from a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/showbiz/betty-white-not-dead/index.html">hoax news article circulating in 2014<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a> referring to her use of hair dye.
</li><li> Some people remember an opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">Walt Disney Presents</a></em> where Tinker Bell flies around the castle and uses her wand to dot the "I" in Disney's name, while others claim that this sequence was used on several VHS tapes of Disney movies.
</li><li> There was a rumor of this type concerning the Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RomperRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RomperRoom">Romper Room</a></em>: allegedly, in one episode, Miss Midori, the show's host, asked the children if they knew any words beginning with the Japanese letter "ki", and a boy responded with "I know: <em>kintama</em>!", which is Japanese slang for testicles. Miss Midori then asked the boy if he could think of something a bit more <em>kireina</em> ("nice" in Japanese), prompting the boy to respond with "Kireina kintama!" ("Nice nuts!"). After cutting to a commercial break, the boy was replaced with a teddy bear.
</li><li> Until the episode was found in 2020, many people remembered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the shop closing down for good</span>. In the actual episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that isn't the case</span>.
</li><li> For years, rumors circulated online of an unaired episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego">Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego</a></em> called "Auld Lang Gone," which featured the winning contestant breaking her arm during the bonus round, and the runner-up having to finish it on her behalf. Other things apparently went wrong as well, such as Rockapella member Sean Altman ripping Greg's jacket, the Plastic Diver Guy's tank breaking, and Greg taking over the Chief's role until the office sketch ended because Lynne Thigpen had a sore throat, prompting Marc Summers to take over his hosting role for the rest of the episode. It also allegedly contained an appearance from Gene Wilder. However, in 2020, BuzzerBlog contributor Christian Carrion researched the episodes existence, and after talking to archivists at WQED and WGBH, creator Howard Blumenthal, and Summers, concluded that the episode never happened and wasn't real.
</li><li> The Italian TV show for kids <em>La Melevisione</em> (which, for non-Italian readers, can be described as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></em>-like show with a fairytale setting) had a few urban legends around it.
<ul><li> One of the biggest ones focused around the replacement of the main host from Tonio Cartonio to Milo Cotogno. Most rumors stated that Danilo Bertazzi, the actor who played Tonio, was either kicked out from the show because he was gay (similarly to what happened to David Yost during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em>) or was sent to rehab because he frequently used drugs behind the scenes and died shortly after. Both those versions was disproven: Danilo still appeared in a few other shows (including <em>Trebisonda</em>, basically an equivalent of <em>Melevisione</em> for teenagers, and later an actual return on the original show but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar">as a completely different character</a>) and in later years started appearing on various social media to confirm that the replacement was not caused by any of those stories. Albeit the fact that he is gay is indeed true.
</li><li> Another rumor covers the fact that an episode of the show was among the many shows that were interrupted on September 11 2001 to talk about the World Trade Center plane crash, and how that show's interruption is how many children at the time were informed about it. The voice stated that the episode was interrupted during the recurring crafting segment, with Tonio saying "Now we take a yellow ribbon and..." before the interruption, with people literally going on Danilo's Facebook profile to ask him if he still remembers how the episode (which was apparently never reran) ends and what the yellow ribbon was for. Then Danilo answered that the "yellow ribbon" thing was a fabrication of someone's imagination when recalling the whole thing and the episode that was airing that day was a rerun of an older episode that has been reran multiple times.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> is subject to two of these, both related to his appearance as a celebrity guest on a game show:
<ul><li> It was initially rumored that he was barred from appearing on <em>The $10,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">screaming and throwing his chair in a fit of rage</a> upon accidentally blurting out the answer to his teammate. However, TV programming schedules bear out that Shatner was a guest a few more times after this.
</li><li> In November 1997, Shatner competed on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEdition">Celebrity Edition</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> but had to leave partway through and had another celebrity take his place for the rest of the episode. For many years it was rumored that he threw a temper tantrum over poor performance, similarly to the above-mentioned <em>Pyramid</em> episode. However, a fan asked host Pat Sajak on Twitter about this, and he confirmed that Shatner had to leave early because the taping ran into technical difficulties which created a scheduling conflict.
</li></ul></li><li> Rumor has it that during a break in taping one episode of <em>The $100,000 Pyramid</em>, host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark">Dick Clark</a> engaged in a conversation with celebrity player Dick Cavett. At one point, the other celebrity player, Jamie Farr, remarks how it feels to be standing between "two of the biggest Dicks in show business." Has never been confirmed, though what helps this rumor lean into the "not true" territory is the fact that almost <em>never</em> have the celebrity players been both male or female — one is almost always male, and the other is almost always female (the only exceptions being all-celebrity editions, with feature both a male and female on their team, and those only ever happened during the <em>$10,000</em> era of the early-mid '70s).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>: Perhaps the most well-known classic rock urban legend of all time, the "Paul is dead" legend led people to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> died in 1966 and was replaced by a look-and-soundalike from Scotland named William Campbell. Supposedly, clues to this are sprinkled throughout the group's post-1966 work, especially their album covers, with the iconic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad">Abbey Road</a></em> cover being singled out the most due to Paul being noticeably barefoot in the photo (corpses are usually buried barefoot). The very-much-alive Paul parodied this with the cover and title of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Is_Live">his 1993 live album<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <em>Paul is Live</em>.
<ul><li> A later rumor claimed that the original legend was created by Detroit DJ Russ Gibb as a publicity stunt. In fact, it had been circulating among college students in the Midwest for a few months, and Gibb only learned about it because someone called his show to talk about it before he became its main public proponent (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">No Such Thing as Bad Publicity</a> motives).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMamasAndThePapas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMamasAndThePapas">The Mamas &amp; the Papas</a>:
<ul><li> When Mama Cass Elliot suddenly died, rumours grew about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndignifiedDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndignifiedDeath">dying from choking on a ham sandwich</a>. She actually died in her sleep of heart failure. The rumour started after a half-eaten ham sandwich was found in the room she died in; a doctor who spoke with the press speculated that this sandwich could be the cause of her death. An autopsy later revealed that there was no food found in her windpipe.
<ul><li> Mama Cass Elliot's death also started a rumour about her being pregnant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s child. This is not true, as she and John were never a couple and had only briefly met once. The autopsy collected no evidence to support claims of pregnancy.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives">Elvis Lives</a>: The second most persistent urban legend is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> intentionally faked his own death and is still alive somewhere. This came out of the fact that his death certificate had numerous inconsistencies, and for a period of time, various tabloids reported on people who claimed to have seen him alive after his death. Most of these claims have been dismissed as being results of distraught fans not being able to accept his death.
</li><li> Elvis is far from the only musician to have a legend of faking their own death attributed to him. Others include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">Jim Morrison</a> (as his corpse was never autopsied) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur">Tupac Shakur</a> (since a good number of posthumous albums have been made, with some believing the music to be hinting at a comeback). There's a probably semi-joking theory out there that Jim Morrison is not only still alive, but that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>:
<ul><li> The song "In The Air Tonight" has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/intheair.asp">an urban legend<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which takes the first verse more literally. The most famous version of the legend claims that Phil and a friend are at a lake when the friend falls in and starts to drown. Phil is too far away to help, but sees someone closer and asks him to save his friend. The other person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction">refuses</a> and Phil's friend drowns. In response, Phil writes the song and invites the man to his next concert. He sings the song directly to the man who then runs out of the concert and kills himself. (Other versions involve a man doing something horrible to Phil, his friends, and/or his family, and when the man ends up in danger of drowning, Phil remembers what the man did and refuses to help.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Phil himself</a> says the legend is not true and he doesn't know where it came from.
</li><li> On a lighter note, there are several theories as to where the title of "Sussudio" came from. Some claim that it was the name of a pony that Phil's daughter had, while others claim he got the title from someone (such as his daughter or an employee) mispronouncing the word "studio". The truth is much more mundane: it was a piece of gibberish that he improvised, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">and he liked the way it sounded.</a> It was actually meant to be a placeholder lyric, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentPlaceholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentPlaceholder">he never found another word that worked just as well</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There is an urban legend surrounding the song "Love Rollercoaster" by The Ohio Players. In the song, a high-pitched scream is heard (between 1:24 and 1:28 on the single version, or between 2:32 and 2:36 on the album version). It <em>really</em> was Billy Beck, but the legend goes that the scream was an individual being murdered live during the recording. The scream's supposed source varies from version to version. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Rollercoaster">A lot of them involve Ester Cordet.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This urban legend gets a subtle reference in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination 3</a></em>, which uses this song (including the part with the scream) in the roller-coaster scene.
</li><li> "Gloomy Sunday" is also known as the Hungarian Suicide Song. The precise nature of the urban legend is a little different depending on who you ask, but the basic version is that the song can cause people to commit suicide. While creepy and sad, the song certainly won't make you kill yourself— not to mention that Hungary, where the supposed song-caused deaths occurred, historically has a high suicide rate to begin with. The legend was given a nod in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, where Monokuma runs a depressing video titled "Monokuma's Gloomy Sunday"<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and is the direct cause of the blackout deaths, hypnotizing its viewers into killing themselves.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabSpeech">Backmasking</a> has resulted in a few of these, most famously the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction">Subliminal Seduction</a> claims that "Revolution No. 9" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> secretly contains the phrase "turn me on, dead man" (tying in with the aforementioned "Paul is dead" rumor), "Stairway to Heaven" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> contains "here's to my sweet Satan," and "Another One Bites the Dust" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> contains "it's fun to smoke marijuana." None of these cases are true, and most apparent corroborations come from people being primed to interpret what amounts to nonsensical gibberish as a specific phrase.
</li><li> In fundamental Christian circles, it's popular to tell the story of an artist admitting to being approached by the devil and signed a contract to become famous musicians, under the condition of giving up their souls and/or putting subliminal satanic messages in their music to corrupt the youth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> (or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> himself), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> are the most popular targets of this rumor. Probably taken from the famous tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a>. The legend also inspired the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Jack Chick</a> comic "Angels?".
</li><li> On that note, the same people like to say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> stands for Against Christ/Devil's Child (actually, simply taken from the "alternating current/direct current" label on the back of the Youngs' sister's sewing machine) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> stands for Knights In Satan's Service (the band states it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>).
</li><li> Same thread as above, various bands have been accused of bringing various animals (usually puppies) to a show and having them thrown into the audience and stating they weren't going to start the show until all the animals were dead. KISS, Marilyn Manson, and Ozzy got this one the most. The rumors seem to stem from a real incident that happened during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> show, when fans threw a chicken on-stage and Cooper, having grown up in urban Detroit, threw it back under the assumption that it would fly away, only for the flightless bird to fall into and get torn to shreds by the audience. When news media exaggerated the incident to claim Cooper had <em>sacrificed</em> the chicken on-stage as part of a Satanic ritual, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> asked him about the incident, and upon hearing the true story, told them, "Whatever you do, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">don't tell anyone you didn't do it</a>." Another band, Coven, <em>did</em> hold Satanic masses on-stage during their lifetime, but none of them involved animal sacrifice. Another possible source is the notorious incident in 1977 where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale">John Cale</a>, in order to troll vegetarian band members and the audience, chopped a chicken up with a cleaver on stage in London, although in that case the chicken was already dead.
<ul><li> The rumors about it being Ozzy were so widely-believed he was cautioned by many local police about not doing animal sacrifices. His own real antics (biting the head off a pigeon, accidentally biting the head off a bat thinking it was rubber) didn't help this rumor at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton">George Clinton</a> may or may not have told Eddie Hazel to play the first half of the solo that runs throughout the whole of Funkadelic's "Maggot Brain" as if he'd just heard his mother had died, then play the second half as if he'd then heard the news of her death had turned out to be false. The truth will likely never be known; a lot of drugs were involved, and Hazel can no longer confirm or deny anything on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">guitarist existence failure</a>.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s death in 2009, reports that a guilt-stricken Jordan Chandler — the first person to publicly accuse him of child molestation back in 1993 — issued a statement claiming that he was forced to lie about the abuse by his greedy father began to circulate online. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a></em> quickly debunked this one, and Randall Sullivan's biography <em>Untouchable</em> traces it back to an email a fan sent to Jackson's mother shortly after his death. Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped his brother Jermaine and rabid fans from continuing to spread the legend (in truth, <em>none</em> of his accusers have taken back their claims).
</li><li> The band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM">KMFDM</a>'s initials standing for Kill Mother Fucking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode">Depeche Mode</a>. Stems mostly from fan speculation that resulted in a reporter asking if it was true, and them in turn saying: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">Sure, Let's Go with That</a>." In reality, it stands for "Kein Merheit fur die Mitleid" (roughly "no mercy for the masses" or "no pity for the majority" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">really poor German</a>). The urban legend is referenced in their song "Sucks", when they state that they "hate Depeche Mode" among other pop artists, and the song "Kunst", where the chorus is "KMFDM: Kill Mother Fucking Depeche Mode". Of course, the band's full name can be found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the liner notes of their first album</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> wrote at least part, if not all, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CourtneyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CourtneyLove">Hole's</a> second album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveThroughThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveThroughThis">Live Through This</a></em>. Kurt denied this while he was alive, Courtney Love and the rest of the band have denied it, early demos and live performances of some songs on the album were recorded before Kurt and Courtney were even dating and there's no real evidence of it anywhere (other than that he sang and played along with a few songs in their rehearsals during recording). Essentially, it boils down to people who just don't like Love, and want to deny she has any real talent (since the first <em>Hole</em> album, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrettyOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrettyOnTheInside">Pretty on the Inside</a>, written before Kurt and Courtney's relationship, is critically acclaimed and is agreed by most to be really good).
<ul><li> The most involvement Kurt is confirmed to have with the album is 1) singing uncredited backing vocals on a few songs, and 2) co-writing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> called "Old Age" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4fjj7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4fjj7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4fjj7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the latter may have started, or at least helped along, the rumors- the song was initially credited to Courtney Love alone, with her vaguely admitting in an interview it was adapted from someone else's unfinished song without naming whose. Bootlegs would reveal she had loosely adapted the Nirvana outtake "Old Age", keeping the chords and the chorus but rewriting most of the lyrics and somewhat altering the verse melody</span>
</li></ul></li><li> There's a similar urban legend among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop">Britpop</a> fans that Damon Albarn of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a> wrote most or all of the self-titled first album by Elastica, the band led by his then-girlfriend Justine Frischmann. Again, there's little to support this except dislike of Elastica and/or assumptions that women can't write music (Elastica took a notoriously long time to write a second album, but there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">well-attested reasons why</a>), and the songwriting is quite different from Albarn's usual style.

The urban legend is that, instead of re-recording the song with a different singer, Ministry's Al Jourgensen added additional distortion effects to Reznor's take and only claimed to have re-recorded the vocals himself. Jourgensen always maintained he sang it himself, even when there was no longer any potential for legal action.

No, he is not the son of Mr. Green Genes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainKangaroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainKangaroo">Captain Kangaroo</a></em>, just because the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotRats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotRats">Hot Rats</a></em> (1969) happened to have a track titled that way.

This is a legend that spun off from a joke made by DJ/author Stuart Maconie when he wrote for the NME. Adding even further layers of mythology, responsibility has also been claimed by another British DJ, Tommy Boyd, who claims he invented it for a 'True or False' quiz, and by Raphael Ravenscroft, the actual saxophonist, who was tired of being asked if he had played on the record and said it was Holness because he had recently worked with him on a TV commercial.
</li><li> Overlapping with Live-Action TV, two different generations have a variation on an urban legend that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former Child Star</a> grew up to be a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockRocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockRocker">Shock Rocker</a>:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, a rumor spread that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> was the eponymous character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em> while in reality he was played by Jerry Mathers (and Alice's birth name was Vincent Furnier).
</li><li> Meanwhile, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, a more popular legend spread that the incredibly nerdy Paul from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears">The Wonder Years</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">now</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5n65r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5n65r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5n65r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not that everything added up anyway, since the real actor was younger than Manson by almost a decade</span>. In reality, Paul's actor, Josh Savino, quit acting after the show ended to become a lawyer but is amused by the rumor since kids think he's cool as a result. Mr. Manson... not so much.
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of Marilyn Manson, that's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.houstonpress.com/music/man-that-you-fear-the-best-marilyn-manson-myths-ever-6761246">hardly the only one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to circulate about him. Other popular ones include claims that he had two ribs removed so that he could more easily suck his own penis (this is actually more attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cher">Cher</a>, though not the autofellatio part obviously and it doesn't apply for her either), that he gave away free drugs at his shows, and that he injected heroin into one of his eyeballs in order to get his heterochromia (the look actually comes from contact lenses). He's also one of the many musicians attached to the aforementioned legend about throwing puppies into the crowd for them to kill. He <em>is</em>, however, an honorary reverend in the Church of Satan.
</li><li> It's been widely rumored that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a> auditioned to be in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a></em>. While this isn't as implausible as it might initially sound, since Manson was on the fringes of the Los Angeles music scene in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, pursuing a career as a singer-songwriter and befriending Dennis Wilson of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> (with the group even recording a rewritten version of a Manson song), the auditions took place in 1965, and Manson was in prison at the time for trying to forge and cash a U.S. Treasury check. He didn't get released until March of 1967.
</li><li> The Vapors' hit "Turning Japanese" is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">masturbation</a>. This is cited as true but the band has said that it isn't. In reality, there's no official meaning behind the song. In fact, it's just one of many songs frequently stated by the public to be secretly about jerking off, and in nearly all cases the artists confirm that they're not.
</li><li> The La's song "There She Goes" is widely believed to be song about heroin addiction due to the questionable lyric "Pulsing through my veins". The song has nothing to do with heroin; it's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSong">Silly Love Song</a>.
</li><li> There was a demo cassette from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LosPrisioneros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LosPrisioneros">Los Prisioneros</a> that was given from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadBassist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadBassist">Jorge González</a> to a fan with various demo songs from all albums as well some live recordings and unreleased songs (especially from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBand">Fake Band</a> "Gus Gusano y sus Hemofílicos Necrofílicos"), which was cataloged as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> by the fans and only mentioned in some of the group's biography books. Just like other bootleg discs that were lost, this trope became averted since finally the disc was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RereleasedForFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RereleasedForFree">Rereleased for Free</a> on the internet by the fan who owned the cassette under the name of <em>Raspando la Olla</em> ("Scratching the Pot", a Chilean slang about getting the leftovers), after the final breakup of Los Prisioneros in 2006.

<ul><li> A long-standing rumour amongst many Star Wars collectors is that someone did indeed see a rocket-firing Boba Fett figure in the mail in 1979 or that it received a very limited carded release. These claims have both since been proven false however, as Kenner only produced internal prototype test samples of the figure before its firing function was scrapped. The actual Kenner prototypes of the figure started finding their way onto the collectors market in the 90s although this has also led to many fakes and counterfeit carded samples appearing as well.
</li><li> Going along with the Boba Fett rumour, a claim that a <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> toy causing a childs death was the reason for the removal of the figures rocket firing feature has also been debunked. Various internal company notes from Kenner have surfaced showing that the rocket mechanism was simply too easy to set off, causing safety issues and that the feature was scrapped months prior to the Battlestar Galactica toy incident.

<ul><li> Cheap Photoshop-jobs of fake sets, often made to look like grainy pictures taken from a retailer's catalog, regularly caught on within the fandom, as have rumors of alternate builds of certain models being sold as separate sets. So when similarly fake-looking images of two supposedly Korean-exclusive Piraka combo model sets surfaced, there were many discussions on their legitimacy, especially since they were totally unknown in the Western world and their packaging also contained bad Photoshop work. These are now seen as real since Korea tends to release their own multi-packs. Legit leaks of the line's unexpected 2015 reboot were also initially dismissed for this reason.
</li><li> The same thing surfaced with the 2015 reboot, with claims of new Toa (including a new version of fan-favorite Takanuva), the return of the Bohrok, and more showing up in the same grainy, out-of-focus manner as the originals. One that got dismissed as fake, ironically, was an ultimately cancelled Makuta set, which appears to have been planned for the series' third and final arc before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a>.
</li><li> Voriki, the "Seventh Toa", was a fan-made character created for a 2001 contest using recolored official artwork with a mask and a weapon obviously edited in Photoshop. Despite this, many fans believed him to be official, though the release of a canonical Seventh Toa in 2003 dispelled all rumors. Voriki has since become a celebrity of sorts among the fandom's original characters, and some have even made custom models of him with painted and 3D-printed parts.
</li></ul></li><li> There are rumors of a Mallow plush and a Geno plush from the 1996 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em> Japanese plush set line. However, the Mallow plush has only been seen twice online and it's unclear if it's a bootleg or not. In contrast, no official Geno plush photos or videos have even been revealed, but it's a rumor that Geno <em>does</em> have an official plush.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em> was not the result of Mattel repackaging a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> toyline to divert it from a kid-unfriendly film.

</li><li> Starting in 2009, a claim began circulating in anti-vaxxer circles that Raggedy Ann was created by Johnny Gruelle in remembrance of his daughter Marcella, who died in 1915 from a smallpox vaccination. While there <em>is</em> a kernel of truth to this story, development on Raggedy Ann had already been finished by the time Marcella died (in fact, Gruelle had filed his patent for the dolls months before), she was never intended as any kind of warning about vaccines, and there's no proof that Marcella's fatal infection after her inoculation was anything but a tragic coincidence (at most, the vaccination led to the infection, something that was unfortunately a legitimate risk in those days).

There is <em>some</em> grain of truth to the myth: several people got sick from playing games at the arcade, however, these people were playing for long spans of time and it was usually nothing worse than a migraine or stomach ache. FBI agents were also known to hang around arcades, however, this was because early 1980s arcades had seedy reputations associated with drugs and gambling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Pokémon</em> has the urban legend known as <em>Lavender Town Syndrome</em> which is an urban legend about suicides in the nineties in Japan after kids played the original <em>Red and Green</em> versions and were driven insane by the song that plays in Lavender Town. A lesser version claims that there are higher-pitched tones that cause subtle discomfort and only children can fully hear them, that were changed in the localized <em>Red and Blue</em>. While the song is certainly creepy, if there is any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a>, it's in all four versions — all the music is bit-for-bit identical in all four of <em>Red and Green</em>, Japanese <em>Blue</em>, <em>Red and Blue</em>, and <em>Yellow</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonBlack">Pokémon Black</a></em> (not to be confused with an installment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>) was a rumored bootleg cartridge or romhack. It gives you a "ghost" Pokémon that you can never switch out of your party, which no opponents can attack, and whose only move, "Curse", is almost always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a>. If you fight a trainer, each curse causes the ball containing your opponent's mon to disappear from his roster. When he has no Pokémon left, you can now curse him directly; doing so causes him to disappear forever (or turn into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantGravestone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantGravestone">Instant Gravestone</a>). When you beat the Elite Four, you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> to yourself as an old man, where you see a vision of every mon and trainer you cursed, and your ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">turns on you</a> and subjects you to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>. When your HP hits zero, it curses you; the screen turns black and will not change. If you reset the game, your save file will be erased.

</li><li> The remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> have an extremely-persistent-even-after-debunked rumor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Youngster Joey's "top-percentage" Rattata</a> is in fact coded to have perfect Internal Values.
</li><li> A 2005 April Fool's prank started a rumor of a remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeyYouPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeyYouPikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> that introduced a new Pokémon called "Korechu".
</li><li> There is an urban legend that the Shadow Triad were originally meant to be revealed as the Striaton Trio in <em>Black 2 &amp; White 2</em> but this was changed in development. This stems from a theory that originated from the triplets being absent during the climax of <em>Black &amp; White</em> and was egged on by the <em>Adventures</em> manga (which later revealed the similarities to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>). Even after the sequel games confirmed that they're not the same characters, concept art depicting the Shadow Triad's original <em>BW2</em> designs (including one having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a> similar to Cress') has led to this idea being circulated amongst the fandom. Either way, it's never been confirmed to be more than speculation.
</li><li> Shortly after the announcement of <em>Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</em>, someone noticed Nintendo registered a trademark for <em>Delta Emerald</em>, sparking more rumors. However, this is probably a blanket trademark; Nintendo has been doing this kind of thing for a long time,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6tsfb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6tsfb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6tsfb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, "White Gold", incorrectly presumed pre-2009 to be the name of a remake of <em>Gold</em>; it remained unused in favor of <em>HeartGold</em></span> and it says nothing about whether or not they intend on actually making the game.
</li><li> After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, a slew of alleged screenshots from a new update of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMasters">Pokémon Masters</a></em> featuring multiple references to the new games appeared, such as Iris stating that the Galar champion Leon is her cousin and Blue complaining about his Pidgeot not being allowed to go in the Galar region. Such screenshots are all fabrications.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar in ways to both <em>Polybius</em> and Lavender Town's music is a rumored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> game called <em>Misfortune</em> (also known as <em>Misfortune.gb</em>). The story goes that it was never released on its own cartridge, and instead was hidden in other more popular games, only accessible by a convoluted sequence of actions or through glitches, and even then whether or not these attempts would succeed was random. Failing at the game would lead to a screen with music that supposedly caused depression and might even lead to the player's suicide. If you won the game, or failed but turned it off before the music in question started, you were safe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> It is claimed by some people that the name of the main character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> video games was the result of a mistranslation and that his name was supposed to be "Monkey Kong". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> himself denied this; the character got his name because the word "donkey" describes his stubbornness. (Inevitably, among the dozens of clones of the original game is one titled <em>Monkey Kong</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColorComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColorComputer">Color Computer</a>.)
</li><li> That <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> was originally supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">SNES</a> game. This one derives from a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em> article where Shigeru Miyamoto claimed to be working on a 3D <em>Mario</em> game at the same time as the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em> game. It would have been called <em>Super Mario FX</em>, which turned out to be a misunderstanding based on the fact that the Super FX chip was codenamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">MARIO</a>; supposedly, it would have powered the game (and it did power <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em>). The Super FX 2 chip <em>is</em> utilized by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em>, which contains Mario, but that's an entirely 2D game that uses the chip for its enhanced sprite-manipulation features.
</li><li> Ashley from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a></em> is usually stated as being 8 years old in Japanese but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">15 internationally</a>. The latter is true, but in Japanese, her age is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">never stated</a> (though her voice acting and speech patterns imply she's supposed to be rather young).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>: It's widely believed that the game was originally going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> where Luigi had to save Mario before dawn or the mansion would vanish along with Mario. While there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> timer for the Game Boy Horror that was seen in some pre-release materials, this was simply to keep E3 attendees from hogging the playable demo. Another rumor is that there was originally going to be a hunter ghost in the Safari Room that wanted to add Luigi's head to his collection. There is no evidence in the game's coding of such a ghost, and the rumor came from a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em> caption that came out <strong>after</strong> the game was released in Japan.
</li><li> Prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> coming out, a screencap of a supposed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisSafari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisSafari">Yoshi's Safari</a></em>-like game appeared online. <a class="urllink" href="http://lsupersonicq.blogspot.com/2014/06/hardly-beta.html">It showed a third-person 3D game involving a purple Yoshi.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The veracity of the image has never been proven, though either way, no such game ever came out.

</li><li> In 1996, Electronic Gaming magazine mentioned an upcoming game called <em>Mario's Castle</em> coming for the next Game Boy (the unreleased "Project Atlantis"). It's unknown if this rumor was accurate or not. No evidence has ever been found for the game existing.
</li><li> There's an urban legend surrounding an article in the UK version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em>. It supposedly revealed that Bowser has, or had, a wife named "Clawdia Koopa". This rumor is so widespread it's appeared on the Mario Wikia (but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SuperMarioWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SuperMarioWiki">Super Mario Wiki</a>, which instead lists it on its "Rumors and Urban Legends" page). Not only does no such quote exist, but <em>Nintendo Power</em> was never released in Europe. Canon has yet to clarify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">who Junior's mother is</a>, besides <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/uu2DnTd3dEo">Miyamoto joking in a video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that it was himself.

The announcement came up in April 2003 in the French gaming magazine <em>Joystick</em>, but eventually it turned out to be a late April Fools joke.
</li><li> <em>Ed, Edd n Eddy: Junkyard Scramble</em> was a puzzle game by Crawfish Interactive which, according to rumors, has been cancelled in favor of <em>Jawbreakers!</em>. In 2017, a former employee of Crawfish denied that the game ever existed, which means that everyone was likely confusing it with <em>Jawbreakers!</em>.
</li><li> <em>Croc 3: Stone of the Gobbos</em>, a hoaxed sequel to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc">Croc</a></em> series.

While it is true they made some custom levels, there is no reason to think they were designed like this.
</li><li> <em>Kekcroc</em> started out as a joke, but people who didn't get the joke started taking it seriously as an actual piece of lost media. The story goes that <em>Kekcroc</em> is supposedly a 1993 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> game that appeared at local discount stores before disappearing. Some have claimed to have played the game, or have played ports on DOS, NES and Game Boy. "Evidence" of the game appears in crude screen shots, box art, and an audio clip.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em>, prolific prankster on April Fools' Day, suckered in a lot of people with its claim of a realistic remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> rendered with the graphical engine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7f1kf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7f1kf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7f1kf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which presumably isn't that hard to do, as they both use the same game engine</span>. They claimed it was available with a <em>Twilight Princess</em> pre-order and photoshopped Link fighting a bird enemy in <em>Twilight Princess</em> style in an area clearly from <em>The Wind Waker</em>. People asked local retailers if the pre-order offer was real, and the May issue included letters mocking those who were fooled.
</li><li> During development, a rumor arose simultaneously about <em>The Wind Waker</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>. <em>Wind Waker</em> was unique in that Link would have to save his sister, rather than Zelda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveThePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveThePrincess">as usual</a>. Fans remembered a scene from early in <em>Link to the Past</em> when Link's uncle tells him "Zelda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisNameIs">is your...</a>" — now they believed that he meant "sister", and Link and Zelda were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostRelative">secret siblings</a>. <em>The Wind Waker</em> revealed that the sister was a completely different character, but that didn't stop people from thinking this was true in <em>both</em> games. The GBA remake of <em>Link to the Past</em> changed the "Zelda is your..." speech entirely, squashing the rumors once and for all.

While this was another April Fools' joke, enough people thought motorcycle-Epona was really cool that it started showing up for real. Link appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em> with an Epona-themed motorcycle, and while the idea of a modern-day Link with a motorcycle and electric guitar was scrapped for what became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, the option to obtain a motorcycle was eventually added as part of the second set of DLC.
</li><li> A half-finished prototype of an unreleased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a> game called <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga</em>. This was a hoax; it was put up for auction on eBay in 2005, and someone paid $3000 for what turned out to be an empty cartridge.
</li><li> The blonde Kokiri girl from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, known officially as Fado, was originally developed as the Wind Sage before being replaced by Saria. This is simply fan-speculation based on her unique design and personality for a minor NPC. It's also speculated that the male Fado from <em>The Wind Waker</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedForTheSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedForTheSequel">the concept repurposed</a> in a sequel.
</li></ul></li><li> It's often said that the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> in its home country of Japan is so immense that it's illegal to release a new game in the series on a weekday in fear of kids cutting class to buy the game. This was even purported as fact by video game documentaries and articles. In actuality, while people skipping school or work to buy <em>Dragon Quest</em> games at launch was a big enough problem that there were hearings in the National Diet, the law was never actually passed. Enix did voluntarily start only releasing the games on weekends as a response to the controversies, however.

<ul><li> One pervasive <em>Sonic</em> rumor stems around Tails, more specifically his gender. The rumor stipulates that Tails was originally designed as a female love interest to Sonic (or at least that, like Amy, he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a>), and that Dreams Come True's song "Sweet Dream" (which used <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em>'s ending theme as a base) would've been dedicated to this relationship. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> by Tails' creator; he was always supposed to be male.
</li><li> There was a rumor of a Wii U exclusive sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, <em>Sonic Dimensions</em>, which would make up for <em>Generations</em> not being released on Wii or Wii U (due to the Wii's low power and the Wii U being released too late for the anniversary). The 25th-anniversary game was delayed from 2016 to 2017 so it could be released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo's new console</a>, although in that case, it's not a console exclusive.
</li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopStarComposer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopStarComposer">was involved with the third game's soundtrack.</a> Masato Nakamura of Dreams Come True composed the music for the first two games but didn't return for the third game due to royalties for his work becoming too expensive for Sega's preference. When fans noticed the musical similarities between some of the game's tracks and some of Jackson's songs, they put two and two together, and the rumor wrote itself. Unlike most examples of this trope however, this rumor was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">later confirmed</a> a <em>decade</em> after it began; Jackson is merely uncredited in the final version. Now the rumor is over whether Jackson himself pulled out because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">he was dissatisfied with how the soundtrack translated to the Genesis's synthesizer</a>, or whether Sega did it themselves due to the controversy surrounding Jackson's child molestation accusations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2SpecialEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2SpecialEdition">Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Special Edition</a></em> is a supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> which never finished beta testing. Docfuture made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a>, purporting it to be the only surviving evidence of its existence. In fact, Docfuture made up the game specifically for the LP, building it from an anachronistic mishmash of ROM hacks and complete nonsense. He cites the real rumors surrounding <em>Sonic 2</em> as the inspiration for <em>Sonic 2: Special Edition</em>, going so far as to make a fictitious TV ad in which one of the game's developers says that they "added a shitload of secrets into this thing".
</li><li> UltraJMan made an LP of the "Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Beta Edition", featuring such things as Sonic riding a motorcycle, a boss fight with the Tails Doll, and an implied homosexual relationship between Sonic and Tails. The game is, of course, fanmade, but JMan spends the whole LP pretending that it's an official release.
</li><li> From the mid '90s up until the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>, there floated around rumors of a game called "Sonic and Knuckles RPG"; it wound up on a few "Coming Soon" lists around the time the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> was unveiled to the public, due to confusion over talking points (<em>Adventure</em> was said to contain RPG elements). When <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> was announced, there was some speculation that it was the project that Sonic and Knuckles RPG evolved into. As of this writing, there exists no evidence of a scrapped or retooled Sonic RPG developed in that time frame. And while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle">Sonic Battle</a></em> does have a few RPG elements in it, it's unlikely that the game is the rumored RPG. It took another 5 years beyond <em>that</em> (and 7 from the release of <em>Adventure 2</em>) for Sonic to finally appear in an RPG, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicChronicles">Sonic Chronicles</a>: The Dark Brotherhood</em>.
</li><li> There's a long-standing rumor that Knuckles' fur patch was related to a deal with Nike that fell through. The interview that mentions the Nike promotion implied that Sega had attempted a promotion with Nike <em>because</em> of Knuckles' moon crest, not that the crest itself is due to a Nike promotion.
</li><li> Urban legend is that Tails was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki">tanuki</a>. This is a misconception; the tanuki was only a placeholder and was from a different project. Tails was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">kitsune</a>, before just becoming a two-tailed fox because kitsune are obscure outside of Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> For years, rumors of a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> game circulated the Internet thanks to rumors from sites like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>, a series of relentless prank calls to GameStop demanding pre-orders for <em>Battletoads</em>, and even fake websites promised that <em>Battletoads</em> was coming soon. But as fate would have it, <em>Battletoads</em> was officially announced at E3 2018.
</li><li> There is a rumor that there are unreleased versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII">Tomb Raider II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a>, respectively. The two games are believed to contain various unused assets not included in other releases. These range from different outfits, unused weapons, better lighting (in the case of <em>Tomb Raider III</em>), and even unreleased levels, such as the entire Peru section that was cut from the final version of <em>Tomb Raider III</em>.
</li><li> There's a recurring rumor in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> fandom that the in-series singers (especially Pearl and Marina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>) sing in English. They don't. Official lyrics to certain songs were included with the games' soundtracks, confirming that the characters speak a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Conlang</a> that can't be translated into <em>any</em> current real-world language. Any resemblance to English usually turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">a misunderstanding</a>.
</li><li> <em>Yeah Yeah Beebiss I</em> was listed as an NES game on a Play It Again mail order form in <em>Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment</em> magazine, and on a Funco mail order form as <em>Yeah Beebiss I</em>. Speculation on the identity of the game ran rampant on sites like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/LostMediaWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/LostMediaWiki">Lost Media Wiki</a>. The most likely candidate is a game in the <em>Family Trainer</em> series for the Famicom, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/579388-family-trainer-rai-rai-kyonshis-baby-kyonshi-no-amida/images/120004">Rai Rai Kyonshis: Baby Kyonshi no Amida Daibouken<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, where the player directs the movements of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseVampire">Chinese Vampire</a> with the Power Pad.
</li><li> The unreleased localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby">The Great Gatsby</a></em> adaptation on the NES, known in Japanese as <em>Doki Doki Toshokan: Gatsby no Monogatari</em>, was found at a yard sale and purchased for fifty cents, with the instruction manual rubber banded to the cartridge, and a 1990 magazine ad. No further hard copies are known to exist, but luckily, the game was fan translated and made available online. There's a good reason why there aren't any other hard copies: <strong>it's not actually an NES game.</strong> It's just a Flash game with some cleverly-faked adverts.
</li><li> Every once in a while a rumor for a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> game (usually involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaughtyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaughtyDog">Naughty Dog</a>) pops up. A frequent title is <em>Crash Bandicoot 3D: Uka Uka Resurrection</em>. Eventually, the series was revived —<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy">with remakes</a>, not a new game.
</li><li> There was an old rumor that Timber of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing">Diddy Kong Racing</a></em> would have his own game with Pipsy and Bumper as his co-stars, which Rare has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gonintendo.com/s/186836-former-rare-devs-talk-wii-u-3ds-interest-clear-up-timber-64-rumor-talk-donkey-kong-racing">denied<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While it is true that Timber was the protagonist of <em>Pro Am 64</em> before it was retooled into <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, the alleged <em>Timber 64</em> was supposed to have been a different game entirely.
</li><li> Electronic Gaming Monthly came out with an April Fool's joke about a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> crossover called <em><a class="urllink" href="http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc71/ultracoolman/mushroom-kingdom-hearts_mini.jpg">Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em> Some people bought it, of course.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> was not re-released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">outside Japan</a> for the longest time, which led to many rumors as to why. Eventually, people settled on the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">they couldn't license some of the in-game music samples</a> (and Nintendo didn't want to alter the original game). Then the game <em>did</em> get an American re-release on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> with minimal edits (none of which affect the music), which torpedoed that theory; now fans apply the theory to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> instead.
</li><li> Back in the 1980s, there were rumors surrounding the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissileCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MissileCommand">Missile Command</a></em> game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat">the Pentagon kept track of high scorers</a>, in case of a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarThree">World War III</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>:
<ul><li> There tends to be a rumor (or an accusation) made that a certain male townsperson (specifically, a cat named Bob) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">wears a dress</a>. According to some, this is a programming error  he's supposed to have normal "guy" clothing. However, this is false  Bob wears the same type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal">sacklike clothing</a> both male and female cats wear. His "default" shirt pattern has flowers on it, but it's a flower shirt that is available to all characters (players included) and is worn indiscriminately regardless of gender. <em>New Leaf</em> makes it more noticeable that it's a shirt.
</li><li> There was actually a massive hoax perpetrated at one point regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingCityFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingCityFolk">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a></em>. A young child was playing the game when supposedly Tortimer asked the child for either a photo or some personal information. The child's parent apparently saw this and came to the conclusion that a hacker had made his was into her child's Wii. She removed the game, contacted the authorities, and told them. Suddenly, the Missouri Police are sending out threat warnings to everyone that Tortimer is actually the avatar for some pervert who is trying to solicit children for sexual favors, photos, or confidential information. While it didn't take long for gamers to realize the absolute ridiculousness of this (Nobody can join a game in <em>Animal Crossing: City Folk</em> without first exchanging a 12-digit code with each other outside of the game; Tortimer is in fact an NPC and not controlled by players, and even offline one can encounter him), it didn't take long for parents in the Missouri area to panic that someone was trying to invade their children's video games. When the state tried to sue Nintendo, Nintendo simply proved them wrong with the coding and hard facts, and the Missouri Police quickly stopped talking about it, egg all over their faces.
</li></ul></li><li> Originally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> had a scene showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caroline being forced into the mind uploading despite her objections</span>, but the scene was later cut. Since a few of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenMcLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenMcLain">Ellen McLain</a></span>'s lines in the scene were left in the game files, numerous rumors began to circulate that either <strong><span class="asscaps">A)</span></strong> the scene was initially present in the plot but later removed; or <strong><span class="asscaps">B)</span></strong> since the scene played out like a rape, several cast and crew members objected to it (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ellen McLain, who burst into tears</span>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKSimmons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKSimmons">J. K. Simmons</a>, who refused to record lines for the scene, hence the absence of his lines in the game files), which ultimately forced it to be cut. Despite the obvious contradiction of J.K. Simmons getting offended at acting in a rape scene <em>despite doing an actual rape scene previously in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6339609.html?tag=nl.e577">Erik Wolpaw has had to confirm that these rumors are false<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. No comments have been made on the actual reason for the cutting of the scene.
</li><li> In the mid-2000s, a rumor circulated online that Nintendo had created a cat version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a></em> named "Nintencats". It was either never released because they believed a cat-based game wouldn't sell or it was a Japan-only game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">was too poorly received to be released anywhere else</a>. No such game exists. Since then, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">"Nintendogs + Cats" has been released</a>.

</li><li> Every few years there is a new rumor of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a> 2", but they are never real.
</li><li> Just prior to the reveal of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>, there was a convincing hoax known as the "Nintendo ON". It was a Virtual Reality device you strapped to your head.
</li><li> The Madden Curse is akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">the Curse of the Bambino</a> and other notable sports curses. The superstition states that, when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">NFL</a> player appears on the cover of the latest edition of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em> series, either a) he and/or his team will not be up to snuff in the upcoming NFL season, or b) will suffer a major injury and be sidelined for much of the year. <br/>Related to this curse are the "Campbell's Chunky Soup" curse, which claims that any NFL athlete featured in a commercial for said soup is bound for misfortune, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/SportsIllustrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/SportsIllustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></em> cover jinx, which doesn't confine itself to football — when Colorado Rockies pitcher Jeff Francis made the cover when the team was heading towards the World Series, fans wasted no time in their backlash and accused <em>SI</em> of being in cahoots with the Rockies' would-be World Series opponent, the Boston Red Sox. Sure enough, the Rockies lost and the Sox won. <br/>The curse may be spreading to other EA Sports titles, too.

<ul><li> The Madden Curse, if it truly existed, was finally been broken in 2020. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was featured on the cover of <em>Madden NFL 20</em>. At first it seemed like he would be another victim; he got an ankle injury shortly into the regular season, and people feared it might be an ACL ,tear taking him out for the season. Instead, it was a mild sprain, and Mahomes recovered. He ended up leading his team to victory in Super Bowl LIV, winning Super Bowl MVP at that, breaking the curse.
</li></ul></li><li> The bizarre circumstances surrounding the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookingMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookingMama">Cooking Mama: Cookstar</a></em> gave rise to the theory that it exists as a way of mining cryptocurrency using the player's console. This is largely thanks to a press release by the game's publisher that claimed the game would be the first to use 'blockchain-based DRM'; after the game was removed from sale just hours after its release (as well as people who played it saying that their systems ran hot while playing), the cryptocurrency idea took off. In reality, there is no evidence that the game features any form of blockchain technology, with the likely explanation being that the publisher was merely spouting popular IT buzzwords to try and impress investors. Meanwhile, the actual reason for the game's storefront removal was a dispute between the publisher and the IP holder, and the reports of console overheating seem to just be the game being poorly optimized.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, the title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> was not chosen because Square was about to go bankrupt. In reality, creator Hironobu Sakaguchi wanted the initials "FF" for the game, but his first choice, <em>Fighting Fantasy</em>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy">already taken</a>.
</li><li> There was occasional speculation on the now-defunct Relic Entertainment forums that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> was originally conceived as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattlestarGalactica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattlestarGalactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> licensed game before licensing issues resulted in it being reworked into an original IP. Other than having a few tropes in common the two franchises aren't really similar enough that <em>Homeworld</em> could be called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualLicensee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualLicensee">Spiritual Licensee</a>, so if this <em>was</em> the original intention the idea was dropped at a very early stage in development.

<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></em> cartoon is full of these:
<ul><li> Shaggy and Scooby were meant to be a sly shoutout to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">stoners</a>. In reality, the original writers of <em>Scooby-Doo</em> weren't of that generation, and had little knowledge of the stoner culture. Shaggy was actually inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beatnik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beatnik">beatnik</a> stereotypes (the real beatniks did frequently use marijuana, but by the time the show was made their pop-culture image had been sanitized of any associations with drug use).
</li><li> The gang is supposed to represent five certain universities. One of the universities wasn't even established for two years after the show went into production. In reality, they are loosely based on the characters from the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManyLovesOfDobieGillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManyLovesOfDobieGillis">The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis</a></em>.
</li><li> That the creators intentionally put in Fred/Daphne subtext and that Velma was a lesbian. Neither is true. Anything between Fred and Daphne is pure speculation. The show was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a> show anyway. It isn't until later installments that the series canonized the couple, precisely <em>because</em> of the rumors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">Running the Asylum</a>. Velma's sexuality was never discussed in the original cartoon.
</li><li> Many remember Shaggy having an Adam's apple in his throat, when this is not the case in the actual show.
</li></ul></li><li> A rumor was started for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut">South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</a></em> about a deleted character named "Flower" who allegedly sends herself to Hell to let Kenny be freed in the end. While some fan wikis still circulate it and believe it to be true, it was actually based off of a fake "deleted scene" theory made by a fan <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050207225855/http://fruitbowl.spcomplete.com/Spy.html">to "fill in the gap" of how Kenny could wind up in Heaven at the end of the film despite not being a Mormon.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The same fan site had come up with <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204225318/http://fruitbowl.spcomplete.com/solved.html">other<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204222612/http://fruitbowl.spcomplete.com/Consp.html">similarly wild fanon theories<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to explain the presence of commonly reused background characters in both the series and film. In the end, it could be best summarized as someone's Wild Mass Guess that was taken a little too seriously by portions of the fanbase.
</li><li> The 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> TV cartoon series is subject to a famous urban legend to the effect that the final episode (often reportedly never broadcast, although some people have claimed to have seen it on TV) reveals that the characters were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">killed in a roller-coaster accident</a> and that the setting is Hell. The writer of the actual unmade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, Michael Reeves, has denied this and placed his script for the episode online to prove it. (His script ends with the kids deliberating after being offered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding">choice</a> whether to go back to Earth or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay">continue</a> fighting evil in the D&amp;D world.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Probably the biggest one is about the name of the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">Eddy's Brother</a>. There were rumors about his name being "Matthew", supposedly because the show's creator Danny Antonucci named him "Matthew" in a DVD interview. Many fans apparently believed that and even on this wiki the name "Matthew" was repeatedly added as "confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>". Except that there's no source for that at all and Antonucci's only DVD interview doesn't even mention Eddy's Brother.
</li><li> It has one involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> known as "Special Ed," formed by an apparent hack on the creator's own website and editing an interview to add it. To this date, there is still no more information known about this episode other than its title and it being removed for being "too real," and it still isn't fully confirmed nor denied if that was a hack or Danny Antonucci's actual words. Fans also believe that the episode was about Ed being in special education however that is simply speculation. The characters didn't finish summer vacation until a few seasons after the interview.
</li><li> In 2001, there was another rumor about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a> known only as "The Scarecrow Boy Episode". The story is that Sarah puts on a play - her own version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> - casting herself as Dorothy, Jimmy as the Tin Man, Eddy as the Cowardly Lion (apparently he was also tied to a chair the whole time because he kept trying to walk out on Sarah), Ed as the Scarecrow, and Double D as the director. Sarah became outraged with Ed continuously blowing his lines, and ended up kicking and locking him out of the house (while still in costume); when Kevin and other kids in the cul-de-sac see Ed roaming around, they keep calling him "Scarecrow Boy", which somehow causes Ed to grow stiffer and stiffer each time he heard the name. Eventually, the episode ends with Plank nestled into the ground, and Ed standing on top with his arms straight out, as if he has become a real scarecrow. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that remotely proves such an episode exists, though many fans swear to have seen it, and that it only aired once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> tends to be a major victim of this thanks to combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">God Never Said That</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a>, but the episode "Invader Dib" is one of the longest-lasting of these. Said to be the intended series finale, it was going to be a three-part episode/television movie wherein Dib would travel to Irk and attempt to take over or destroy the Irken race. This would lead to a large war with Dib, the Meekrob, and The Resisty on one side, and Zim, the rest of the Irken, and even Gaz on the other. How this would have ended depends on the source, with the common ending having Zim win, somehow becoming the new Tallest, and banishing Dib to Saturn/turning him into a military test subject. Of all of that, creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez">Jhonen Vasquez</a> having had an idea for a story where Dib goes to Irk is the only part that is true; the series was cancelled before it could be expanded upon, much less have an outline or script written, and the other writers have stated that Vasquez was still privately playing around with the plot details at the time. Vasquez would later share some of the ideas he had for a potential finale at a fan convention, but the concept he discussed (every race in the universe coming together to fight a single threat) shared no elements with this or any other rumored storyline.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig">Sanjay and Craig</a></em> fans were convinced by a long-gone Wikipedia edit that a character named Satine would be featured as Craig's love interest in an episode called "Snake In Love"; the rumor somewhat died down after the final 7 episodes were revealed, but Satine is still treated as an actual character in some circles.
</li><li> For a while, there were a couple of people spreading news of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> movie called "<em>Powerful Alliances</em>" that was to come out in '15, creating a Wikipedia article and IMDb entry for it, and spreading bogus rumors on other sites. It was basically a bunch of fans trying to pass off their "dream <em>TF</em> movie" as real. Although everything about it screams fake, especially the amazingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a>-y cast list, not to mention that the supposed voice actors themselves said they haven't heard of such a project, the rumor became very persistent. After the Wiki and IMDb pages were deleted, another rumor started, claiming that it's been canceled, instead of not being real in the first place.
</li><li> Similarly, sometime in 2006, someone made a Wikipedia entry for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a> called "Journey to The Imaginary World" or something to that effect. It involved Mac and Bloo discovering a door to a parallel universe and going inside to find oddities like a green version of Wilt. Unlike the <em>Transformers</em> example, this one didn't stick, but it became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> when a similar plot was used for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Destination Imagination</em>.
</li><li> There's a rumor amongst <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em> fans that Courtney was meant to confess to Ginger that she loves her near the end. Ginger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">doesn't feel the same</a> and softly turns her down, letting Courtney move on with her life accepting she's gay. It's said Nick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">refused</a> the plot, and they replaced it with the final ending. Specifically, it was a quickly done edit and the scene with Courtney crying in the bathroom was originally where Courtney confessed to Ginger. Alas, no one seems to have any concrete proof to where this rumor originates. It was apparently said at a convention in the 2000s however it's unknown if that's accurate or not. Series creator Emily Kapnek has since debunked the rumors, stating that she never said that and there were never plans for Courtney to come out.
</li><li> There is a long-running rumor that there were plans in the early '90s to make an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> animated series titled <em>Operation: Aliens</em> which supposedly had a pilot produced before being scrapped, based on a set of animation frames uploaded on a long-defunct Korean website. In 2018, the director and producer of the animation put up a storyboard on eBay and <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180404032524/https://www.ebay.com/itm/-/362286068516?roken=cUgayN&amp;soutkn=QN2XXX">explained<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the description that such a series never existed and that the animation was actually for three toy commercials, which ended up being unused after the producer of the live-action portion of said commercials found a better technique to film the toys and opted to use that instead.
</li><li> Sometime around 2013-2014, someone edited the Italian Wikipedia page for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyLooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyLooneyTunes">Baby Looney Tunes</a></em> to mention the existence of two unaired episodes that are <em>way</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than the remainder of the show featuring Zeno, Sylvester's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> who wants to kill his brother in his desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. The page for the character was a blatant copypaste of the description for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">a completely different character</a> sharing that name and the fact that it clearly mentions that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> banned the episode only in Italy when there is no proof of such an episode existing in any language made the hoax obvious.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> has the episode "Rude Removal". During 2000s, rumours circulated about a episode that was allegedly shown once or twice at conventions that featured Dexter and Dee Dee being split into good and evil halves, with the evil counterparts being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot">Sir Swears A Lots</a> that spent much of the runtime doing just that as the good versions tried to corral them. The episode, said to be a joke episode produced as a way for the crew to release some steam during a hectic production, was also stated to have all that cussing uncensored. The episode would eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x147ryp">turn out to be real<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and received an airing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> in 2013 before being briefly posted online. After its airing, creator Genndy Tartakovsky would clarify that the censored cartoon that aired is the only version of the short that they produced<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10dsse');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10dsse" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10dsse');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the "uncensored" variant you see on most video hosting sites is actually a fan creation, but the belief that this the real episode means that the <em>actual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">official version is still difficult to find</a></span>, and that it was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode">Banned Episode</a> meant to air as part of the second season before Cartoon Network decided against it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>:
<ul><li> There's a rumor that for one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a>'s birthdays, two Disney animators drew a short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MinnieMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MinnieMouse">Minnie Mouse</a> (or alternatively, Snow White and other Disney characters, usually the dwarfs) having sex. According to the story, Walt laughed, asked who made it, immediately fired both of them when they said it was them, and then ordered all copies destroyed (or hidden away). Whether the story is true or not is hard to figure out. Its source has been dismissed by many Disney historians and it's highly unlikely the short will ever resurface if it ever existed at all.
</li><li> A rumor that has been confirmed true is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> got fired from working at Disney. During an interview, Ellison explained that he was hired to work at Disney. However, on his first day, Roy Disney overheard him joking about making a porn film starring various Disney characters and even imitating their voices and mimicking various lewd actions. Not surprisingly, Ellison was fired that day. It's likely that various other "(Insert name here) was fired from Disney for porn" are misheard variants of the interview.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a long-standing rumour (included for a while on this very site's page on the show) that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFonzAndTheHappyDaysGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFonzAndTheHappyDaysGang">The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang</a></em> was originally developed as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, and that when negotiations with the BBC fell through, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> threw in the <em>Happy Days</em> characters and created Cupcake and Mr. Cool as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captains Ersatzes</a> for the Doctor and K9. Eventually, the show's main writer <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbr.com/tv-legends-revealed-was-doctor-who-replaced-in-a-cartoon-by-fonzie/">denied it when asked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, saying that the time travel concept was invented simply to make the show distinct from the original live-action series and that he didn't think that Hanna and Barbera had even heard of <em>Doctor Who</em>.
</li><li> Another Wikipedia edit around the same time (though, on the American English Wikipedia) had someone claim there were more episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> with Jon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">(created for the series)</a> niece Sharon in them, and that she was removed from the series in the later seasons and had her episodes edited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">because nobody liked her.</a> Asides from this being a potential slam at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyElmyraAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyElmyraAndTheBrain">Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain</a></em>, it would be borderline impossible to cut her out of certain episodes <em>where she was the main protagonist alongside Garfield</em>, and many of these episodes she was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedCharacterFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedCharacterFic">simply had her taking the place of Jon or Odie themselves in the 'edits'.</a> Again, kinda obvious.

You'd think they would have caught on by now when the first news of it came out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April 1, 2014</a>.
</li><li> There is a screenshot of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode circulating around the internet that shows Dipper and Mabel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos">the Slender Man</a> watching from behind. The screenshot is actually fake; viewing the episode itself yields no Slender Man. Creator Alex Hirsch would actually comment on this in one interview, noting that one of the first times he overheard someone talk about the show after its premiere was a child telling someone that this rumor was true.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a>:</em>

Show creator Craig Bartlett repeatedly debunked this, as they never intended Pigeon Man to commit suicide. Another rumour is the Pigeon Man flying away with his pigeons actually being suicide, which is likewise false for both the previous reason and his appearance in the sequel movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">The Jungle Movie</a></em>.

While his face was never depicted on the show, there <em>was</em> an action figure of Dr.Claw which, obviously, had a face (although the creators cleverly put a paper barrier in the package covering his face so you would have to buy the toy in order to see it). His face is also briefly visible in the Inspector Gadget game for the Super Nintendo, although the rather low resolution makes it hard to make out.

It is rumored that whoever holds control over this long-running hoax maintains several dozen accounts throughout the web, including information sites and art galleries, all under different or similar names.

</li><li> Prior to the airing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">"Skeletons in the Closet"</a>, the episode was widely believed to focus on Zuko's life after the Hundred Year War through flashbacks.

Supposedly, when broadcasting resumed after the war, the BBC resumed the programme at the exact point it was interrupted. While the cartoon was indeed the last programme shown by the BBC before the suspension, it was aired in its entirety both in 1939 and again on the day the BBC resumed broadcasting in 1946. The urban legend arose from a 1984 documentary about the wartime BBC in which the cartoon was interrupted for dramatic reasons, causing quite some viewers to believe that this was the actual 1939 footage of the Mickey Mouse broadcast.

However, given that there are no other sources, and no known concept artwork or script material available from this, it may very well be made up.

It got to the point where both creators had to debunk it themselves and even made a joke or two about it on Twitter.
</li><li> An older one, in the same vein of the previous one, said there was an interview where the creators confessed that Candace was named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">in tribute to</a> Candace Newmaker, a girl who was accidentally murdered in a "rebirthing session" (basically an old therapy tactic that is very, very lethal). Considering the lack of proof of the interview existing anywhere, and that the show was still being pitched before the accident, this one was sort of obvious.
</li><li> Another infamous rumor claimed that Doofenshmirtz was Phineas and Candace's biological father, and there was a lost/cancelled episode that confirmed it. This was also stated to be false by the creators.

One rumor was that he would try to tear down Shining Time Station to build a highway, and some sources corrupted his name as "Pete Boom".

</li><li> Whether or not scenes from the script including George the steamroller and Cranky the crane were ever filmed.

It is unknown if this film is true or not, but it did sound like he was telling the truth. If this film is true, then it might've fallen into obscurity and might've been easily forgotten. A possible theory to this might've been that either he was one of the test audiences that watched the director's cut of <em>Thomas and the Magic Railroad</em>, or he saw a screening of the 1997 test footage that was edited into one whole film.

There exists a clip of his narration of "Gordon Takes A Shortcut", and he can be seen narrating lines for "Best Friends" and "Thomas Puts The Brakes On" on a featurette on <em>The Great Discovery</em> DVD, but it is unknown if he narrated more Season 12 episodes, since he left the show after <em>The Great Discovery</em> came out, and Brandon and Angelis ended up narrating the season anyways. Rumors say that he left due to scheduling conflicts with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MammaMia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MammaMia">Mamma Mia!</a></em>, or because he disliked the transition from models to CGI.

An awkwardly placed transition that happens after Squidward gets injected with the snail plasma which then immediately cuts to Gary, SpongeBob, and Squidward on the fence as snails was often used as evidence that a scene was cut. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSH1jHvgX6Y">a recording of the original airing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> debunked this rumor.

</li><li> Rumors exist that the original airing of "Hooky" featured a dead fish being strung up by his shoes. This has been debunked by a storyboarder.

Of course, the dialogue is fabricated.
</li><li> It's believed that in the original airing of "Life of Crime", rather than saying "No more getting mail", SpongeBob said "No more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">getting nailed</a>." and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">it cut to Patrick hammering a nail into his head</a>.

However, as proven by original tapings of the first airing, this is flat out completely untrue, with the episode always having the early cutoff even on its premiere broadcast (never mind that not having the cutoff - which would've revealed the <em>secret</em> Krabby Patty formula - would've completely ruined the joke).
</li><li> In a real-world example rather than in relation to fictional content, there were legends circulating in the early 2000s about a small child being drowned in the sea after jumping off a ship, or swimming off a beach, in the hope of "meeting SpongeBob". No evidence of this incident exists.

</li></ul></li><li> In a similar vein to the "As Seen on TV" example above, there is a legend stating that in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, Grandpa Lou came back from a game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a>, and when asked if he won, responded with "You don't know what Russian Roulette is, do you?"

The Russian Roulette dialogue is actually from an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>.
<ul><li> A rumor that Japanese movie studio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toho">Toho</a> sued <em>Rugrats</em> studio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo">Klasky-Csupo</a> in 2002 over Reptar's similarities to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, causing the character to appear less often over the show's run, had emerged in 2014 when it was inserted to the Wikipedia article on <em>Rugrats</em> episodes and somebody presented it as a fact on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a>. The rumor has since been kept alive on social media and was even incorporated as a <a class="urllink" href="https://screenrant.com/rugrats-nicktoons-toho-godzlla-reptar-similar-lawsuit/">pop culture story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenRant">Screen Rant</a> five years later. Especially suspicious as there is a lack of a docket number and early-2000s news coverage for the alleged lawsuit, not to mention the Reptar merchandise that have been sold after the show's run.
</li></ul></li><li> It was once claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HappyMonsterBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HappyMonsterBand">Happy Monster Band</a></em> would premiere a third season in 2014. However, given that the show aired from 2007 to 2008, and that there are no screencaps of any Season 3 episodes, it's likely fake; didn't stop someone from making IMDb descriptions for the fake season's episodes, though.
</li><li> There is a notorious urban legend to the effect that the classic British children's pirate cartoon series <em>Captain Pugwash</em> had characters whose names were offensive sexual puns of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloSailor">Hello, Sailor!</a> variety, like "Master Baytes", "Roger the Cabin Boy" and "Seaman Staines". In the early 1990s, the show's creator won libel damages from two British newspapers for repeating the legend. Comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorLewisSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorLewisSmith">Victor Lewis-Smith</a> has claimed that he started the legend in a comedy routine, although other people claim to have heard it much earlier. Except for Pirate Willy, the characters names are incorrect in the urban legend (for example, Master Baytes was really "Master Mate").
</li><li> A rumor that was once on this very wiki was that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OggyAndTheCockroachesTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OggyAndTheCockroachesTheMovie">Oggy and the Cockroaches: The Movie</a></em> the three cockroaches not only were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">Suddenly Speaking</a> but in the English dub they were voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattHill">Matt Hill</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelVincent">Samuel Vincent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonySampson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonySampson">Tony Sampson</a> (the same voice actors as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">the Eds</a>). All of this was proven false.
</li><li> There was once a rumor on this wiki that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales">Dragon Tales</a></em> creators made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> video special for adults called "Too Hot For TV!" where one of the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap">expresses disgust at the idea</a>. No evidence of this special exists, and all the examples mentioning it were promptly deleted.
</li><li> Nick has season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends">Making Fiends</a></em> somewhere but won't release the episodes. In reality, the episodes were never finished. They were only scripts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several rumors concerning potential future seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> exist, such as an episode where Rio finds out that Jem and Jerrica are the same person or an episode where Rapture is confirmed as LGBT. Neither is true.
</li><li> There's a myth that the reason the series changed to its second intro (which uses a more generic theme lifted from the toy commercials) is because of a potential lawsuit. The myth goes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits">The Misfits</a> threatened to sue because the intro features the fictional band known as The Misfits singing "But we're the Misfits/Our songs are better/We are the Misfits, and we're gonna get her".
</li></ul></li><li> There are many who believe that in the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphTheRedNosedReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphTheRedNosedReindeer">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a></em>, the Abominable Snow Monster had a toothache that Hermey cured, instead of Hermey simply ripping out the Bumble's teeth. While the special has been edited multiple times in various airings over the years, there is no evidence of the Bumble ever having a toothache and is most likely just the result of false childhood memories (also known as the Mandela effect).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>: It's widespread in the fandom that Ember's official backstory has been confirmed by someone who worked on the staff: she was a bullied girl who was killed in a fire. Not only is this backstory contradicted by the lyrics to "Remember", but it's an unsourced (and most likely false) rumor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early 2000s, rumors spread of a lost episode of the show, "Episode 29", which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a> during season three that featured Henry and June saying goodbye to the audience, and ending with June kissing Henry. The rumors also stated that after the show was renewed for a fourth season, Nick pulled the episode from reruns. Many fans believed this rumor for a long time due to the show itself having several episodes missing online (up until the mid-2010s), half of the series skipped on Nicktoons, and the show not being rerun often and having no home media releases. Many fans even claimed to have seen the episode when it aired. It all turned out to be false when the entire series was eventually found and uploaded online, the rumor beginning from an anonymous user posting the "episode"'s information on IMDb and Wikipedia in 2003, and Mark Marek, who did the Henry and June segments, confirming that June didn't have any romantic feelings for Henry and vice versa. Fans who claimed to have seen the episode turned out to just be misremembering other episodes of the show and getting confused and one "screencap" which surfaced online around 2015 turned out to have been edited.
</li><li> Rumors also existed of unaired (or unfinished) fifth and sixth seasons of the show, including detailed episode information. Mark Marek confirmed that no seasons were planned after season four.
</li><li> Several episodes of the show ended up skipped when the show reran on Nicktoons, and rumors popped up as to why they were skipped, including that some episodes were banned by Nick for content they didn't like (which was true for certain episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>). The skipped episodes were only missing from the Nicktoons run due to copyright issues with the <em>Lava</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngelaAnaconda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngelaAnaconda">Angela Anaconda</a></em> segments, and only one episode ("I Just Don't Get It") was outright banned due to content in the episode's <em>Action League Now!</em> segment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">that was considered too similar to the 9/11 attacks.</a> Other episodes that were missing despite not having any segments with legal issues are just assumed to have been skipped due to either Nick not being able to locate the tape masters or just by accident.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFantasticFour1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFantasticFour1978">The Fantastic Four (1978)</a></em>: It's been a long-standing rumor that the reason that The Human Torch was not included in this series and replaced by H.E.R.B.I.E was because nervous executives were afraid that children would set themselves on fire trying to emulate the Torch. The rumor wasn't helped by a 1986 issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> where Johnny Storm has to face the fact that a child in story died doing just that. In reality, the reason that The Torch was axed (also, it's theorized, being removed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpidermanAndHisAmazingFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpidermanAndHisAmazingFriends">Spiderman And His Amazing Friends</a></em> in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Firestar</a>) was that the rights to the Human Torch had been licensed separately from the rest of the Fantastic Four and so they legally couldn't include him.
</li><li> TVTome was well-known for having many false listings of this kind on their website. They included the following:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> was rumored to have a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> episode titled "<a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040703220426/http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-2593/epid-249713">Stitch Night<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which supposedly had a scene where Mickey complains about Stitch's behavior, setting up an inexplicable cameo by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">the Hamburglar</a> ("voiced" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker">Frank Welker</a>), who has noting to do with Disney (unlike many other cameo characters). Another listing claimed that there would be another crossover episode, this time with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>. It turned out that the latter episode was submitted by <a class="urllink" href="https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/digimon-mickey-mouse-o_o.3329581/page-2">a fan of the show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who was frustrated about the huge amount of fake episode listings on TVTome.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a> as guest-stars was also listed on the site.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040503214542/http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/GuidePageServlet/showid-4227/epid-191748">had a listing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for an episode called "The Ringletts", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">focusing on minor character Roxanne</a>.
</li><li> PCMag editor Jordan Minor <a class="urllink" href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/how-i-used-lies-about-a-cartoon-to-prove-history-is-meaningless-on-the-internet-6c88bcbc62d7">admitted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to writing a large number of fake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks">Street Sharks</a></em> episode summaries for TVTome back in middle school, which were blindly copied by more reputable sources until they were just accepted as fact. The two most notable examples involved an episode with Streex's sister Roxie becoming a Street Shark via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Emergency Transformation</a>, and a multi-episode story arc involving a villain named Meathook, voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWinkler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWinkler">Henry Winkler</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> fame. Both characters were created whole-cloth by Minor, but that didn't stop internet users from swearing up and down that they'd seen "the episode with the girl Street Shark", or cracking jokes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowTheMightyHaveFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowTheMightyHaveFallen">how Winkler had fallen so far</a> that he was voicing characters in a cheap <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantSamuraiWombats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantSamuraiWombats">knockoff</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> At one point, Wikipedia listed an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Oswald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Oswald">Oswald</a></em> episode that was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> called "Spooky-Pooky-Doo" on several filmographies of Scooby-Doo voice actors, including a claim that it was the final television role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman">Mary Kay Bergman</a>.
</li><li> For a long time, it was believed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CartoonAllStarsToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CartoonAllStarsToTheRescue">Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</a></em> wasn't re-aired because the producers never got permission from Jim Davis to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a> in the show, and he threatened litigation if it ever aired again. However, Mark Evanier (head writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>) has debunked the rumor, and explained the original plan which got the copyright holders to cooperate specified limited airings.

<ul><li> There is a common rumor that different cisgender female celebrities are "actually" intersex or transgender. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ciara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ciara">Ciara</a> are commonly mentioned, although this has been rumored about people as varied as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox">Megan Fox</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> and even former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama.

</li><li> There were also rumors of a variation of the Turner Entertainment Co logo with no planet and a variant of the second Saban logo with no coin. Even though someone recalled seeing the Turner variant at the end of an animated film, the variant was debunked after years of unnoticing, while the Saban variant was debunked very quickly.
