<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, Sōsuke is a <em>lousy</em> liar.

Interestingly enough, however, when he's lying to a corrupt policeman who's actually <em>trained</em> in interrogating people, he actually manages to convince him about his phony background story (wanting to fight in the Yami Battle for money and power, and also to buy back a prostitute in Tokyo).

Chachamaru is also incredibly bad at lying when trying to evade answering a question.

<ul><li> In the recent Tournament Arc, Luffy was supposed to conceal his identity while fighting. He wasn't simply bad at lying, but forgot he was supposed to do it every couple of minutes. Cue his new battle cry: "This is a normal punch!" It's telling that, in a universe where Paper Thin Disguises work on everyone but the person's closest friends (and sometimes even then), Luffy's denial fooled absolutely no one.

For instance, right before the "Death T" arc, Mokuba plays "Russian Roulette Buffet" with Yugi and Jonouchi, a game consisting of a spinning table, and six plates of food, two of which have poison; to which only Mokuba has the antidote. It's rigged, of course (Jonouchi is poisoned on the first spin), as Mokuba is controlling where the spin lands with a syrup bottle - and <em>empty</em> syrup bottle - next to him. This - along with his lame excuse as to why it's empty and the fact that Mokuba doesn't seem worried at all - tips Yugi off quickly to how he's doing it, and he wins by tying his Puzzle to the table for the final spin, breaking the bottle with it; having to depend solely on luck, Mokuba ends up with the second poisoned dish and loses.

<ul><li> Calvin himself. His lies tend to outrageous even when you consider that he's a little kid. Trying to blame Hobbes every time he does something bad is a common one, but there are lots of others. Really, the only thing sillier than his lies is that he actually expects anyone to believe them. (As his mother said once when he tried to tell her that aliens had landed outside and were demanding to speak to her as a ploy to get her to leave the cookie jar unguarded, "just how dumb do you think I am?")
<ul><li> Part of Calvin's problems, when it comes to pinning Hobbes on his own crimes, is that from everyone else's perspective, Hobbes is an inanimate stuffed toy. Since Calvin seems to be genuinely unaware that others see his friend this way, the futility of shifting the blame completely goes over his head.
</li></ul></li><li> Not just Calvin. Susie is a Bad Liar too. When Calvin decides to cheat on a math test by asking Susie for answers, and when she tells him 12 + 7 is "a billion," even the math-impaired Calvin senses something is up: "That's what she said 3 + 4 was."
</li><li> His dad is pretty bad too, although he <em>can</em> usually fool Calvin. One example:
<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> Dad, were there dinosaurs when you were a kid? <br/><strong>Dad:</strong> Oh sure! Your grandfather and I used to put on our leopard skins and hunt brontosaurus for all the clan rituals. <br/><strong>Mom</strong> <em>(after Calvin has left)</em>: Listen, buster, I think Calvin's grades are bad enough, don't you?
</div></li><li> The nighttime monsters that live under his bed are lousy liars too. Every time he shouts out something like "Any monsters under there?" he's sure to get several replies of "Nope!" or the like. Even Calvin is smart enough not to fall for <em>that</em>.

A series of vignettes are used to illustrate different points. One directive concerns what you do if you are caught: Deny, deny deny!. The vignette is a man (Joey Bishop) who is caught in his own bedroom by his wife (Ann Morgan Guilbert). She keeps asking him what he's doing?, what's going on?, who's that woman? He keeps answering with denials: Nothing. I don't know what you mean. What woman? All the while, the woman is getting dressed, and eventually leaves, he makes the bed and straightens out the bedroom, and finally goes to his favorite chair, lights his pipe and picks up the newspaper.

<ul><li> Gene has had so many affairs that his wife, Sherri, has long since stopped caring, and she tells her sister Marian that she puts up with it because she enjoys hearing the ridiculous lies he spins. For example, to cover up his most recent tryst with Betty, Gene claims to have been dealing with a case involving kids on crack, and when Sherri finds the phone number of party clown Claire Kane (whom Gene pulled over ostensibly for driving too slowly but really to hit on her) in Gene's pocket, Gene claims that Claire is a dangerous criminal nicknamed "the Clown".
</li><li> Betty, meanwhile, has two boyfriends going at once, Gene and Wally. She is planning a weekend away with Wally, but tells Gene she is going to Lake Tahoe to see her sister. Gene says her sister lives in Michigan, and she tries to claim this is her other sister - her "half-stepsister" Bunny. She also flips from saying the arrangement was made a week earlier to a year earlier, and avoids answering questions about what Bunny does for a living or whether she is married. Gene then asks Betty's son Chad about seeing his Aunt Bunny, and Chad clearly has no idea what he is talking about; Betty tries to claim that Chad is too young to remember Bunny.

"The Magical Place" shows Skye giving her "safe words" to use during telephone calls rather than tell a direct lie, in the hopes that this will help. It doesn't.

Tell me, is it made up? <br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Yes, it is. Augh! <br/><strong>Douglas</strong>: You see, that's the sort of trick question you want to watch for. I'll tell you a secret: the way to lie convincingly is never make something up, just tell a different truth. So, if you have to lie about where you were today, tell them where you really were last week. If you have to give a false name, use a real name you already know. Try again.

The "Truthfulness" disadvantage represents a deep aversion to lying, leading to a lack of practice and giving penalties to social skills where deception is required. The "Easy to Read" disadvantage represents very open body language, giving other characters bonuses to read <em>you</em>, including when spotting your lies (but also in other circumstances, all so long as they can see you). One is assumed to be moral, the other more physical. A character with <em>both</em> is a completely open book.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0865c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0865c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0865c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's also an "Honesty" disadvantage, which is actually about obeying the law.

As with many other examples on this page, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, but due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> setting, they once had very good reason to hide their magical abilities from the world, since they were once persecuted for it (they were blamed for the War of the Magi).
<ul><li> A more comedic example is the town of Zozo, where the first guy you meet says "Zozo? Never heard of it.", and the level's boss says "Good day, gentle folks. Can I be of service? I hate fighting, so I'd better let you pass." right before attacking you.

For example, Phelps finds a losing betting ticket that has a person's name on it, whom he had interviewed earlier. The NPC he questions tries to weasel out of his connection to the person on the ticket by saying one of the goons Phelps shot dead a moment ago is the guy he was looking for.

His bold-faced lies do work from time to time, though, since Sense Motive isn't a very widespread skill in the comic. Elan's girlfriend sums it up best:
<div class="indent"><strong>Haley:</strong> No offense, but you literally can't bluff to save your life. In fact, I think your bluffs usually endanger your life in new and exciting ways.
</div><ul><li> O-Chul is a terrible liar. It's not even that the things he says are <em>that</em> unbelievable; it's just that his world runs on gaming mechanics, and his Charisma score is atrocious, because he started as a Fighter and thought Charisma was a safe choice for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a> — which naturally turned around to bite him in the behind when he started taking levels in Paladin, a class that runs directly off Charisma.

His terrible lying skills are demonstrated in the first chapter when he tells Marcus that an imprisoned character must have escaped via lock picking. Not only was he not particularly convincing, but the key was still in the lock.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em>, Jason kidnapped Anna's supposedly unworthy boyfriend. Anna followed the trail of drag-marks to Jason's apartment and demanded an explanation.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jason:</strong> Well, we've been having a real problem with Canadian Trapdoor Alligators. They scoop you up in a sack and drag you off to their den. It's horrible. <br/><strong>Anna:</strong> I'm impressed. Somehow I thought you'd be a better liar. <br/><strong>Jason:</strong> I'm not used to having to lie to a woman I didn't wake up next to.

</li><li> Tom from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sunstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sunstone">Sunstone</a></em> has no poker face at all, meaning that Alan sees right through his attempt on behalf of Cassie to hook him up with Anne and tells him straight out "You can't lie for shit!" Though he could probably lie quite brilliantly if he didn't take such pleasure in <em>alluding to the truth</em> whenever he lies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheBoyInPinkEarmuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheBoyInPinkEarmuffs">The Boy in Pink Earmuffs</a></em>, when JJ's mom asks him how he got all scraped up, Danny says he fell on his butt, his back, his head, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">and his butt</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DHSComix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DHSComix">DHS Comix</a> has Col Skinchanger, who despite being a shapeshifter whose patron god's domain is lies and trickery, cannot lie convincingly to save his life. Thankfully most people either believe his weak lies, play along or don't care he's lying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ImTheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ImTheGrimReaper">I'm the Grim Reaper</a></em>: <em>Scarlet.</em> It's kind of a miracle she hasn't been found out yet.

I guess my first question is...are you an alien? <br/><strong>Zim:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">LIES!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">THE FILTHY EARTH BOY LIES!</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">I mean, no</a>.
</div></li><li> Beezy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>. He'll often buckle under pressure and tell people to quit interrogating him, even if they're simply commenting casually to what he is saying.
</li><li> Cotton Hill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>. To give one example, he tells Peggy numerous war stories in one episode that make him seem like a hero, but simply don't make sense when you look at them all at a whole. (One of them places him at a location hundreds of miles away from another one that, according to him, took place just a couple of days earlier.) Of course, most of the time, Cotton's perception of reality does seem to be shakey at best... Cotton is such a lousy liar that even his son Hank reluctantly admits that he's a liar, as evidenced from this line in an argument he has with his mother:
<div class="indent"><strong>Hank:</strong> Well that means that one of you isn't telling the truth! (<em>Slight pause.</em>) Oh, who am I kidding? I know it's him.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StitchTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StitchTheMovie">Stitch! The Movie</a></em>, the pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em>, Jumba tries to convince Gantu that the totally-not-an-experiment-pod is a ping-pong ball:
<div class="indent"><strong>Gantu:</strong> Where are they? <br/><strong>Jumba:</strong> They? Who they? <br/><strong>Gantu:</strong> The other six hundred and twenty-five experiments. <br/><strong>Jumba:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> You must have me confused with <em>other</em> evil genius scientist! <br/><strong>Gantu:</strong> <em>(notices a pod with "625" inscribed on it)</em> What have we here? <br/><strong>Jumba:</strong> Uh... is uh... ping-pong ball! Is Earth sport, like tennis but tinier. <br/><strong>Gantu:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">You're a bad liar, Jumba</a>. Where are the other experiment pods?
</div></li><li> Applejack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is defined by her honesty, the Element of Harmony she represents. In the second season premiere, Discord turns her into a liar, but doesn't exactly give her the skills to do it well. Every time she lies, she bites her lip and makes shifty eyes, and when she's actually speaking, she blurts it out in a manner that makes her look like the dumbest pony alive - both in facial expression and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">content</a>. She gets better at it in the next episode, at which point it's soon resolved. It certainly says a lot about a character's integrity when they have difficulty lying even when being <em>magically compelled</em> to do so.
<ul><li> Applejack doesn't need Discord's help to be a bad liar - also in Party of One, she's perhaps the only one to have a decent, plausible, ready-made excuse for not attending the party (that being that she's busy harvesting apples). It still takes her a good few seconds of gazing over the acres of farmland, buckets of apples, and "um"ing and "ah"ing before she finally manages to blurt something out.
</li><li> Apparently, it runs in the family. Apple Bloom is also a terrible liar. For example, when she was "explaining" that Granny Smith couldn't come to class because of a family emergency, she involuntarily gave a nervous smile and her eyes started shifting. Apparently, she can cross "poker player" off her list of cutie mark attributes.
</li><li> In "Party of One", the rest of the mane six have to come up with reasons why they can't attend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Pinkie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Pie</a>'s party. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy top the list by claiming they're housesitting for "Harry the Bear" who's on a beach vacation... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereoFibbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereoFibbing">playing beach volleyball/collecting seashells/collecting volleyballs/playing seashells</a>. Rainbow Dash even doodles a watch on her wrist just so she can look at it and "realize" they're late. Of course, since this is Pinkie Pie they're talking to, their excuse is the <em>one</em> excuse she accepts when she starts to put things together.
</li></ul></li><li> Phineas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> in "The Beak". He scratches his ear, stutters and giggles nervously whenever he lies in that episode, and he lies only to Isabella, for that matter.
</li><li> An entire episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> revolved around Rigby betting Mordecai that he was this, while Mordecai attempted to prove him wrong.
</li><li> In the episode "Reunion" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>, it turns out that Bow has been living a double life, telling his dads that he's studying at a made-up educational institution instead of fighting with the rebellion like he's actually been doing. When Adora and Glimmer track him down, he has to frantically coach them on the made-up backstories he gave them, and while Glimmer manages to hold it together reasonably well, Adora has trouble remembering which major he said she had, appears convinced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentUponTheWrongSyllable">scholars speak some kind of mutant version of English</a>, and so on. Nor are Bow's attempts to cover things up any more convincing.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bow:</strong> Adora has a sixth major in She-Ra?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. After being accused of toilet papering someone's house:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cartman:</strong> Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub">The Breakfast Club</a></em>, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Fritas Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS7E2ADistantEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS7E2ADistantEcho">"A Distant Echo"</a>, Captain Rex makes an unconvincing attempt to cover for Anakin when he's making a private holo-call to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Padmé</a> in the barracks. It's implied that Rex's claim that Anakin is allegedly spot-checking his gear is their regular excuse since Anakin has Rex give him his helmet before he goes inside, but it's still not good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper">Obi-Wan</a> sees straight through it, but doesn't call him on it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS1E04BreakingRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS1E04BreakingRanks">"Breaking Ranks"</a>, as part of a plan to steal an Imperial encryption module from Agent Kallus' office, Ezra's new friend Zare Leonis has the job of distracting Kallus so Ezra can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinetically</a> steal the module. Zare does this by claiming he has a delivery of <em>used podracer parts</em> for the agent. And Zare is so nervous doing it that Kallus suspects something is up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance">Star Wars Resistance</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsResistanceS1E2TheTripleDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsResistanceS1E2TheTripleDark">"The Triple Dark"</a>, Kaz, a rookie spy with pilot training but no mechanical training, who has to work as a mechanic as cover, claims to his coworker Tam that he worked as a mechanic in a factory on Coruscant that made "new ships". And, as per this trope, he's decidedly less than convincing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ruby turns out to have this trait in "Hit the Diamond", complete with sweating a lot and blurting out very unconvincing statements. Luckily, the people she's lying to are, put bluntly, so stupid they don't notice a sixth member joining their group because their leader <em>forgot to count herself</em> at roll call, so she still fools them.
</li><li> Steven is a little better, but he still cracks under pressure, especially when compared to more experienced liars, like Connie.
<div class="indent"><strong>Connie:</strong> Hey Mom. I was just finishing up my six o'clock violin practice. <br/><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Dr. Maheswaran:</a></strong> You should've been done an hour ago.

</div></li><li> Steven probably picked this up from Garnet, who has <em>psychic future sight</em> and still can't come up with a convincing thing to tell Connie's mother on the phone.
<div class="indent"><strong>Garnet:</strong> (completely deadpan) The children are playing swords. Sorry, with swords. They're bleeding. Oh no, they're dead. Don't call again. [hangs up] I panicked.

She looks away, stutters, and visibly has to fish for ideas when lying. This is made kind of hilarious by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father and sister are supervillains, and her mother is a reformed one</span>. Which is usually what she's lying about.
</li><li> Evilina in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZipiYZape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZipiYZape">Zipi y Zape</a></em> animated series.
