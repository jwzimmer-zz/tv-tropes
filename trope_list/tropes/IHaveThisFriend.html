Maybe you just wrapped dad's car around a tree, maybe you've been snorting coke, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">maybe you just opened a dimensional rift that endangers the future of humanity</a>, whatever, but nobody knows about it. Still, you can't resist the urge to find out what would happen to someone who, oh say, for instance, might have, for example, hypothetically, possibly, may have, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">kinda sorta</a>... did something really really <em>really</em> bad. Sometimes your mom/dad/friend/boss/superior officer will catch on right away, sometimes they're going to unwittingly scare you out of telling them what happened until the situation is much, <em>much</em> worse. Either way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity is likely to ensue</a>.
</p><p>That is, unless it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialBalloonQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialBalloonQuestion">Trial Balloon Question</a>, in which case there's more likely to be broken hearts and blood.
</p><p>In an interesting twist, when you do in fact have a hypothetical situation, or you actually are asking for advice for a friend, 9 times out of 10, whoever you're asking will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">assume</a> that you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">using this trope</a>. Another twist is to slip into first person before you're done describing the situation. Played for laughs, a character will describe the situation in third person and then ask for advice in first person. Played for drama, it may be made obvious that both sides are fully aware of the true nature of the situation but only feel comfortable speaking about it in third person.

Also compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsForABook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsForABook">It's for a Book</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatLittleGirlWasMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatLittleGirlWasMe">...And That Little Girl Was Me</a>, for a similar deception regarding someone's backstory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">The Confidant</a> can usually be told the non-hypothetical version without freaking out.

</p><p>And yes, this trope is <em>definitely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. It is probably more common in real life than it will ever be in fiction. If you haven't pulled this trick yourself, you'll most certainly have met someone who did. Or, if you actually <em>are</em> referring to a friend, confront the automatic presumption that you aren't. To experience it instantly, go to a forum with a userbase primarily consisting of teenagers, open some threads about problems of a sexual nature, and it will not take you many minutes to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples.

<ul><li> Commercials for medications that treat embarrassing health issues, such as incontinence or erectile dysfunction, often show the patients using this trope on their doctors, or at least thinking about it before they come clean about their "problem".
</li><li> A Keebler commercial where a girl asks the elves some cookies for "a friend".
<div class="indent"><strong>Girl:</strong> <em>[after taking a bite]</em> Thanks, I needed that. <br/><strong>Ernie:</strong> You mean, <em>she</em> needed that?

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em>, Saki tells a story about a "friend" of hers whose otaku boyfriend might have been watching anime during sex.
</li><li> Often used by Akko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends">Girl Friends</a></em> when she tries to discuss her love woes with her friends, without giving away they are about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">her and another girl, Mari</a>. The last time she used this is especially hilarious since she placed herself in the boyfriend of the friend role, leading to this exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock">Taguchi</a>:</strong> Ah... her boyfriend is a cheater and he wants to cheat on her so he won't tell her which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">university</span> he's going to, right? <br/><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">Akko</a>:</strong> <em>(glaring)</em> THAT IS NOT IT.

<ul><li> Variation: Inori tries to get Akane's opinion on the relationship between his sister Seri and Ikutidaru the Oni by referring to a hypothetical situation without names or details; predictably, Akane's answer doesn't turn out to be something he hoped for (and she figures out right away that Inori is talking about a particular person).
</li><li> Inverted to hilarious effect in one of the OAV episodes for the series. Inori believes Eisen to have stolen his good luck charm toy made by his late mother. His attempts to assure Eisen that he is okay with this initially take the form of a general statement so as to not address the quirky issue directly: well, people from powerful rich families may sometimes feel... lonely... so it's all right, Inori doesn't mind. Naturally, Eisen <em>didn't</em> take the toy and therefore fails completely to understand what Inori was talking about.
</li></ul></li><li> Hinagiku does this while watching Maria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>. Not entirely sure if Maria caught on (Maria can be unbelievably dense sometimes), but her response is dead on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, the title character isn't even willing to use the "I have this friend" method — Shippou ends up doing it for him, asking Kaede for relationship advice for "a dog I know," while Inuyasha, present for the whole conversation, denies that it has anything to do with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>, particularly given that Shippou provides visual aids. Visual aids he's so proud of that he later shows to the whole village, much to Kagome's embarrassment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>. Empress Azalyn uses this trope because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a> that she's in love with Tylor (because their planets are at war and she's an empress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">a relationship is impossible</a>) only to lose patience when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">doesn't get the hint</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tylor:</strong> Tell me more about this friend. <br/><strong>Azalyn:</strong> Well for one thing, the man that she's in love with is extremely dense!
</div></li><li> Naru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> tells the rest of the girls about a "friend" who has a chance to do their dream job and wants to know what she should do. All the girls obviously know who she's referring to and tell her to try to keep <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keitaro</span> from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">working at an excavation site</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays">Midori Days</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a> Ayase confess to Seiji this way. After detailing all the ridiculous efforts 'her friend' made to catch 'some guys' attention, Seiji casually remarks that the guy must be an idiot not to notice any of them. She makes it a little more painfully obvious, and then drops the routine entirely at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular">No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!</a></em>: Yuu falls back on this after asking Mokocchi what a certain sex act entails.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> has the female protagonist doing this in a projected online space but the trope is enforced. People go to this chatroom to ask for advice about the problems of other people and she is warned to phrase the issue as being about a friend.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em>, while asking her friends advice on how to tell someone she loves him, she tells them it's for a "friend of a friend".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both Hitomi and Millerna engage in this conversations with each other that describe their feelings and concerns about Allen. It takes both of them an <em>astonishingly</em> long time to realize just whom they are both, in fact, talking about. Millerna, to her credit, catches that Hitomi's basically repeating her earlier discussion, although it takes her a while to catch why that's important. Which the ditzy Catgirl Merle calls them both on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VisionOfEscaflowneAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VisionOfEscaflowneAbridged">Vision of Escaflowne Abridged</a></em> spoofs this with them both knowing what the other is talking about right away, and then playing with this in other forms.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WaitingInTheSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WaitingInTheSummer">Waiting in the Summer</a></em>: combines I Have This Friend with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoScenesOneDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoScenesOneDialogue">Two Scenes, One Dialogue</a> as the camera cuts back and forth between Kaito and Ichika discussing (with Tetsuro and Remon, respectively) the budding romantic feelings between "A" and "B" during the same lunch period. This 'hypothetical' scenario is illustrated in their imaginations by sock puppets who obviously represent Kaito and Ichika. As if this weren't transparent enough already, both Tetsuro and Remon realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Kanna is "C"</a> independently.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Kaguya and Shirogane seek advice from Kashiwagi and Ishigami, respectively, after an incident that happened while Shirogane was visiting a sick Kaguya. Both of them claim to be asking on behalf of a friend, but neither of the people they speak with is fooled. Ishigami lampshades it by saying that Shirogane is probably asking about himself, while Kashiwagi also realizes that Kaguya's asking about herself but doesn't say anything.
</li><li> Chapter 61 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets">The Quintessential Quintuplets</a></em> has a two-way example. First, Fuutarou tells Miku that "a guy he knows" just got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> from a girl who said she didn't want an answer, and he's completely dumbfounded about it. Miku isn't fooled and giggles, but then immediately tells him that "someone she knows" wanted to confess to a boy she liked, but chickened off at the last second. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later chapters strongly hint that he <em>did</em> realize she was talking about herself, and he was that boy she wanted to confess to</span>.

Twilight asks Celestia for some romantic advice — specifically, about her friend's romantic feelings for another mare. A regal, elegant mare who is well respected in Canterlot society. Twilight's friend doesn't want to cause her any trouble, you see. It doesn't take long for Celestia to cotton on to what's going on, and she encourages Twilight to come clean about her feelings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> at the end; Twilight really was asking for a friend, specifically whether or not Applejack should ask out Rarity.

In the first case, Sweetie Bell has a crush on Cherilee. After she asks Dinky Doo for help, Dinky asks her mom for help in turn. Unfortunately, Ditzy Doo doesn't realize that Dinky really is asking on behalf of a friend, and thinks that Dinky's confessing to a crush on her teacher. And while she knows that Cherilee would never encourage such a crush, Trixie has been teaching Dinky magic, and Trixie is known to love people's attention and adoration. So she flies out to confront Trixie. The ensuing argument ends with Dinky convinced that Trixie wasn't encouraging Dinky to have a crush on her, but it also ends with Trixie convinced that Dinky <em>has</em> a crush on her. And that's where round two comes in. Trixie goes to ask Lyra for help, but fails to specify exactly who she's talking about, only mentioning that "a unicorn" has a crush on "her teacher". Naturally, Lyra assumes that Trixie's confessing to a crush on the one who taught <em>her</em>—Princess Luna.

Some time later, Katara confronts Hakoda, and they get into an argument about "Bato" keeping "his" relationship secret from Hakoda, and Hakoda meddling in "Bato's" love life, with Katara fully aware of what she and her father actually mean.

Who is most certainly not a psychiatrist, or for that matter a psychologist. What's worse, Peter starts out talking about his actual experiences as, "I've had these dreams where I'm Spider-Man". And then says that it was actually his <em>friend's</em> dream. The doctor clearly catches on that the "friend" is really Peter (though he doesn't say anything), but mistakes the <em>reason</em> for why he's doing the routine. Peter is trying to hide the fact that he <em>is</em> Spider-Man; the doctor thinks he's embarrassed about the dreams.

The boss responds by giving Tara the name of a clinic, clearing Tara's schedule for the next day, and assuring her that she thought Tara's "friend" was making the right choice. This is both a subversion and a straight example: Tara really was asking for a friend (the stripper girlfriend of one of the Sons), but Tara was also pregnant, and her boss's response was one of the factors in convincing her to make an appointment at the abortion clinic as well.

Harvey goes to Louis with some documents given to him by "a friend at another law firm" that seem to be showing evidence of embezzlement. Louis falls for this completely and is delightful in digging through another firm's dirty laundry. He does not realize that the documents not only belong to his own firm but that they seem to show that Louis is the one doing the embezzling. He then inverts things by pointing out that the apparent embezzler is just "a shmuck" and is being set up to take the fall for the real thief. He saves himself without even realizing that all along he was talking about himself.

Midge went to talk with Kitty and said she had a friend that was a married mother who was thinking about leaving her family because she was in love with a much younger man. Kitty at first thought it was a neighbor but after Midge denied it she assumed it was really Midge going to her for advice. She told her to stick with her husband and not think about the other man, and they both agreed that the friend would do that not realizing that they thought the other was having an affair.

</div></li><li> Nathan Ausubel's <em>A Treasury of Jewish Folklore</em>:
<div class="indent">Once there was a young sinner whose conscience bothered him, but because he was vain he found it hard to confess his sins to his rabbi. So he fell on a stratagem.

He therefore recited all the misdoings of his "friend" who he said was too ashamed to appear and plead for himself. <br/>Now the rabbi penetrated his pretense, so he said to him, "What a fool your friend must be! Couldn't he come himself? After all, he could have said just what you have told me—that he had come in the interest of a friend. In that way he would have spared himself any embarrassment."
