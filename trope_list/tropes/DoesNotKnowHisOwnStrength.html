Consequently, when trying to go about your daily grind, you accidentally break almost anything in your hands from pulling or squeezing too hard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake">(that could include other people's hands)</a>. Jars and cups burst from the slightest squeeze, you burst through doors and windows, your shoulders chip at entrances/egresses and at worst, you cause severe damage to important facilities or even living beings. The toughest objects are brittle in your super-strong hands and you have to be extra delicate with how you hold or lift things. This is one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnipresentTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnipresentTropes">Omnipresent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">gags</a> in the medium of superpowers as one of the missing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> that has to be re-learned and remembered for daily functioning.

After all, in real life an Olympic athlete that can lift several times his own weight can also pick up a caterpillar without squishing it and it would create all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> to see characters with long-established super strength constantly smashing plates or bottles and not wonder how they ever managed to feed themselves without learning how to control their power. The one major exception to this is if they're from a place (whether it's another planet, an alternate reality, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a>) where everyone is that strong, so things like doorknobs and coffee cups are built to withstand being used by individuals capable of crumpling steel with their bare hands and they're not used to how comparatively flimsy everything is on Earth.

After all, incinerating enemies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">"too much fire"</a> isn't really a problem, but burning dinner with "too much fire" is.
</p><p>If the hero's family is unaware of the hero's new powers, undoubtedly the blame for the damage will fall on 'shoddy construction' or on another house member's bad attempts at DIY.
</p><p>A frequent and more realistic variation of this is that the hero is able to control one's strength, but when tempers flare or the hero is startled (or otherwise incapacitated, or perhaps inebriated) that control quickly lapses.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>: This was a major issue Astro had when Tenma was forcing him to be a replacement for his deceased son Tobio. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotKid">Robot Kid</a>, Astro couldn't act like a normal child and broke things <em>very</em> easily.

Usually at either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Japan</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">England's</a> expense.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> when Femto aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Griffith</span> first uses his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">god powers</a> to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">The Skull Knight</a> saving Guts and Casca, he holds out his hand and makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">gravity well</a> that misses the knight but crushes a group of Apostles into chunks. Femto then looks down at his hand amazed, when Guts attacks him years later Femto doesn't even uses his hands and just blows Guts away from using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a> showing how much he has mastered his powers.

Guts then finds his iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> and "neatly" slices the Apostle in two, this scene not only shows the level of weaponry you need to slay a demonic being, but it also shows Guts's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> is so high that any blade smaller than a greatsword is ill suited for him.
</li></ul></li><li> A more tragic example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a></em>. In one episode, a serial killer is hunting and murdering young women with short brunette hair and glasses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out to be a rogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Marionette</a> that escaped and is seeking the women because they have similar traits to her creator, who imprinted her with childlike affection, and she ended up killing her "Mama" and the other women by hugging them until their insides ruptured.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nel Tu temporarily returns to her true age</span>, she hugs the living crap out of Ichigo, who had previously been badly wounded while she was watching. However, what she fails to realize is that she's so strong in that form that she actually comes close to choking him. By the time Orihime makes her realize it, he passed out, causing her to worry and hug him <em>even harder</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>: Before he became a Demon Slayer, Gyomei lived a peaceful life as a priest free of conflict. However, when a demon attacked and killed several of the orphans at his temple, Gyomei retaliated with a ferocity and strength that he did not know he had in him, beating the demon's head to a bloody pulp over and over until the sun rose. He states that if it weren't for that moment, he would have lived his entire life without realizing that he possessed such incredible strength and resolve.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The very first time this trope was in effect was during the preliminary matches of the 21st tournament. Goku playfully tapped his opponent (a big, muscular man) in the back of his leg, causing the man to fall out of the ring in pain. Goku quickly told Krillin to be careful from then on. It had been a while since Goku and Krillin had fought somebody who didn't have super-strength on par with their own, after all.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episodes leading up to the Cell Games in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Goku and Gohan had this problem as Super Saiyans. Needless to say, Chi-Chi wasn't amused. The viewers were, though. This made sense, because they'd never gone through everyday, non-combat life in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan form</a> before.
</li><li> In filler late in the Cell Saga, Goku crumbles the wooden house King Kai built as soon as he lays his hand on it.
</li><li> During one of the tournaments, contestants are qualified to participate in the fight by punching a machine that registers the force delivered. Goku and his friends have to concentrate really hard to hit the machine without breaking it. Vegeta doesn't hold back.
</li><li> Before that, when Goku wants to train Gohan in preparation for the Androids, while Goku attempts to calm his wife Chi-Chi down he pats her on the back, causing her to fly through a wall and a tree. Goku was very apologetic and helped Gohan patch her up.
</li><li> An earlier filler example happens when Goku recovers from his heart illness, and he and Chi-Chi do the "happily toss into the air" bit when they reunite. Goku, momentarily(?) forgetting his own strength, accidentally tosses Chi-Chi too far (as in, too high to see). She didn't really seem to mind, probably since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoHisArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoHisArms">caught her</a> and the action reaffirms his aforementioned recovery.
</li><li> His youngest son, Goten, unknowingly achieves Super Saiyan for the first time while training with Chi-Chi. He promptly kicks her, assuming she'll still be faster than him and dodge. She's not, and flies about twenty feet into a tree. She's perfectly fine, and not the slightest bit angry, just upset that her youngest son is already an alien killing machine.
</li><li> Even Chi-Chi herself gets in on the action. In an early episode, while waiting longer than usual for Goku to return home (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">he may have been dead at the time</a>), she decides to wash the dishes.

</li><li> Zoro was plagued by this trope in his early bounty hunter days (shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>) where he'd constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon">break his other katanas</a> by using too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, so much of his early training was focusing on using the required force and nothing more.

<ul><li> Even when being careful Zoro risks killing normal dudes with his strength as when he used the flat side of his blades to knock out the Galley La Foremen and Nami warned him that's still enough to cause serious injury. Earlier on <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/2a/e7/652ae749add53495db67f21593fd6d02.jpg">Zoro split the Going Merry's mast in half while simply drawing the sails<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, though in this case it's more showing the poor condition the ship was in that it couldn't handle its superhuman occupants rather than Zoro's strength.

<ul><li> Sanji plays this straighter at other times like when he accidentally broke Namis Logpost by kicking Luffy into it, or when Sanji was on board the Sea Train and after learning what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">CP9</a> have done to Robin, he gets so enraged that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlassInTheHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlassInTheHand">he crushes a Transponder Snail's receiver in his bare hand</a>.

She first discovers her newfound strength when she casually sets her bowl down, and promptly smashes the table and the floor <strong>below the table</strong>. She would also regularly pat other characters (usually Ranma) with what was supposed to be a light touch on the head or shoulder, and instead sent them flying.
</li><li> During a mid-manga story, Ranma is weakened by a vengeful Happousai.

<ul><li> The comics version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is the primary aversion of this, where his strength is almost always played as a positive and the negatives are rarely highlighted.
<ul><li> Played straight when Supes is depicted as a child who realistically doesn't know his own strength as seen in his <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comicbookreligion.com/img/_num/18000/18225.jpg">first comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em> where <a class="urllink" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/oxFlt9n-xOprYzf_K7sc5Et4JSVX99aSJ3-Ar68MycQP0mDoJP4HvZgO-09x3vU8c00qnqq_lIsV=s1600">it serves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> for Superman later actions. A lot of writers enforce the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> where Superman only developed his superpowers at later age to avoid this trope.
</li><li> An excellent 1960s issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a></em> dealt with a villain tricking young Supes into thinking he had accidentally killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a> with a careless display of strength. Grief-stricken, Superboy turns himself in to the police and sits brooding in a jail cell, giving the villain and his mooks a free window of opportunity to commit crimes unopposed. Naturally, it's all a ruse, and Lana turns out to have been merely kidnapped and is totally unharmed.
</li><li> One story from the '90s saw Supes' strength start increasing exponentially. This trope definitely came into play then.
</li><li> Some versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KryptoTheSuperdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KryptoTheSuperdog">Krypto the Superdog</a> apply this trope. Being just a dog, he really doesn't know his own strength.
</li><li> Many, many times in various Superman comics other people would gain Superman's strength. This trope almost always applies.
</li><li> And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> classic <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.rawbw.com/~svw/superman.html">Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

</li><li> One Bronze Age story had Superman's strength seeming to increase beyond his ability to control, and he resorted to a super sunscreen to block his absorption of the sun's rays. It turned out to be a trick by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">the Parasite,</a> who was specifically leeching Superman's <em>ability to control his strength,</em> making his strength seem like it was increasing, while the sunscreen was in fact rendering him weaker and weaker. At the climax, as he's realized too late what was happening and is plummeting to his death because he can't fly any more, he removes his <em>boots</em> because he hadn't put any sunscreen on his feet, and absorbs just enough sunlight mojo while falling to survive the impact.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a>, a character named Superboy Prime (he's from the real world) attacks the DCU's Superboy, beating him badly whilst causing a huge amount of damage to the town of Smallville, until a (fairly large) group(s) of other heroes arrive as back-up. When a heroine named Pantha calls him a "stupid kid" and attacks him in which Superboy retaliates by smacking her across the face... He ends up taking her head off and killing her, he is completely shocked when he notices the blood on his hand and has a mini breakdown.
</li><li> In <em>Superman Annual #8</em>, Pounder, one of a far-future League of Supermen who have each been genetically engineered to have <em>one</em> of Superman's powers, has support staff who have to do <em>everything</em> for him, because it's not safe for him to touch things. (The whole League is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>, in fact.)

It caused problems when he tried to play football with his friends and accidentally broke Pete Ross's arm.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> does this on occasion, for example in one of Redan's <em>Batman and Superman</em> comic strips. Then again, she was still learning to control her powers. One of the explicit differences between Superman and Supergirl is that Superman has mental blocks he imposed on himself so there's an upper limit to how much power he'll use, while Supergirl has no such blocks, allowing her to at times be <em>stronger</em> than her cousin.
<ul><li> In the 1970 story "Supergirl's Lost Uniform", Supergirl while in her Linda Danvers identity lifted what she thought was a fake 500-lb weight and twirled it like a baton. The fake was the one next to it. Oops.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave">Nextwave</a></em>, the narration mentions that the Captain once knocked a man's lungs out of his chest by patting him on the back... but in his defense, he was drunk.
</li><li> The titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Concrete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Concrete">Concrete</a></em> is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> in this regard, being a half-ton stone man who doesn't dare try to hold anything breakable.
</li><li> The titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang">Monica's Gang</a></em> suffers because of this. Since she's only 6, it leads to really funny situations (although not so funny for her parents, who have to pay for the broken stuff). Jimmy Five and Smudgy feel in their skins what her inhuman strength causes, most often in the form of physical retribution for their infallible plans to "defeat" her, though she's been known to throw around the comic's Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a>. It's all in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> territory.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">JSA</a> introduced Citizen Steel, who <em>literally</em> doesn't know his own strength — the accident that gave him his powers also deadened his sense of touch, meaning he can't feel how much force he's exerting. He walks around in a costume he was <em>cast into</em> so that he can control it.
</li><li> Obelix from <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Astérix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> does seem to know his strength... he is just apparently unaware that not everyone possesses that strength, hence his failure to understand the difference between "knock on the door" and "smash the door" and why no-one around him is able to carry tiny menhirs.
</li><li> In the last issue of the Marvel MAX <em>Barracuda</em> miniseries, Barracuda pats the young hemophiliac he had been charged with turning into a cold blooded killer on the back... killing him. To be fair, Barracuda is a fucking beast of a man, but that's... dang, son.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em>, being a god-empowered superbeing stopped being fun for Osiris after he killed his sister Isis' attacker, the Persuader, by flying into him too hard.
</li><li> A lot of humour stemmed from the use of this trope in the 1970s comic strip <em>Wee Ben Nevis</em> which featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em>. This trope is also frequently used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy">The Dandy</a></em>'s most famous strip <em>Desperate Dan</em>.
</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable">Irredeemable</a></em> also fits this trope. Basically a Superman expy, in one scene where he visits one of the many sets of foster parents he had as a child, we see him feeding their severely disabled (adult) biological son. Turns out he was there the day that Jr. came home from the hospital with Mum...he just wanted to give his new baby brother a hug...

However there's a storyline where she works out like crazy to beat a much stronger opponent (she intelligently uses a quirk of her physiology which increases greatly, in her Hulk form, the effects of workout in her "normal" form). This increases her strength to the point that she breaks nearly everything she touches, until she gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> suit.

He accidentally kills a man playing football, gets fired from a manual labour job because he's making everyone else look bad, gets fired from a bank job because he saves someone from suffocating in the vault, and they want to know how he opened it...

Hoss sees potential in Arnie and tries to mentor him, but his efforts are always thwarted by Arnie's desire to marry a barmaid, Shari, who wants nothing to do with him ... and Arnie's own temper and inability to realize that, due to his tremendous strength, he can kill a man rather easily. Hoss repeatedly tries to warn Arnie that he doesn't know his own strength.

When Hoss realizes what Arnie has done, he tries to get Arnie to understand that he killed someone (and possibly a second person, too) and that he has to go to jail. Arnie then knocks down Hoss and tries to flee. When a sheriff's posse surrounds Arnie, he picks up a huge boulder and attempts to hurl it toward everybody, forcing them to gun him down.

If you take an opponent out of a conflict in the Fate system (which <em>The Dresden Files</em> uses), <em>you</em> decide — within reason — just how exactly that happens, and thus settling for a "mere" knockout blow is just about always an option unless you're dealing with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">particularly bloodthirsty GM</a>. (On the third hand, nothing whatsoever prevents a character regardless of their "technical" strength level from being created with a relevant <em>aspect</em> — which could even literally be "Does Not Know His/Her Own Strength", they're freeform that way — and playing the trope dead straight to earn fate points, be that in combat, outside it, or both.)

</li><li> Another good example is Diz Aster, who is a Brick along the same lines as Lancer - except that her telekinetic field can't produce anything <em>less</em> than 7 tons of force. This also means that she can't even <em>feel</em> anything, since her shields extend to a few millimetres past her skin; by the time Chaka starts helping out, it's been a year since anyone's been able to touch Diz — or since she's been able to touch anyone else.

Back in his football days, he was known as the "Billdozer" for his uncanny ability to just keep pushing through an opposing team's entire defensive line to make a goal. Even at his current age, he's able to pull off similar feats if the situation is dire enough, and the reason he rarely does is because he has so little self-confidence that he never really tries.

"Hey, I NEEDED that!" Unlike <em>Animated</em> Bulkhead, this version isn't clumsy but it's implied that he still heavily restrains himself because even among Cybertronians he is an abnormally big and powerful bot.

<ul><li> There's a nervous system disorder that prevents people from telling quite how much pressure they're applying to something — though unless they're ridiculously strong, it's rarely ever a problem. Or unless they're handling something light and delicate, like paper or a neurosurgical operation. Children with this condition can have serious problems when it comes to things like pencils and crayons- they can't accurately gauge how hard they're holding them so they regularly snap them. This can also cause severe difficulty in learning how to write- holding the pencil or pen too hard makes writig neatly difficult and causes significant strain on the writer's hand.
</li><li> Inverted (cruelly) with leprosy. It's not that they injure others, but that they injure themselves since their sense of touch is severely reduced. Couple that with a high rate of infections leading to gangrene and disfigurement. Thankfully <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy#Treatment">there is a cure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Far, far more prevalent is diabetes, where neuropathy (damage to nerves) combined with poor circulation lead to this, eventually resulting in a terrifying amount of preventable amputations. It's also much harder to reverse diabetes than eliminate leprosy. There are other causes of neuropathy as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Though nowhere near as extreme in fiction, can happen with some people devoid of any nervous disorders. Common with young men who are just realizing that they've suddenly gained a bunch of muscle mass.
</li><li> And athletes. It's not uncommon for water polo players to under-estimate their strength and over-estimate the other player's strength, and dunk someone/give them a nosebleed/really hurt someone without realizing it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a> was this way. He was extremely careful in the ring because of it. Unless you pissed him off.
</li><li> An example of how this can be an ACTUAL thing: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> once did an interview, where he related the story of a wrestler who once got jumped by a ringside fan.

Being part of the pre-litigious era, the man was restrained and held backstage, and after returning from the match, Hercules slapped the fan so hard he knocked the guy off his feet, into the wall, and onto the ground unconscious. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress">Cornette's group</a> was the next scheduled match, they walked over the poor fellow, had the match, returned back and he was <em>still out cold</em>.

</li><li> People who hit their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl">growth period</a> before their peers can exhibit this. Sometimes it sticks, particularly for those who end up <em>very</em> large. It can be hard to estimate just how much damage you can do when you don't work out but are still 6+ feet.
</li><li> Scientists are currently working on robots that are made of soft materials, because hard ones are not equipped to handle delicate objects. There are also efforts to measure exactly how much power it takes for a robot arm to injure people, so they can fine tune the limiters. One step in this process involved <a class="urllink" href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-10/robot-punches-humans-name-scientific-progress">building a robot arm that hits people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and asking them to rate their pain on a scale.
</li><li> Sadly, lots of small children learn this the hard way with their first pet, especially if they mistakenly try to ride a dog or a cat like a horse, which can cause serious back injuries to the pet. And on the flipside, many pets don't always realize that their humans aren't as tough as they are, causing incidents when an excited large dog knocks a child over or an energetic horse gives a playful buck that dislodges his rider.
</li><li> Individuals with frequent seizures can be abnormally strong, which is why you either get a half dozen people to help sedate one who is out of control or you have one try to gentle calm them down. This is not so much "abnormally strong" as that they don't have the natural limiters on using their strength and are instead flailing about uncontrollably. A normal person knows not to hit something that won't move, like a wall, with their full strength. A person having a seizure doesn't have that option.
</li><li> In a similar vein, many martial arts involve training yourself to shut out those limiters on cue, not unlike the effect of an adrenaline rush. A karate novice can't chop a pile of wooden boards with their bare hand because they're subconsciously holding back, which ironically is likely to result in an injured hand if they try, whereas a skilled practitioner can do it with no ill effects.
</li><li> In athletics in general someone may see their physical strength improve with regards to one specific area (like weight training) only to not realize how it translates into another sport. Thus you start playing basketball and suddenly shoot the ball over the backboard. Or a friend starts to playfully wrestle with you and you lift them off the ground.
