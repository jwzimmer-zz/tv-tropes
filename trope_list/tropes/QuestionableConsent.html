However, human emotions and relationships are complex and multifaceted, meaning that consent can sometimes be questionable. How consensual was it, really?

There are two basic ways of portraying this, although they often blend into each other.
</p><ul><li> <strong>Type A:</strong> Sure, there was consent… but how free was it, really?
</li><li> <strong>Type B:</strong> The plot would have you think consent was granted—but was it, really?
</li></ul><p>Type A applies to all kinds of situations, including sexual ones. However, many sexual examples of Type A fall under the subtrope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualExtortion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualExtortion">Sexual Extortion</a>. Type B is normally restricted to sexual situations.
</p><p>Questionable Consent can be complicated. Let's say that Alice is very rich, while Bob is very poor with starving kids. Alice wants something from Bob. Something that he really doesn't want to give her. Maybe a kidney. Or maybe unprotected intercourse with no parental rights over the resulting child. Bob very reluctantly agrees because he is desperate for money for food and medicine for his kids. But how free was his choice, really?

<ul><li> At least in the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Another">Another</a></em>, Mei is told that she has the option of refusing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to become non-existent to everyone in her class</span>. However, she's also told that if she does refuse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">any deaths that occur that year will be her fault</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em> has this occur between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marika</span> and Tamura. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marika</span> has a crush on Tamura. He has emotional trauma due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being sexually abused when he was younger</span> and has a somewhat hypersexual nature as a result, with his only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">consensual</span> sexual experiences having been unpleasant and abusive. One scene has Tamura coming onto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marika</span> in a predatory manner and he touches <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span>. They're both barely teenagers, if that, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marika</span> had limited sexual knowledge at the time. It's left vague how consensual it was, but it causes a rift in their friendship for a while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and sparks an awakening in Marika's sexuality</span>. A later chapter has the two attempting to have sex, but nothing occurs when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marika</span> becomes frightened and stops it.

Punpun is obsessed with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aiko</span> and their romance is depicted as unhealthy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Hayasaka justifies encouraging Shirogane to have sex with her fever-crazed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">mistress</a> on the basis that they're both attracted to each other when "sober". This <strong>does not work out</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirogane does nothing but is extremely discomforted when Kaguya pulls him into her bed, Kaguya is later horrified by the fear that he did do something</span>, and the whole thing blows up into a massive argument that is only resolved when both parties apologize to each other.

Notably, even when they do start dating- several months after the incident- they still don't want or feel ready to have sex, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">because attraction has nothing to do with maturity</a> and wanting to kiss someone does not necessarily mean you want to fuck them.
</li><li> In <em>Magical Girl Raising Project</em>, People are asked if they want to become real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a>, but they're not told that there's no backing out of being one. If they're forced to quit — or attempt to quit — they'll die of a heart attack because their body can't take the stress of having their powers removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> has a non-sexual example. Kyubey only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">contracts</a> children who agree to become magical girls. <em>However</em>, he does not tell them (all of) what being a magical girl entails, he uses emotional abuse to browbeat them into agreeing, and he often propositions girls who will die if they don't contract (such as a crash victim who is bleeding out on the highway).
</li><li> This is played deliberately in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> several times, mostly for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>.
<ul><li> The paramount example is the relationship between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Akio and Anthy</a></span>, since the audience is initially led to believe at first that it's consensual and both parties seem happy with the relationship; it's only after one scene in particular <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Akio rapes Anthy when she hesitates to come to him</span> that it becomes clear that it's really not, and in fact is almost literally<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u5o4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u5o4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u5o4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to the point that people have actually run it through a checklist used by professionals and hit pretty much every point</span> a case study for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>.
</li><li> This is also present in the infamous episode 33, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akio takes Utena's virginity</span>, leading to an extremely uncomfortable and awkward scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're never <em>fully</em> shown having sex (we only see Utena from the shoulders up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">babbling and later moaning</a>), but the results are rather obvious by the time it's all done</span>.
</li><li> And yet again with most of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akio's</span> relationships due to the vast age differences between the parties, meaning that even <em>with</em> consent, most of them would be considered rape in real life.
</li><li> And in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akio has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> when he realizes that Anthy — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">who he'd thought was unconscious was awake for at least part of while he was raping her</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">slipping her drugs in her drink</a>.

</li><li> The light novel also has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Touga having sex with Miki, with extremely dubious consent present throughout the entire scene</span>.

The protagonist, Kirishima Ran, is given a transmigration skill [Sexual Lunatic] that makes any female fall madly in love with him if he touches her. The women who fall under his charm in this manner inevitably become unbelievably horny and come on so strongly they don't take "no" for an answer, even though he <em>never</em> orders them to have sex with him, they know they're charmed, and they <strong>like it!</strong>

</li><li> This was the cause of <em>major</em> backlash when the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHoodAndTheOutlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHoodAndTheOutlaws">Red Hood and the Outlaws</a></em> showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Starfire</a> as an amnesiac and unable to remember individual humans' faces, which made the fact that she then slept with Roy Harper pretty iffy. Two later attempts at an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> both failed for similar reasons: First, it was shown that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">an act</a>, but it still means that Roy didn't come out looking good since he slept with her even while thinking that she was amnesiac. And then it was <em>further</em> clarified that Roy believed that if he left, then she'd forget him, which adds a whole other level of Squick, as it's essentially putting a very lonely person (in this case Roy) in a position where the only way to keep one of their two friends is to never leave them. It probably wouldn't have gone well if Roy had wanted to end the relationship but retain a friendship.

This falls flat when one remembers that Terra is 16 at the time while Slade is significantly older, and Terra honestly seems to think he loves her, meaning that rather than showing how evil she is, it instead comes off as her being a young, confused girl who's being played by a<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2o53b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2o53b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2o53b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">possible, depending on the state</span> rapist who wants to murder her teammates. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">cartoon</a> version of this storyline, aside from being significantly sanitized for younger audiences, actually addresses this trope by showing their version of Terra as a confused, lonely girl who clearly is manipulated into evil actions, and just how freely she's committing those acts is actually discussed and used as a point of drama.
</li><li> The infamous issue #200 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, in which Ms. Marvel is written out of the book by being kidnapped, brainwashed, and raped, and then happily waltzing off with the guy who did it to her. That's not what was intended, of course, but somehow it slipped Jim Shooter's mind that the guy using a mind control machine on her meant her consent was nothing of the kind. The next time Carol appeared as written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> was an issue-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> she directed at the Avengers for standing by while the guy who did that to her explained exactly what he had done.
</li><li> Not even sexual, but let's just say that the God(dess) of Stories incarnation of Loki is very bad at this whole consent thing. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard">example</a>, it's one thing assuming that your best friend trusts you and would be okay with you trying to save her. But if she's also willing to tell you their life story… she sure as Hel would like to have a warning before you use that story to turn her into magical jewellery to accomplish that goal.
</li><li> Although it's usually danced around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23">X-23</a> is indeed a victim of this, when she's first introduced to the comics as a prostitute in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NYX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NYX">NYX</a></em>. Her age is never stated, but later books suggest she was no older than 15-16, meaning that she was <em>very</em> much unable to provide consent under New York law. Even ignoring her age, there is her mental and emotional state to consider: However Zebra Daddy got his hooks into her, by the time he did, she was an emotionally broken girl who was forced to leave her only family, suffered severe physical and emotional abuse all her life, and has been violently conditioned for subservience and obedience to the point she <em>honestly</em> doesn't understand how to make choices for herself. Laura would later confide in others that at the time Daddy found her, she didn't even comprehend that her body was her own. By <em>no</em> stretch of the imagination would she be considered mentally or emotionally capable of providing informed consent, even if she were to have sex with someone her own age.

Cassandra's girlfriend Sadie initiates the couple's first real sexual contact (undressing Cassandra and playing with her breasts) while constantly asking if Cassandra is comfortable, which she always replies yes to. The mucking comes when one remembers that Cassandra has had no sexual experience and very little education, suggesting she's not entirely aware of what she's getting herself into. <em>Further</em> complicated by the fact that Sadie has been lied to about Cassie's background and thinks she has had a standard childhood and education and just can't speak English well due to being raised overseas.

As her tribe has basically raised her to see herself as belonging to anyone forceful enough to take her, she treats the protagonist as her new master from then on and doesn't try to run away again.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ObserveAndReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ObserveAndReport">Observe and Report</a></em> plays this for very black comedy. Ronnie and Brandi's date ends with the drunken Brandi seemingly passed out, with puke on her pillow and Ronnie pumping away on top of her. This looks like a straight case of date rape, but when Ronnie starts to slow down, she mutters, "What are you stopping for?" Given the fact that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a>, Brandi might very well have been up for it, but the fact that she's <em>that</em> drunk still makes her consent questionable.

While she seems fine with this, it also doesn't look like she knows what sex even <em>is</em> exactly, pushing him off her after he apparently ejaculates to examine herself. Thus, it seems doubtful that she actually knew what was going on. So from either of their perspectives, it's problematic. Further complicating this in the other direction is the fact that one can be reasonably sure he wouldn't have had sex with her if he actually knew she's an alien who's already killed several men via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">Honey Trap</a>, meaning that since his willingness to have sex with her is based on her knowingly deceiving him about her true identity, she would be committing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByFraud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByFraud">Rape by Fraud</a> if she was acting deliberately.

A billionaire offers a couple one million dollars for one night with the wife, who has already turned down his advances earlier in the film. At this point, the couple is broke, having blown all their money on a venture to Las Vegas to try and <em>make</em> money (which they initially did before foolishly deciding to return to the casino and make even more, rather than quitting while they were ahead). After much discussion, they decide to go ahead with it. The billionaire takes the wife to his yacht, but sensing her discomfort with the arrangement, offers to flip a coin and release her from the deal if she wins. However, he wins, and… cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot">Sexy Discretion Shot</a>. It's obvious that at no time does she want to sleep with this guy but does so only out of desperation and some twisted sense of obligation. And even worse, later in the film, it turns out that the coin in question was rigged, meaning that the billionaire would have won no matter what, and making his actions look really sleazy in hindsight.

She appears to consent to sex afterwards, which begs the question: did she give consent under duress, which wouldn't make it consent at all, or was it that she wasn't fighting him but her attraction to him and she finally let her guard down?

One episode delves into the question of whether a man lying to a woman about his identity in order to get her into bed counts as rape (i.e. the woman agreed to have sex with the false identity, not the man wearing it). Naturally, Olivia claims that it does, while at least one of the "victims" simply points out that it was a game that she lost, fair and square.

</li><li> Angelic possession, in general, can be considered a form of this, as angels require humans' permission to possess them, but it's clear that the vessels are not always fully informed about what exactly the possession entails, and it's <em>not</em> clear exactly what sort of liberties possessees anticipate angels will take with their bodies. In a season five episode, Castiel considers having sex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(although ultimately doesn't)</span>, but makes no mention whatsoever of his vessel Jimmy's opinion on the matter. Apparently, Castiel's interpretation of Jimmy's permission is that he has been given complete autonomy to do whatever he pleases while within Jimmy's body, but Jimmy is a married man and it's not known if he would agree to his body being used for sex. Although Castiel spent what appears to be a couple of days discussing the possibility of being a vessel with Jimmy before permission was given - it may be that he spelled out his possession would give him the right to do <em>anything</em> while in control.

He first orders her to undress, then manually stimulate him before having sex with her. In no case does he seem to care what Dottie thinks, and though she complies it's dubious that he'd care. She may also may well be intimidated by the fact he's a hitman, and feel afraid to resist or object to this. Her attitude is hard to read, but Dottie never shows much discernible enthusiasm. Joe also says she's his "down payment" for the hit, with a huge implication of legal entitlement (i.e. he wouldn't take "no" for an answer from her).

She's pretty upset by the whole thing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a>,</em> it's eventually revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Visser One</span> and another human-Controller had twins through a pair of human hosts. The hosts, Allison Kim and Hildy Gervais, were apparently also in love with each other, and all four consider themselves the kids' parents in some sense. Since this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">supposedly</a> a kid's book, we don't get much information on the actual conception, or even what kind of relationship Allison and Hildy had before they became Controllers.

When she threatens to scream or ring the bell, he gently reminds her that she wouldn't since the mere presence of a man in her room (innocent or not, bidden or not) would destroy her reputation and marital prospects. While she does eventually give in, and later claims that he was her lover, there really isn't much consent in the original scene.
</li><li> In the 2017 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>, Janey-E has sex with Cooper believing him to be her husband.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, Barney's numerous conquests are based largely on deception. Of the over two hundred women he's slept with, he has bedded three (Quinn, Nora, and Robin) by being himself. All of Barney's sexual partners consented, but almost none consented with a full understanding of who he was and what his intentions were. Also, given that most of the women he has sex with are shown to be comically unintelligent and gullible, and some appear to be mentally unstable, he is clearly taking advantage of them, even if he isn't coercing them into sex.

Between that and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">very meek personality</a>, he fears that she may have just gone along with it because she was afraid to say no, and gets the idea that he might have raped her because he misinterpreted her feelings. However, it's a subversion. Hanako later explains that she wanted to have sex with him — although she didn't manage to express it properly because of her anxiety — and what they did was actually consensual the whole time. Furthermore, if you rewatch that scene, Hisao asks her permission before each activity he initiates, and she gives him some kind of implicit or nonverbal consent each time. It also becomes clear that Hanako deliberately brought Hisao to her room <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsARiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexAsARiteOfPassage">for that purpose</a>. It just happened that neither of them was really ready for it.

One of the H-scenes involves Hisao having sex with Hanako while she is drugged on medication. It instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">leads to a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> where Hanako gets upset and Hisao accidentally trips backwards, breaking his neck.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HashtagBlessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HashtagBlessed">#Blessed</a></em>: Joanna "consented" to taking part in an ancient prophecy involving choosing one of seven gods to impregnate her, simply by swiping right on a weird profile in a dating app. Should have read the EULA first. That being said, after the contract itself is set in stone, she has full authority on how the dating works and how she will choose. Furthermore, the gods didn't even get a theoretical option to consent—they were all simply chosen by fate and informed that if the contract was broken, everyone involved would die.
</li><li> This trope is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Megatokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a></em> where Kimiko, the voice actress for a character in an <em>eroge</em> light novel, brings up that the situation in the novel she's voicing comes off as being emotionally manipulative and taking advantage of a girl who's not in a right state of mind. Her concerns are pretty much dismissed as being part of the industry and what the audience wants from the game.
