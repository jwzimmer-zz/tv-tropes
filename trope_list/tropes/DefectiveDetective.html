The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> detective and his descendants have terrible luck with women, who either end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse">dead</a>, broken or distant; if he has a wife he may be cheating on her. And gods help him and his friends if some of the bad guys or associates that they helped put in the clink come back to haunt him.
</p><p>In short, it's rare to have a detective as a main character in a dramatic story and have them <em>not</em> have at least one serious character flaw that's tangential to them actually working cases.

Inspectors are not exempted from this and when their Psycho-pass goes high due to the amounts of stress, they'll eventually get demoted to Enforcer. For examples:
<ul><li> Shinya Kougami used to be an Inspector until his Psycho-pass exceeded into high level when he saw the corpse of his Enforcer, Sasayama, and eventually got demoted.

</li><li> Shuusei Kagari diagnosed as a latent criminal at the age of 5. Given how latent criminals are treated, he has lived his entire life in rejection from society, and the resulting sullen resentment towards the Sibyl System.
</li><li> Yayoi Kunizuka used to be a former guitarist until her Psycho-pass exceeded into high level and was placed in a institution. She decided to become an Enforcer when someone she knew turned out to be a rebel against the Sibyl System.
</li><li> Nobuchika Ginoza resents his father who became a latent criminal while his former partner, Kougami, got demoted. As the series goes by, he regularly visits his psychiatrist who warned him about his rising Psycho-pass rate.

<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> confirmed this is true in the Diniverse as well. A villain tries to manipulate Bruce Wayne by using subsonics to simulate his subconscious. It is revealed that this didn't work because the "subconscious" referred to itself as Bruce. Apparently, this isn't the name Mr. Wayne calls himself in his own head and he realized it was a fake immediately.
</li><li> As of the One Year Later storyline, Bruce realizes how fundamentally screwed up this is and is trying to strike more of a balance between his two lives.
</li><li> This interpretation has only been valid since the mid-80s (i.e., more or less since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>).

However, the drug use stops when he takes on an interesting case, his eccentricities are only a small part of the story, and never get in his way while solving a crime. (The legacy of the character is perhaps a bit different— his personality defects are severely played up in many of the <em>many</em> adaptations to be found in the Film and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV">Live-Action TV</a> sections.)

Wolfe is shown to be able to have the will to overcome all these flaws when solving crime.
<ul><li> In fact, Wolfe arguably inverts this; he's at his happiest being an eccentric, slightly kooky shut-in and and one of his great peeves is having to work. Rather than his eccentricities getting in the way of his solving crimes, Wolfe in fact tends to view the situation as people making him solve crimes getting in the way of his eccentricities.

<ul><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a> is that Dirk is <em>accidentally</em> a highly competent detective, having created the entire notion of Holistic Detection in order to provide an explanation for submitting all-encompassing expense reports to his clients. He always solves the case, but his motivation is less about Justice, Closure, or Solving The Unsolvable, and more along the lines of "I want to do whatever I like, and get someone else to pay for it all." The TV Adaptation of the first book leaned very heavily in this direction, and gave Dirk some interesting new flaws.

</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fatherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fatherland">Fatherland</a></em>, set in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">alternate universe</a> where Nazi Germany won WWII, Kripo investigator Sturmbannführer Xavier March is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">socially isolated</a>, rather taciturn workaholic, with hardly any social contacts except for two friends (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of whom turns out to be a betrayer at the novel's end</span>), a marriage in total shambles (his wife either divorced or separated, which is not made clear in the novel, but living with another man at any rate) and a son who hates him - being a fanatical young Nazi while March is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">utterly disillusioned with the regime and the ideology</a>, actively resisting Party membership, not participating in any "national events" and being a borderline dissident. As if that were not enough, he seems to have a mild (at least) case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">PTSD</a> from his service in the war and some unresolved father issues, seeing as his father -like March- had been in the Kriegsmarine and had died at sea, with March feeling pressured to follow in his footsteps. Nevertheless, he seems to be one of the best investigators the Kripo has, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">"cunning of a fox"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">a determination that seems to border on the maniacal</a>.

</li><li> In the novel <em>Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu</em>, Lee Goldberg takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by having Monk during the titular Blue Flu working with three other detectives who have been involuntarily retired — each bonkers in a different way, and each with his or her minder. Natalie finds that their issues make Monk look normal. It should be noted that the mayor hired these four (Monk and the other three detectives) because of the labor shortage. And Natalie only needs to see one look at Monk to realize that the reason the mayor wants him to lead them is because even if he doesn't know them, he probably understands their troubles better than anyone else (besides their shrinks).
<ul><li> They are Jack Wyatt, a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">like detective</a> with anger management problems who was fired after the city lost a number of lawsuits caused by his tactics. His anger management counselor Arnie is his helper. Wyatt uses these effectively in that we see him lead a SWAT team raid to capture a serial killer without any difficulty.
</li><li> Then there's Cynthia Chow, a paranoid schizophrenic who sees conspiracy theories everywhere, who was relieved of her badge due to her condition getting pretty severe. Her "curse" becomes a "gift" in that it allows her to tie together seemingly unrelated cases. Jasper Perry, her shrink, is her helper.
</li><li> Also, there is Frank Porter, an ex-detective helped by his granddaughter Sparrow, who has senility issues.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrThorndyke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DrThorndyke">Dr. Thorndyke</a> was written as a very deliberate aversion of this trope according to his author R. Austin Freeman, who felt that the trope had become overused, clichéd and exaggerated in many authors inspired by Sherlock Holmes. Thorndyke is a brilliant but humble and pleasant man whose only vice is a particularly disgusting variety of cigars.

At the start of the series this has caused his relationship with his wife to deteriorate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>, by status of being a sociopath who has to fake social skills, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillerKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillerKiller">Serial-Killer Killer</a> in his spare time. Angel, Deb, pretty much everyone Dex works with to some extent, actually, also fall into this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> The central character is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>. He's a detective with obsessivecompulsive personality disorder, along with a plethora of smaller issues like a laundry list of phobias orbiting it. (Occasionally other characters and the promos even call him "the Defective Detective"). In the Russian dub, the name of the show is <em>The Defective Detective</em>!
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Captain Stottlemeyer counts. He has had two failed marriages (his first one actually only lasted a week! The other lasted 20 years and fell apart in the normal way). His next serious girlfriend is Linda Fusco, who Monk and Natalie expose in "Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend" as having shot and killed her business partner.
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned under Literature, this aspect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> is often exaggerated in adaptation:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>, he is a socially inept recovering drug addict with serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyIssues">Daddy Issues</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, he's an outright (self professed!) high-functioning sociopath. He is also portrayed as literally addicted to the intellectual stimulation of his detective work— in the first episode, he engages in a likely-suicidal action just because he <em>needs</em> to know if a deduction is <em>right</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> DI Chandler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whitechapel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a></em> has OCD. Normally it manifests itself in a need to have everything neat and orderly (to the point where he makes sure clean clothes and soap are near at hand), but the stress of the job can have Chandler going into a full-blown breakdown. He's been shown stuck in his office going through a counting compulsion, repeatedly turning the lights on and off in a sequence as his panic increases because he knows he has to stop and leave but he compulsion prevents him from doing so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ironside1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ironside1967">Ironside (1967)</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake">remake</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ironside2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ironside2013">Ironside (2013)</a></em>. In both versions, the title is a reference to the main character's wheelchair and his name, Robert Ironside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frank Pembleton and Tim Bayliss come to mind. Pembleton's single-minded drive for justice leads him to renounce his Catholic faith and leave his wife, at least for a while, and he has a stroke that sidelines him for much of the fifth season. Bayliss has to deal with an unsolved child-murder that haunts him throughout the series, the trauma of being sexually molested by his uncle, and a gunshot wound that changes his entire outlook on life.
</li><li> Nearly every detective on Giardello's shift fits this trope to varying degrees: Munch and his ex-wives, Gee's estrangement from his son, Kellerman being dogged by corruption allegations stemming from his time in Arson, the depression that drove Crosetti to suicide...and on and on.
</li></ul></li><li> DCI Tanner in the series <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecondSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecondSight">Second Sight</a></em>: being ambitious, he attempts to conceal the fact that he's losing his vision from everyone but his detective partner.
</li><li> Subverted to some extent with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em>, who is often seen as weird and out-of-touch by his sidekick, but usually deals with life a lot better than they do.
</li><li> Brian 'Memory' Lane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks">New Tricks</a></em>.
</li><li> Many of the police characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> are flawed to some degree:
<ul><li> Bunk Moreland is a pretty competent by-the-book detective, but does have problems staying faithful to his wife.
</li><li> Cedric Daniels is fairly competent, but has a past corruption allegation from his time in the Eastern District hanging over him.
</li><li> Jimmy McNulty is shown to be a supremely talented detective, but is also a foul-mouthed, alcoholic, arrogant, self-loathing womanizer who has a tendency <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">to give a fuck when it ain't his turn to give a fuck</a>. It's repeatedly shown that he has little-to-no life outside of detective work, and only shines as a person when he briefly demotes himself down to a beat cop.
</li></ul></li><li> Several in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>: Lennie Briscoe had two failed marriages, a battle with alcoholism, and his daughter got involved with drugs and was later murdered by a drug dealer.
</li><li> Robert Goren in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> has, over the years, had his quirks played up so much that, as of the current season, he recognizes that he's considered a nutjob by others in the department. Even <em>he</em> questions his sanity. And while Mike Logan isn't a brilliant detective, he's had to deal with a reputation as an out-of-control incident waiting to happen. Lampshaded twice: when he interrogates a fence while threatening him with a broken pool cue, and later when he gets a temporary partner who's even more of a hothead than he is. He even looks forward to being the diplomatic one for a change.
</li><li> Speaking of Mike Logan, shall we mention his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">violently abusive mother</a>? And how it's heavily implied a local parish priest sexually molested him as a child? All of which contributed a teeny bit to that little bit of a temper problem he has?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>: Elliot Stabler's anger issues. Olivia Benson's Child-Of-Rape Guilt issues. Munch's crazy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>. With her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">lack of social skills</a>, Temperance Brennan may have a mild case of Asperger's syndrome. According to the show's creator Hart Hanson, Zack Addy "almost definitely has Asperger's syndrome." Brennan is also traumatized from her childhood with her parent's disappearance.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FoylesWar">Foyle's War</a></em> - even taking into account the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> setting, DCS Foyle is usually one of the most well-adjusted people around at the time. His assistant, Sergeant Milner, is closer to the trope, as he has to deal with having had his leg shot off in the Battle of Norway, but even he's got his head screwed on tighter than some of the others making this list.
</li><li> Shawn Spencer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> gets in his own way more often than not because he comes across so buffoonish that almost no one takes him seriously. He's a lot more well-adjusted and relaxed about things than most of the other detectives here though.
<ul><li> Shawn is, in fact, a brilliant detective pretending to be a crazy psychic because he believes the police won't believe the truth. Plus it allows him to act all goofy and solve crime without being a police officer.
<ul><li> He committed a prank that went bad and was convicted of car theft making it impossible for him to become a police officer if he wanted to. He enjoyed watching crimestoppers tapes and picking up clues that were very difficult to guess and sending them in on the police tipline. He did this so often, he was considered a suspect and had to claim to be a psychic to explain his knowledge to avoid prison time.
</li></ul></li><li> Shawn's major "defect" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">refusing to grow up</a>. He is rebelling against his father, a former police officer who tried to get Shawn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps">join the force too</a> and made Shawn pretty miserable as a child (though from what has been shown his father was just strict and meddling, not a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Abusive Parent</a>). Shawn can't let his dad "win," and so avoids adult responsibility as much as possible, and only used his gifts for observation by making crimestoppers' calls until the psychic detective schtick gave him the chance to use his skills <em>and</em> be an embarrassment to his father at the same time. (The show is in some sense a delayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Coming-of-Age Story</a>.)
</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a>/opposite number <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky">Head Detective Carlton Lassiter</a> is socially stunted, coming down off of a difficult divorce, and extremely, unhealthily paranoid. He was also neglected as a child.
</li></ul></li><li> Tony Hill of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WireInTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WireInTheBlood">Wire in the Blood</a></em> is very socially awkward and eccentric, prone to getting lost in his own tangents and neglecting practical matters. The fact that he's better at relating to the serial killers he profiles than to normal people has surely been lampshaded more than once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Raines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Raines">Raines</a></em>: Detective Michael Raines would be haunted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> until he solved their murder... except in his case, the people only he can see and talk to aren't ghosts; they're hallucinations.
</li><li> Find me a recurring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> character who <em>isn't</em> dealing with PTSD flashbacks, traumatic childhood experiences, a family history of mental illness, a slight substance problem, intermittent explosive episodes, or chronic relationship trouble, and then be prepared to be proven wrong half a season later.
<ul><li> Ever since JJ became a full-time profiler in season seven, she now fits the Defective Detective description (she was previously the media liasion). She had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">PTSD after Reid's kidnapping, she shot the guy that shot Garcia, her older sister committed suicide when she was eleven</span>, and the fact that almost every time the team has a case involving young blond women or small town women her demeanor changes. She either gets angry faster ("North Mammon") or just has that look on her face ("Birthright"). It's not as bad as any of the others' (Hotch, Reid, and Emily have the hardest time hiding it. Emily is blatantly obvious if you go back and watch "A Higher Power".), but it's still there.
</li></ul></li><li> Actively subverted with DCI Tom Barnaby of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MidsomerMurders">Midsomer Murders</a></em>, an easy-going, well-adjusted family man who is by far the most stable and sane character presented in the series, given that he lives in the deadliest rural county in England.
</li><li> Special Agent Alex Mahone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em>, fully as smart as escape mastermind Scofield ... also a drug addict constantly teetering on the verge of a mental breakdown.
<ul><li> Plus he has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the body of a criminal he had previously hunted buried in his backyard. Something that gives him troubling flashbacks and allows The Company to blackmail him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longstreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longstreet">Longstreet</a> was a shortlived TV series about an insurance investigator who was blind.
</li><li> Charlie Eppes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs">NUMB3RS</a></em> - a mathematical genius who uses his talents to help his FBI agent brother solve crimes, he has emotional difficulties to the point that he locks himself in the garage to work on unsolvable problems when he can't deal with life.
<ul><li> Charlie is a university teacher who perceives criminal cases as interesting mathematical problems. So he is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius">Ditzy Genius</a> than Defective Detective.
</li><li> In any case the garage thing seems to me to be little more then a mild eccentricity.
</li></ul></li><li> Fitz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cracker">Cracker</a></em>, an overweight alcoholic adulterer with a gambling addiction. For extra irony, he's a hypercompetent criminal psychologist who is capable of deducing anybody's issues in a heartbeat... including his own. He's just powerless to do anything about it. He does try, when it becomes obvious that his marriage and his relationship with his children is at stake. However, he finds he likes the way he is too much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlindJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlindJustice">Blind Justice</a></em>. Jim Dunbar is a blind NYPD detective who was allowed to carry a gun.
</li><li> The American version of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchingEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchingEvil">Touching Evil</a></em> starred a police officer who'd lost most of his impulse control after a gunshot-induced brain injury.
</li><li> Ned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em> has the ability to raise the dead, making him the best murder investigator on the planet, and while not as obviously dysfunctional as someone like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a>, has layer upon layer of personal trauma that manifests as issues with intimacy, a paucity of real passions aside from his love of baking and his rewarding but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHaveSexEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHaveSexEver">frustrating</a> relationship with his girlfriend, hyper-cautiousness and a general malaise. No wonder Ned has intimacy issues: if he even <strong>touches</strong> Chuck, she'll die, because he's already brought her back from the dead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, let me count the ways:
<ul><li> Grissom is socially awkward and gets in trouble because he doesn't play the politics game. Early in the series, he had a near-brush with hereditary hearing loss that would've ended his career.
</li><li> Sara's laundry list of issues only start with having witnessed her mother kill her abusive father when she was young and worring from then on whether murder is a genetic trait.
</li><li> Catherine divorced her husband and work keeps her from spending enough time with her daughter, and oh, her father may be connected to the mob but no one can prove he's done anything. Then he got shot and died in her arms.
</li><li> Warrick started the series with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGamblingAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGamblingAddict">gambling addiction</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb">rookie dies on his watch</a> because he left the scene to place a bet, near the end of his tenure on the show he starts abusing prescription drugs.
</li><li> Brass has an estranged daughter and left his old job in New Jersey because he couldn't be bought.
</li><li> Nick was abused by his babysitter when he was nine and has an issue with closed spaces after the "Grave Danger" episodes.
</li><li> Greg was traumatized after the explosion in the lab and later the entire "Fannysmacking" story-line.
</li><li> Julie Finn got fired back in Seattle for breaking the rules during a case. Of course, DB was that boss and she's working or him again...
</li><li> Morgan Brody dealt for years with her father, Conrad Ecklie, not doing anything to stop her mom from taking her and leaving when she was 14. Though they've gotten closer after she moved to Vegas and he got shot.
</li><li> The only one who mostly averts it is DB, at least in his background. During the series,though, he had his granddaughter kidnapped and his son suspected of murder for a time. Plus having to deal with the same son getting mixed up with the actual killer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em>: Horatio Caine's mother and wife were murdered. Abused by his father.

<ul><li> Mac Taylor lost his wife to 9/11. Framed for murder by a killer who committed suicide in custody. Blown up several times. Taken hostage twice and nearly drowned the second time. Had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> for a while. Got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearJohnLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearJohnLetter">"Dear John" Letter</a> via airmail from a girlfriend who stayed in London after convincing him to go there with her. Shot and left for dead but survived, although it caused a bout with speech aphasia which his trying to hide almost cost him his girlfriend. Of course, that was before he had to rescue her from kidnappers.
</li><li> Lindsay Messer was the sole survivor of a massacre that killed her friends when she was a teenager. Had to shoot a deranged killer to protect herself, Danny and their infant daughter.
</li><li> Stella: Orphan and foster child. Nearly killed by abusive boyfriend.
</li><li> Jo Danville: Kicked out of the FBI by a vengeful senator after she turned in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a>. Then the rapist in the case came back and nearly killed her.
</li><li> Danny Messer: Shot in the back and left temporarily paralyzed. His brother was beaten by a vengeful mob guy and may or may not be dead or severely damaged. Had his and Lindsay's home invaded by a deranged serial killer who held his daughter hostage and who Lindsay had to shoot to stop.
</li><li> Sheldon Hawkes: Framed for murder by the same guy who targeted Danny and Lindsay, caught in a prison riot by the same killer. Swindled out of his life savings. Got in trouble due to a random drug test right after he'd been exposed to marijuana second-hand. He and his girlfriend narrowly escaped being injured in an explosion while on a date...that he'd called in sick for.
</li><li> Adam: Possible OCD issues, definite insecurity issues. Most likely from having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive father</a> who now has Alzheimer's and therefore doesn't remember his actions, so Adam gets no closure when he finally confronts him.

Violence prone, estranged from his son, and occasionally everyone else. Story arc in which he undergoes anger management therapy has somewhat predictable results.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnusuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnusuals">The Unusuals</a></em> (as its name implies) features a whole bunch of quirky detectives, but the two who deserve special mention are Banks and Delahoy, who are partners:
<ul><li> Banks, whose father, grandfather, and uncle all died at the age of 42, has himself just turned 42. He wears a bulletproof vest everywhere he goes (including to bed) and has basically idiot-proofed his entire apartment. He sometimes has panic attacks when he thinks he's going into a dangerous situation.
</li><li> Delahoy, who has been diagnosed with a potentially-fatal brain tumor, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> who suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations. Sometimes, he receives messages from fortune cookies that help him crack his latest case.

Lynley is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">workaholic</a> with a personal life worthy of a soap opera. Havers is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> who has raised antisociality and self-protection via jerkassery to an art form. Somehow, they become incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">close</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest">friends</a> anyway, which spawns an absolutely glorious amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> either has shades of this trope, or <em>pretends</em> he does, so well that the audience never sees him slip. Certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExasperatedPerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExasperatedPerp">the suspects believe he's one</a>.
</li><li> Michael Jericho of "Jericho of Scotland Yard" embodies this trope: His father was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> who was shot in front of him, and Jericho spends his entire career simultaneously trying to show his dead father up and make his dead father proud of him. He has no life outside his work, the only girl he ever loved married someone else while he and his partner Clive Harvey were off fighting in WWII, and his call-girl sometime-girlfriend winds up being basically kidnapped by the man who brought down Jericho's father. This leads him to be driven, harsh, and in so much pain it's difficult to watch at times.
</li><li> Gregory House from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> is a narcissist, drug addict, and in great pain. Treating run-of-the-mill illness is beneath him. His only escape is diagnosing tough cases that have stumped other doctors, much in the same way that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective">Great</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Detective</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">solves cases that have stumped the police</a>.
</li><li> Detective Kate Beckett on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> plays with the trope; she's clearly got issues surrounding the murder of her mother, but has apparently managed to more or less put it behind her at the beginning of the series... until Castle unwittingly digs it all up again, leading to her eventually falling back 'down the rabbit hole' into her obsession with solving it over the course of the series. Season 4 further piles on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by giving her psychological trauma following being shot in the chest in the Season 3 finale, leading to a complete PTSD breakdown in one episode.</span> This aside this, even in the early episodes it's pretty clear that her mother's murder has left her more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">cynical</a> workaholic with little capacity to enjoy life outside of her job until Castle shows up.
</li><li> Will Graham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em> is odd and unsocial and is hinted to have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>. To top it off, he has the gift of "pure empathy" which allows him to get into the minds of the criminals he hunts and causes him to experience nightmares and crippling anxiety. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not to mention the encephalitis (which causes hallucinations, disassociative episodes, and severe headaches) and his psychiatrist not only kept this from him but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">Hannibal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">Lecter</a>.</span>

<ul><li> Benton Fraser: Lost his mother to a killer at age 6. Lost his father to another killer as an adult. His father (now a ghost) takes an intrusive interesting in spending time with him post-mortem. Framed for murder by vengeful ex girlfriend (who he had previously put in prison after they fell in love with each other).
</li><li> Ray K: Caught in a bank robbery that scared him so badly he wet his pants in front of his future (now ex) wife. Had his whole life uprooted so he could pretend to be Ray V while the latter went undercover, leaving him to deal with the fallout from Ray V's previous actions without knowing anything about them.
</li><li> But he must have had Ray V's files, which he could read to find out about him and his cases. Ray V may not have put everything in the file, however. I don't think he's as defective as Fraser or Ray V. The fandom just likes to make him into a victim.
</li><li> Ray V: Abusive, alcoholic dad whom he continued to have issues with even after the guy died.(another case of arguing with the ghost). Had his whole life uprooted to go undercover with The Mafia, only to have it happen again and have to deal with having been replaced by Ray K in the meantime when he returns to the force.

Threatening to blow your own brains out to prove how serious you are about something is common.

D84 is more helpful, but is clearly an eccentric by the standards of robots - somehow, it is able to go against its own programming in pursuit of its work, which leaves it less than stable, and its story ends with it blowing out its own brains in order to save the Doctor.
</li><li> Both of the main characters for season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueDetective">True Detective</a></em> embody this trope: outwardly, Rust Cohle is extremely quiet and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> or even depressed. Get him to talk and he shows himself to be an incredibly cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">nihilist</a> who claims human consciousness is a mistake of nature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">mostly as a result of his deceased daughter.</a> Cohle also suffers the effects of multiple substance abuse, both current and former, mostly due to an overlong period as a DEA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">undercover agent</a>.

</li><li> Averted at first with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em> concerning Nick Burkhardt. While he's dealing with his newfound status as a Grimm and the death of the only family he knows, he still generally avoids being a troubled or broken individual, and fairs quite well both as a person and as a detective...in the first season. Then his girlfriend loses her memories of him and his mom comes back, then he gets turned into an uncontrollable rage zombie who kills someone and leaves him with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a> issues, then he gets raped and loses his powers, and all the while he slowly-but-surely becomes more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>. After all that, he crosses into this trope.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Innocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Innocent">Innocent</a></em>: Protagonist Yusuf exhibits elements of the trope at the start of the series, having a preteen daughter he rarely sees, a tumultuous relationship with his ex-wife, and a tendency to harass said ex-wife's new paramour. By the final episode, things are looking a little better for him.
</li><li> Played mostly for comedy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TenspeedAndBrownShoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TenspeedAndBrownShoe">Tenspeed And Brown Shoe</a></em>, and zig-zagged for one of the two leads.
<ul><li> Lionel Whitney zig-zags the trope in that his biggest problem is that he decided to become a detective (after spending most of his working life as a stockbroker) as a way of living out his pulp fiction-inspired dreams of being a hard-boiled gumshoe, and as a result tends to see the cases his agency takes on in melodramatic genre terms. At the same time he's not <em>quite</em> equipped to handle the grayed morality and action that requires in practice, being something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>.

Her parents died in a car crash when she was young, and she doubts she can live up to the family's reputation as detectives - particularly because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">gender issues</a> - so she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">perfectionist with serious self-doubt issues</a>. There's also the protagonist's uncle Dojima, who's inability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneCase">give up the chase for his wife's killer</a> causes a major strain on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad">relationship with his daughter</a>, and his partner Adachi, who is the department's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> and a major screw-up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taken even further with Adachi when he turns out to be the <em>villain</em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> misanthrope who killed two women for (in his mind) being whores, used his goofy veneer to trick another man into almost murdering several people, and was willing to let the world end basically because he thought he deserved a better lot in life.</span>
</li><li> Unsurprisingly, given that he's hailed as the Second Detective Prince, Goro Akechi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has shades of this as well. He's much more charismatic than Naoto, but is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> obsessed with making himself popular due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal">his childhood</a>: born out of wedlock - something that's majorly looked down upon in Japan - he was passed around a series of abusive foster homes after his mother committed suicide out of shame (at one point he thinks to himself that his fans would surely turn on him if they knew he was an 'unwanted child', showing he has trust issues as well). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Like Adachi, he's eventually revealed to be an antagonist, albeit a more tragic one - his father is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and used Akechi's desire for status and revenge to turn him into a hitman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">in middle school</a>. Akechi's title is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroism">almost entirely a farce</a>, built on solving mental breakdowns he caused himself, and his father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">knew all along</a> that he was planning to stab him in the back.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Norman Jayden</a> is an FBI agent with a serious drug problem (which it's implied he only developed in the first place because the drugs in question were to meant to counteract the effects of the virtual reality system he makes use of on the job). Scott Shelby, who's a more conventional <em>noir</em> detective, doesn't have any obvious issues, but he does lead a pretty solitary and occasionally violent life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Oh, and he's also the serial killer Jayden and everyone else are trying to catch.</span>
</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em> is a detective who has developed a severe case of retrograde amnesia after an incredibly wild drinking binge. And that's not to mention the fact that the various in-game skills take the form of voices in his head giving him guidance of varying usefulness. The player, however, has the option to do their damnest to eschew this, by choosing to play as The Boring Cop archetype, which means trying to be as a straight-laced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">Consummate Professional</a> as possible and ignoring the wackier dialogue choices and actions. The description for its associated thought, <em>Regular Law Official</em>, notes that this can't come naturally for someone with your colourful past and current looks.
<ul><li> If you manage to unravel your past <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out you were always this way. While you have 18 years of honorable service, during which you solved 216 cases while only killing three people in the line of duty (a number commented on as extremely low, given that most of your time on the force was spent working in the most violent and crime-ridden precinct in the city), and turned down promotion to captain twice because it would mean leaving the streets, you were also a barely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict">Functional Addict</a> who worked in bouts of productivity between binges and displayed several signs of deteriorating mental health exacerbated by your divorce, and only managed to stay on the force because you were a genius when you were sober. When you start hearing rumors that you are a Dirty Cop who moonlights as a hitman for the crime boss known as La Puta Madre, Katsuragi brushes those rumors aside, saying you were never stable enough to pull off something like that.</span>

All this culminates in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">an unfriendly disposition</a>, a lot of trust-issues and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoicism</a> that prevents her from relating to anyone, save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">the main character</a> after a long while.
