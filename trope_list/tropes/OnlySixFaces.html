In contrast, homogenous outfits (like school uniforms) tend to encourage faces to be drawn differently. Because of this, a character's outfit actually <em>changing</em> usually means its supposed to mark an emotional change in either them or how we're supposed to see them. A simple haircut can also mess up with who the character is very easily.

This results in various instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> characters, where skin tone is the only clue for guessing the characters' ethnicity.

As the page quote implies and the length of this section proves, this is a common situation in anime, especially for female characters. However, each show/verse tends to have its own distinct face-style, with more dramatic differences between certain studios and character designers. It's hard to market a new series if the characters look too generic, but having dramatic differences in simplistic face designs within the same show can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">distracting</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> and its sequels/spinoffs have about four basic body and face types - and character designer Hisashi Hirai's every work after Gundam Seed (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge">Heroic Age</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor">Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor</a></em>) features the exact same character designs, arguably due to <em>Gundam Seed's</em> great success. (Which is a shame because he was quite versatile in his earlier works.) It gets a little absurd when you notice that the only difference between Kazuki from <em>Fafner</em> and Shinn from <em>SEED Destiny</em> is eye color. This let him earn his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Pun</a> in Chinese that translates to "bottleneck" (which is pronounced the same way as "Hirai" in Chinese), indicating he cannot get through his design bottleneck and kept using the same face over and over. The 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster">Remaster</a> of <em>Gundam SEED</em> is another perfect example. While <em>SEED</em> was the start of his generic art style, at least the early episodes had the characters with more distinctive features and unique quirks. The remaster completely throws these out in favor of making everyone look as identical as they did in <em>SEED Destiny</em>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GundamAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GundamAbridged">G Gundam Abridged</a></em> where Domon points out that his brother Kyoji looks a lot like American Chibodee Crockett, for which he blames the animators.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu">Ken Akamatsu</a>'s extensive cast of females usually end up like this:
<ul><li> In the most extreme example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Master of Disguise</a> Kanako seems almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, easily dressing up as any of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> characters and passing off the big-breasted Mutsumi as Keitaro with little more than some makeup and hair styling, glasses, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sarashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sarashi">sarashi</a>.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Negima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Negima">Negima!</a></em> animated series also received flak for changing the hairstyles of the girls to more bold/garish colors. Interestingly, its creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">admitted not all of his own color choices were static at that point</a> and in fact began using some introduced colors as official ones because they were cute or make them more distinguishable in merchandise and group shots.
</li><li> The spinoff manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NegimaSecondSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NegimaSecondSeason">Negima Neo</a></em> is really bad about this; pick two random characters who are doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeStare">Moe Stare</a> and their faces will probably look exactly the same.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGhostGirl">Sayo</a>'s profile, he apologized for making her a white-haired Konoka.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PaniPoniDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PaniPoniDash">Pani Poni Dash!</a></em> parodies this by just having two generic characters (one male and one female) that look out of place compared to the main characters taking up often dozens of seats in a classroom in one shot. Sometimes these characters are randomly replaced with other objects, including, but not limited to animals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> is a pretty standard example of both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>. Subverted later on in the manga and especially with the 2012 anime, which turns the series into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Attractive characters tend to have the exact same facial features, sans eyes and hair, while characters who look older or are uglier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">tend to be very diverse in their designs.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> also homogenized once very different characters as if a single face-shape template is now used. When Uryuu was mistaken for Ichigo, a close up of his face was accompanied by his response, "You got a good look at his face, didn't you? So what part of me resembles Kurosaki?" Cue Memetic mutations and a fandom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a> is having fun with this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kubo's been able to hide plot points in plain sight until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> due to fans not knowing if he's using this trope or dropping clues, e.g., Zangetsu's resemblance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder">Zombie Powder</a></em>: Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a>'s female characters tend to have the exact same face, differentiated only by their haircuts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>: Very similar body and facial types combined with everyone wearing the same uniform AND quite a few people sharing hair-color makes actually telling characters apart a real challenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> uses this often, with about five or six major body types copied over and over again due to the large amount of alien and monstrous races; this results in bizarre circumstances when characters like Vegeta and Jeiice meet up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, especially when they wear the same uniform. In contrast, Bulma is one of the series's only reoccurring females since the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, so she's often given a different design. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>'s main strength seems to lie in designing truly monstrous characters and vehicles.)
<ul><li> When Goku went to Namek to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find a new Kami</span>, he said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">there were a lot of Piccolos in the village</a>.
</li><li> Android 18 is distinctive from <em>all</em> other female designs, while even Bulma has some resemblance to the generic female. 18 has a very different nose and eyes, probably because she was one of the only serious female fighters in the series. However, jet black her hair and you have Android 17. The similarity between the 17 and 18, along with them both having rather stand-out designs, could be intentionally invoking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a>.
</li><li> Many of the main character's faces look very similar, with only small changes; Tenshinhan, Yamucha, Vegeta, and the adult versions of Goku, Gohan and Trunks all share several major features (thick eyebrows, pointy nose, large eyes). All of the above characters except Trunks also have the same eye color/design (plain black pupil, color indistinguishable). The only characters from the Cell-era group that really stick out physically are Chaozu (who is barely a speaking part at this point), Piccolo and Krillin.
</li><li> Oddly, the villains seem immune - even bit players like Zarbon are given more distinct looks. And barring genetic resemblances, the main villains do not have look-alikes anywhere else in the series, while the heroes all resemble each other. The unique-villains, generic-heroes pattern is rigid enough that Vegeta, who was eventually destined for the heroes' side, already looked familiar on his first appearance thanks in part to the very similar face of his comrade Raditz, who himself is an exception to the unique-villain rule because he's Son Goku's brother but could've easily been mistaken for Vegeta's brother if they first showed up together; and Piccolo, who looked unique as a villain in <em>Dragon Ball</em>, only had his species, 90% carbon-copies who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">mostly siblings</a>, introduced <em>shortly after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a></em>.

It involved Arale's friend Akane disguising herself as Midori and messing with Senbei, which the author described (through narration) as "A fiendish scheme that takes advantage of my inability to draw more than one female face!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Which is odd since that very chapter proves Arale has a different face</a>...

Though kudos to Oda he managed to avert this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Amazon Lily arc</a> where he had dozens of female characters with different facial features. Still even past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, you too easily label female characters under Nami clone or Robin clone categories.
<ul><li> Originally even the male characters had similar features, e.g Shanks having the same eyes and face shape as Luffy (to the extent that fans widely assumed this was intentional and thought Shanks was Luffy's father) but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> kicked in and Shanks looks distinctly different. Sanji also looked more like Luffy in the early days having a rounder face nowadays Sanji looks more like Zoro or Law being square-jawed.
</li></ul></li><li> Tachikawa Megumi's works seem to have only <em>one</em> face, leaving the reader constantly looking back to the character index. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail">Kaitou Saint Tail</a></em>, where Seira, who has different coloured hair and eyes from Meimi, dresses up as her seamlessly and needs to be pointed out with an arrow and note to the audience.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> deliberately chose to embrace this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> it by calling it the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign">Star System</a>" as though his manga universe were a movie studio using actors; he came up with about forty recognizable character designs (occasionally to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a> in an effort to make them distinctive) and recycled them — even the instantly-recognizable ones like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Atom</a> — in multiple series.
<ul><li> This was continued by the creators of the movie version of Tezuka's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> with the character Rock.
</li><li> He took it up a notch in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em> series. Not only did he use his major star system, but the primary theme of the series was reincarnation and the eternal struggle in attempting to catch the Phoenix. In the case of one soul, he was always doomed to have a large misshapen nose by the end of the story arc. Arguably the entire star system is these same people reincarnating again and again.
</li></ul></li><li> Fujio Akatsuka's mangas tend to avert this by giving characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">very recognizable faces</a>, but it still crops up in some of his works. Pretty girls like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimitsuNoAkkoChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimitsuNoAkkoChan">Akko</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun">Totoko</a> tend to have a standard "doe-eyed" look, and small children tend to have a "bird-mouthed" look similar to Chibita. Justified for the Matsuno brothers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun">Osomatsu-kun</a></em>, however, as they are sextuplets.
<ul><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em>'s first ending theme <em>Six Same Faces</em>, where the boys date a group of same-faced sextuplet girls and talk about how both sets seemed to encounter the same person 6 times.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto">Leiji Matsumoto</a> tends to use the same faces over and over again. Sometimes it's explained (Mamoru Kodai was supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a>, for example), and sometimes it's not.
</li><li> Earlier art for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> novels have fairly distinguishable characters; as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> set in, though, each character, moreso the females, become more and more identical facially and body-wise (both the anime and the books avoid using the same exact body types for the major female characters), leaving only their hair (and eyes, but very sporadically compared to before) as a distinguishing mark. Pick up the first <em>Slayers Special</em> novel, then pick up the latest <em>Slayers Smash</em> (a continuation) and be amazed. Most of the females look like Lina, with Lina's new distinguishing mark being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NippleAndDimed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NippleAndDimed">nipples sticking out everywhere</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> can be weird about this. While all of the Claymores have fairly distinct facial features (impressive, given their identical coloration and uniformly unblemished skin), the unimportant human characters share maybe four or five faces between them, while important humans have distinctive faces.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shinichi and Kaitou Kid are deliberately drawn alike, and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">not-girlfriends</a>, Ran and Aoko, who could be identical twins as well. Indeed in some non-canon movies this allows Kid to pass himself off as Shinichi whenever needed, without requiring a special disguise.
</li><li> Where the series really runs headlong into this trope is in the many, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">random people</a> around the cast who drop dead of various murder schemes, and their friends and family who may or may not have done it. As of this edit there are more than 820 episodes in the anime and over 960 chapters in the manga... and the typical one or two episode case introduces a minimum of 4 to 6 one-shot characters. That is a <em>lot</em> of people to make up, so it's no wonder they all start to look the same.
</li><li> Even Conan has a "twin"—Kataoka Jun from <em>The Kidnapper's Disappearing Getaway Car</em>. More noticeable when he wears an <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outfit that is the same as Conan's except with yellow bow when he finally accepts Sachiko as his second mother</span>.
</li><li> In fact, it's even a plot point in several cases, particularly one of the latest, where Ms. Kobayashi gets mistaken for Satou several times in the police station <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and worries Shiratori is only dating her for the semblance between the two. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlAfterAll">He isn't.</a>)</span>
</li><li> Also a plot point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIVsDetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIVsDetectiveConan">Lupin III vs. Detective Conan</a></em> TV special, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ran is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeKing">Fake King</a> lookalike of a European princess</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em> does this with Kurono and Inaba; both are similar enough in the black-and-white manga that it would be hard to tell the two apart...That is, if Kurono wasn't a great "everyone comes home alive, leave no man behind" hero type, and Inaba wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">cowardly wuss</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> gets accused of this a lot with the rounded style of her characters' faces. This is especially noticeable in anthologies of her early work, where the heroes of different stories tend to look almost identical.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>. It's funny when everyone says how much Kagome looks just like Kikyo when both look equally similar to Sango, and almost every other woman. In fact, the difference between Kagome's and Kikyo's hairstyles and skintones makes them look <em>less</em> like each other than any other two characters of the same age and sex you could compare. And while their resemblance is a plot point (due to reincarnation), there is no excuse for why every <em>other</em> young woman looks the same.
<ul><li> There was one episode involving a young priest and his three sisters, all of whom (well, the sisters) looked just like each other and Sango.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a> is essentially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>'s Ranma Saotome with a wig, contacts, and fangs (and they look even more identical during the one day a month that Inuyasha becomes an ordinary human), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rinne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rinne">Rinne Rokudo</a> is Ranma in a track suit and red hair.
<ul><li> And Kagome is Akane, when she had long hair. And Yura of the Hair was Nabiki. And Myoga is absolutely indistinguishable from Happosai.
</li><li> Ranma and Inuyasha even have the same voice actor. In Japanese <em>and</em> English.
</li></ul></li><li> Little kids (or characters who look like them) tend to suffer from this in her work too: Jariten (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>), Shippo (<em>Inuyasha</em>), and Rokumon (<em>RIN-NE</em>) might as well be triplets.
</li><li> Age and sex are what make her characters distinct. All children are Shippo, all young men are Miroku, all young women are Sango.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">constant hiding</a> of Onigumo's face becomes hilarious when you consider that, as a young man before his injury, anybody who's watched that far knows what he must look like.
</li><li> Scott McCloud (<em>Making Comics</em>, p. 123) gives a slightly different perspective on this by pointing out that Takahashi is one of a number of artists who "have a narrower range of features for heroic or beautiful protagonists, but a wide range of face and body types among supporting characters."
</li><li> Random villagers tend to have more elongated faces than her main characters, though. You can tell who's going to be important to the episode by the presence or absence of the basic faces - if he looks like Miroku, you're either going to have to save him or kill him.
</li><li> Rumiko Takahashi's use of Only Six Faces is most present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>. As most of the characters are teenaged martial artists, they tend to be built the same and differences in body type (such as Akane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">A-Cup Angst</a>) tend to be implied through words rather than the illustrations themselves. With Mousse, Ryōga, and Ranma, if you cut all of their hair and got rid of Ryōga's bandana, they'd be virtually indistinguishable (aside from Ryōga's fangs and pale eyes). Same goes for Shampoo, Akane, Ukyō, Girl-Ranma, and the most of the other female characters. The adults mostly seem to be more distinct, though: Sōun and Genma don't have any almost-twins running around, for example.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mushishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mushishi">Mushishi</a></em>: Realistic hair and clothing, combined with simplified faces, means great difficulty telling most of the characters apart.
</li><li> From manga to manga, Mishima Kazuhiko's characters tend to look the same.
</li><li> The characters, especially the lead females, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitsuruAdachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitsuruAdachi">Mitsuru Adachi</a>'s dozen or so manga series look very, very similar. In the art books, the only way to tell when one series stops and another begins is by the chapter headings. Each character within a series looks different, but each series has character designs similar to the previous one. With the exception of <em>Nine</em> and <em>Cross Game</em>, there's are only two heroine types in terms of appearances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> in any adaption, especially the girls. They look almost the same with different hairstyle and color, which can be even more annoying when two girls use pigtails. Men don't get away with it either; Schneider is just Tsubasa with blonde hair and green or blue eyes.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>. Hanajima and her younger brother Megumi are drawn with the same face, and everyone thinks they look alike...but Hana always protests that they look completely different.
</li><li> Manga artist Sho-U Tajima tends to recycle a small handful of not just faces, but complete character designs over and over again for all of his different projects, resulting in characters that reside in completely different games and comics that wind up looking identical to one another in every way. For example, Rion Steiner of the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galerians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galerians">Galerians</a></em> seems to be a clone of Hisashi Shimazu, a villain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MPDPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MPDPsycho">MPD Psycho</a></em>, right down to the single hoop earring.
</li><li> Taka Tony is well known for being able to draw exactly one sort of face. It is off-set somewhat by the sheer detail put into the rest of his drawings but becomes disturbing when he has more than one character is a picture. He manages to play it straight <em>and</em> subvert it with his work with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em> series: Female characters are almost the same girl wearing different dresses, but male characters (especially non-human ones) are very diverse, apart from maybe the lead males.
</li><li> All of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WataruYoshizumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WataruYoshizumi">Wataru Yoshizumi</a>'s series suffer from this. One can find about 100 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy">Marmalade Boy</a></em>'s Yuu look-alikes across her various works.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre">Yaoi</a> mangaka Minami Haruka is well-known for having many of her characters look rather similar, compounded by the fact that she also tends to stick to one body type.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a>:</em>
<ul><li> While it has tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a> and often relies on characteristics like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a>, many characters have distinctive eye shapes, face shapes, and expressions. The first four seasons of the anime adaptation, however, play it very straight, and doesn't help by giving <em>everybody</em> except for Cuba the exact same skin color.
</li><li> There are a few instances of this in the manga. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> notes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Sweden's</a> face is very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Germany</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Prussia's</a> faces, albeit with the idea of a "stern expression" more prominent; he explains this by saying that Sweden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">has family ties</a> to Germany's ancestor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Germania</a>. In another instance, he acknowledges that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Kugelmugel</a> looks pretty much exactly like a shorter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">Iceland</a> with braided twintails.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroMashima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroMashima">Hiro Mashima</a> has often been decried of doing this both within and across his series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, especially in regards to his female characters, which can only be distinguishable by eye shape. Granted, the male characters who aren't elderly or outright inhuman tend to suffer from this as well; it's just that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">the inhuman female characters are always cute</a>. It's gotten to the point where people are crying foul over his follow-up work, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero">EDENS ZERO</a></em>, for essentially just recoloring the hair of <em>Fairy Tail</em>'s main leads and passing them off as new characters; and that's <em>not</em> taking into consideration the fact that the main characters of <em>Fairy Tail</em> are guilty of this themselves, evident when one examines his other works such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonsterSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonsterSoul">Monster Soul</a></em>.
</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em> is notable for its more realistic style and lack of the usual visual gags, the female characters (except for Doa) have the same face. If Rin didn't have those hair rings, she would be practically indistinguishable from the other female characters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuWatase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuWatase">Yuu Watase</a> is particularly bad about this - they appear to have two teenager/young adult faces, male and female, with different hairstyles and the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a> thrown in for good measure (and other age groups aren't exactly bursting with variety). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Imadoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Imadoki">Imadoki!</a></em>, Watase actually had to <em>change a character's hair color</em> in order to make him distinguishable from another after he shaved his goatee. This is made even worse because of the two short stories shoehorned into the last volume of <em>Imadoki!</em>, both starring male and female protagonists who are 100% identical to the ones from the story that just finished... and equally indistinguishable from the lead couples of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinshunkiMimanOkotowari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinshunkiMimanOkotowari">Shinshunki Miman Okotowari</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AbsoluteBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AbsoluteBoyfriend">Absolute Boyfriend</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Alice19th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Alice19th">Alice19th</a></em>.
</li><li> With some occasional exceptions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> seems to be populated with face-clones.
</li><li> The female students in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> are the same design except for hair and eye style or props, making it difficult for the uninitiated to tell them apart.
<ul><li> Exception: The foreign exchange student, Kimura, is very easy to tell apart from the other girls, being the only blonde/blue-eyed girl in the show. She also wears a different uniform.
</li><li> Maria also averts the trope to some degree, although it may be due to her different skin tone rather than her actual facial features. Then we have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a> Kotokon...
</li><li> Naturally, Kiri is the easiest one to tell apart, since the times when she's not wrapped up in her blanket is when she's being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>.
</li><li> This gets even more apparent with the end-of-episode guest artwork from other six-face mangakas, like Rumiko Takahashi.
</li></ul></li><li> Ignoring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> nature of most of the side characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>—imported from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>— <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> really only has about six faces for all her series: The deep male, the innocent male, the mature female, the innocent female, the cheery female, and the nondescript either. And even the mature vs. innocent looks are often blurred during mature moments, and vice-versa. A good example is <a class="urllink" href="https://sailormusic.net/wordpress/images/artbook1/sailormoon-artbook-1-27-28.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> - everyone's wearing similar facial expressions and a face swap should lead to near identical results. Male characters do look very similar, this is more blatant with Ao no Sapphire, who not only has the standard young male face, but his hair is almost the same in style and color as Mamoru's, just a with a very slight wave and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack">stylized more bluish</a>. In some parts of the manga, where the hair of both guys in black (the manga is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">black and white</a>) is very hard to distinguish them if it wasn't by Sapphire's black moon mark in the forehead. It's also why Haruka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a> look is so convincing, as she's given the "young man" facial structure.
</li><li> Lampshaded in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, a manga known for its abundant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingtheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingtheFourthWall">fourth wall breaking</a>, a couple of times:
<ul><li> In an omake, where Ginpachi-sensei explains how to draw the characters.
<div class="indent"> "Next I'll teach you how to draw Shinpachi and Kagura. Draw a normal guy; make him as bland as possible. Then give him glasses. You're done! Next, how to draw Kagura. Take off Shinpachi's glasses and change the hair to white. Then give her dumplings. You're done!"
</div></li><li> In the host club arc, while arguing like little kids as usual, the characters make some self-aware remarks, noting that pairs like Gintoki-Hijikata and Shinpachi-Sougo look exactly the same, only differing in hair colors.
</li><li> In the amnesiac shogun arc, as his comrades frustratingly hint him at who the heck he is with and how the heck he's not recognizing he's with the shogun, saying something like "That guy kinda looks like someone important, don't ya think?" as the shogun's face is shown on the TV, Katsura, in his typical absolutely oblivious and stupid fashion, replies, "So you guys all see it too. If you put this topknot wig, every character in this manga looks the same." which is true.
</li></ul></li><li> Masami Kurumada of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> fame is <em>very</em> famous for this. He has two faces for men (normal men and bulky men), one face for little boys and one face for girls. That's all. The fact that many of his characters share similar hairstyles doen't really help — it was for that reason that the anime adaptation gave them tons of different hair colors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>, more than a handful of the women look <em>remarkably</em> similar, which is used as a plot point. Also, before his character development kicked in, Rei looked a lot like Shin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakakoShimura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakakoShimura">Takako Shimura</a>, mangaka of works such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em>, even admits that she always draws works where the characters don't look very different (which means many characters from different series look like characters from other series). When the only apparent differences between girls and boys are hairstyle and clothes, it's not exactly surprising that Nitori can easily pass for a girl just by putting on a hairband. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> comes into place by middle school in <em>Wandering Son</em> and fixes the issue but some characters, like Kanako and Nitori, still look pretty similar.
</li><li> Lampshaded in an omake for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZettaiKarenChildren">Zettai Karen Children</a></em>, when a male character asks to keep his signature headband because there's already two other guys with the same hair/face style and he's worried about not being recognized.
</li><li> The female characters in Yamatogawa's stories are all quite distinct. The main male character is the same guy across all stories.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasamuneShirow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasamuneShirow">Masamune Shirow</a> is a major offender here. His male characters are ok and plentiful, but he seems to only have one female face he can draw (and he did comment on this in his artbooks quite a few times).
<ul><li> In his case, though, it should be noted that this is most egregious with his female <em>leads</em> (of which he has quite a few, and they have <em>very similar professions</em>). Secondary female cast members tend to be quite varied in age and appearance (particularly across nationalities, as is the case in <em>Appleseed</em>). His own admission also pertained to his tendency towards women as commissioned officers in police or military forces as the central protagonist, and began making some effort towards that in his later manga (with Leona Ozaki of <em>Dominion: Conflict No. 1</em> looking immediately different than his past heroines).
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsBravo">Girls Bravo</a></em>, specifically the girls, have similar looking faces.
</li><li> Despite Akiko Hatsu's skill in drawing brilliantly detailed settings, antiques and clothes in both Victorian England and Ancient Japan, most of her characters tend to look very similar. Not that they are less beautiful as a result, but it's just somewhat confusing when there is two teen protagonists, both with supernatural powers, both with dark hair, both of similar build, in two completely unrelated comics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren">Psyren</a></em> is usually just a mild case of this with its male characters, but it has a few especially jarring examples with its main character. That was very confusing during the fight at the Grigori research facility when Ageha fights a guy who looks almost identical to him.
</li><li> In the beginning, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> actually averted this, with characters having different faces. But as a side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, if the character is a young adult, it has the same chin and mouth as every other young adult regardless of gender. Several characters also strongly resemble each other; its usually justified though as most are either related in some way, or the resemblance is deliberately symbolic (for instance, Yahiko/ Deva Pain looks almost exactly like an older Naruto; this is probably to reflect his status as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>).
<ul><li> An odd variant of this exists in the movies. While male characters usually have unique designs, many of the main female characters appear to be re-colored versions of characters from the show itself. For instance, Shion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippudenTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippudenTheMovie">Naruto Shippuden: The Movie</a></em> appears to be a platinum blond version of Hinata (complete with pupil-less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEyes">Magical Eyes</a> that are essentially a palette-swapped Byakugan) while Amaru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippudenTheMovieBonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippudenTheMovieBonds">Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds</a></em> resembles a tanned Tayuya. There's also a character named Matsuri who was initially created in an anime filler episode before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">appearing in the manga</a> who looks just like Sakura but with brown hair and eyes.
</li></ul></li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArinaTanemura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArinaTanemura">Arina Tanemura</a>'s main heroines have a similar face, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEyesLittleEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEyesLittleEyes">gigantic-eyed and all</a>, with eye-size variations and her male characters only occasionally bear different-sized eyes and pupils. She is fond of long hair so most heroines also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a>, though she does style it differently from character to character.
</li><li> Kaori Yuki was guilty of this during earlier years (the first six volumes of God Child and the first volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>, possibly earlier work too). There was always a man with slightly longer, dark hair, a blonde/brunette women with long, curly hair, and a line of young boys with blond hair (honestly, could anyone tell Eric, Ariel and that boy from the God child chapter Who killed Cock Robin apart?)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bizenghast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bizenghast">Bizenghast</a></em> is very much a victim of this. Almost all the young women and men, including Vincent and Dinah, have the same face with different hair. (The old men and women were slightly less subjected to it.) They all seem to have the same height as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax">Studio Gainax</a>'s Yoshiyuki Sadamoto even satirized himself with this; pointing out that you could draw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Shinji</a> by drawing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia</a>'s face <a class="urllink" href="http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/16767/">with different hair.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> H-Manga artist Shunjyo Shusuke is a heavily blatant case of only <em>one</em> face <em>and</em> body for either gender (and it's only a matter of effort in eye-shine to make one into the other) <strong>however</strong> this is excusable with the variations in personalities and the fact that both models are detailed enough to stand out compared to more typical anime styles.
</li><li> Yamamoto Yoshifumi, another H-manga artist is a funny case in that he started using <strong>exactly one face</strong> with the only difference between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">genders</a> were the breasts making women look like walking letter "Ps" <em>then</em> changed his style to make everyone shorter, rounder and more Moe-like... and it's still exactly one face!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FromEroicaWithLove">From Eroica with Love</a></em> is an example that oddly supports and subverts this trope. Sparing differences in hair, eyes, and wardrobe, "handsome" characters (<em>i.e.</em> Klaus, Dorian, and Agent Z) look very similar. Comic relief and other supporting characters (<em>i.e.</em> Agents A and B, Mr. James, and Bonham) are distinctive in appearance: these folks vary greatly in terms of build, facial and skull shape, height, etc.
</li><li> Shuichi Shigeno has, perhaps inevitably, slipped into this territory. More than a few longtime readers have pointed out that the Two Guys From Tokyo are essentially an overweight Takumi and Itsuki and, when Mika was introduced, honestly thought for a while that Natsuki had made a comeback.
</li><li> Earlier in his career, Tsukasa Hojo, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>, only had one "beautiful woman" face, and considering the all female main cast of one series and the vast amount of female clientele in the other, it was a face you saw <em>quite</em> a lot of. As <em>City Hunter</em> went on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">this began to change</a>, however, most evident with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Kaori</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">supposedly looks like a cute boy</a>, except at first she looks like every other girl.
</li><li> After the wonderful contrast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Hugh Laurie</a>'s near-bishounen Bertie and crooked-nosed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>'s round-faced Jeeves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster">Jeeves and Wooster</a></em>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://axxc.nl/pgw/boe/inim.htm">the gajillion different artist's interpretations of the two over the years<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, it's a more than a little disappointing to read the manga <em>Please, Jeeves</em> and find that ALL the men have the same face-shape, just with different eyes and hair.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KodomoNoOmocha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KodomoNoOmocha">Kodomo no Omocha</a></em>. Fuka and Sana have practically identical faces. However, as a whole, Kodocha averts this trope.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gfycat.com/ExhaustedGlumAlpinegoat">Aoi Nishimata may have recycled a few faces here and there<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> characters exhibit <a class="urllink" href="http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/jizo2/imgs/5/a/5a05cc1e.jpg">a rather remarkable similarity with each other<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em> this seems to be going on with the girls' faces. Put them all in a row and ignore their hair colors. Surprise!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/MoriNoAndo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/MoriNoAndo">Mori no Ando</a></em> as every character has the exact same face.
</li><li> Manwha by Hwang Ri Mi and Han Yu-rang can be accused of this. Most characters can only be distinguished by clothes and hairstyles, and the "ugly" characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a>.
</li><li> Though the males can come off better, every female character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jormungand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jormungand">Jormungand</a></em> has the exact same, triangle like face.
</li><li> Shojo mangaka Haruka Fukushima is <em>incredibly</em> guilty of this (though got <em>slightly</em> better after time), to the point that most of her heroines <strong>have the exact same hairstyle and hair color</strong>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> tends to fall into this as Araki's art style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">evolves</a> over the years. For example, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Part 3</a>, <em>three</em> of the main characters - Jotaro, Kakyoin, and Polnareff - are virtually only distinguishable due to their different hairstyles and outfits.
<ul><li> Around the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun">Part 7</a> is where it's the worst, but since everyone has such crazy and unique outfits and general appearances, you can still tell them apart, even if all women (and most guys) have the same vacant stare and semi-open mouth.
</li><li> Araki seems to be at least partially aware of this problem based on the stand Paper Moon King from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion">Part 8</a>, which can afflict it's targets with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia">face blindness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is shown from the victim's perspective by drawing every character they see with the same face.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular">No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!</a></em> (at least the anime version) is pretty good at avoiding this, episode 2 and the end of the first volume of the manga had an in-universe example. Tomoko gets excited because a boy in her class drew her fairly pretty, so she thinks he might have a crush on her. Turns out, as he's in the manga club, he draws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">all the background girls with the exact same face.</a> He mentions how that to him, this design is for characters who are "nothing special."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorinagaMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorinagaMilk">Morinaga Milk</a>'s protagonists are often identical to Mari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends">Girl Friends</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a> has been running into this problem around the late Oughts. After the runaway success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>, many characters of their later anime like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka">Hyouka</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamakoMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamakoMarket">Tamako Market</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoundEuphonium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoundEuphonium">Sound! Euphonium</a></em> uses the same basic facial model for the girls <em>and</em> the boys. Their styles are actually different between anime when you compare them, but they're still very similar to the casual eye which has made many people mistake Kyoto Animation for only having one art style.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em>, another Kyoto Animation work, runs into this problem as well. Girls and younger-looking boys such as Nagisa and Nitori (as well as <em>full grown adult</em> Ms. Amakata) tend to follow the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">Puni Plush</a> model. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> boys end up either looking like Haruka or Makoto. Particularly Makoto, as <em>Eternal Summer</em>'s Sousuke looks like a darker-haired Makoto with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes">Tsurime Eyes</a>, while Rei's brother looks <em>exactly</em> like Makoto with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">blue hair.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em> has an in-universe example to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> such trend in Shoujo manga. Many of the male characters in Nozaki's manga <em>Let's Fall in Love!</em> use Suzuki as a character model. This was exacerbated in chapter 77, where Yuzuki is completely unable to tell the guys apart, and wonders why their hairstyle changes every few panels or so.
</li><li> Aside from Shouko, Shoya, and Tomohiro many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em> characters look alike. It's especially common with background characters, to the point where there was a fan controversy about the final chapter revolving around whether a new female character was a previously seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFriendNewGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFriendNewGender">male</a> character.

<ul><li> This is an actual documented issue in ancient art history. Surviving <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_mummy_portraits">burial portraits from Roman Egypt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> resemble each other more than real people would.

Be even more amazed in the fact that he has been doing this for almost a <em>decade</em> and that his models range <em>from Belle to Lara Croft</em>.

</li><li> Much as with Classical Greek statues, Regency official portraits tended to all look alike, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">"because they're painted to a romantic ideal rather than as a true depiction of the idiosyncratic facial qualities of the person in question"</a>. Historically, this contributed to Prince George marrying Caroline of Brunswick, who so repelled him on actually meeting that he immediately begged off claiming to feel unwell (and Caroline wasn't very impressed with George either, which didn't help things). The whole marriage was such a disaster he attempted (unsuccessfully) to divorce her, and a good many of his relatives started desperately trying to produce an heir (when it became clear he was never going to have any legitimate children), eventually leading to Queen Victoria.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Archie</em> is relatively well-known for this, as a common story involves Betty or Veronica merely placing on a wig to imitate the other, leaving every other character completely fooled. In fact, the only female characters in Archie Comics not to have the same body and face type are either older women, the rare 'super-attractive' types such as Cheryl Blossom or Melody, who possess larger busts and more curves, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonks</a> like Big Ethel.
</li><li> In one comic, Betty and Veronica both dyed their hair red. Aside from hair <em>style</em>, they looked identical.
</li><li> It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">varies</a> from artist to artist. Sometimes Cheryl Blossom and Melody have the same body as every other girl. Cheryl Blossom is lucky enough to get a slightly different face most of the time, though. In the early comics before the series developed its signature style, the two looked more different as well.
</li><li> It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie">Afterlife with Archie</a></em>, as Francesco Francavilla manages to give every character a distinctive face and body. His Betty and Veronica are quite different (with Betty being taller, bustier and less slender than Ronnie), and it only diversifies from there.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015">Archie Comics (2015)</a></em> reboot, where more effort is given to distinguish Betty and Veronica.
</li></ul></li><li> This was initially the case for the original black and white releases of the first volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a>,</em> with characters like Scott, Ramona, Stacie, Kim and Young Neil sharing much of the same features and having similar head shapes despite being completely different characters, with much of the differentiation between the cast coming through their hairstyles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Bryan Lee O'Malley's art style changed</a> over the course of the series, however, and most of the cast's looks diversified with at least one unique facial characteristic for each character (Knives having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">Black Bead Eyes</a>, Kim being the only one with prominent freckles, etc.) by the fourth volume. The color rereleases of the series also make some minor visual changes along the way to keep things consistent (e.g. adding Julie's glasses from the later books into the first volume).
<ul><li> O'Malley's later work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Seconds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Seconds">Seconds</a></em> averts the trope entirely. Compare <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/41/19/344119a8b7c34d80bb807c9c72d89ca8.jpg">an early shot form volume one of Scott Pilgrim<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to the <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/51/5f/2c/515f2c55eb8d88d481a5d58e3b7bc24d.jpg">promotional image from Seconds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, and the difference is a clear one.

His <em>other</em> characters, on the other hand, are so varied and diverse that it almost makes up for it.
<ul><li> This is an improvement on how he drew people in the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> (and other comics of the time)—one letters column admitted his eight basic types bore an unofficial nickname, "Kirby's Kast of Kharacters."
</li><li> Jack Kirby had four basic categories of faces: Heroic Adult Male, Heroic Juvenile Male, Heroic Female (aka Juvenile Male with Long Hair), and Kill It With Fire. There <em>was</em> some variety among the Kill It With Fire crowd; Thing looked nothing like Desaad who looked nothing like Dan Turpin; each of them was hideous in his own distinctive way.
</li><li> In an early issue of <em>Fantastic Four</em>, this was even a plot point. By simply putting on a wig and a spare FF uniform, blind sculptress Alicia Masters <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/06/18/ten-goofiest-plot-points-of-the-first-ten-issues-of-the-fantastic-four/">looked exactly like Sue Storm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yz18');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yz18" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yz18');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">See item #6.</span> — to other characters, as well as the reader!

This is especially noticeable when his Batman and Superman are on the same page: the two of them are twins who happen to wear different costumes. He averts this in the <em>Generations</em> graphic novels, starring Superman and Batman, because he draws Batman with the distinctive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice">Lantern Jaw</a> that he sported back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>.

<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">the Golden</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Ages</a>, Superman would run into lookalikes often - from his Kandorian cousin Van-Zee to Kryptonian rogue Mala to a movie actor called Gregory Reed - who were <em>so</em> similar to him that they could (and did) pass for him. Superman and Batman were also able to pose as each other with <em>no one</em> figuring it out until they explicitly identified themselves. This was an intentional plot point: Superman is just supposed to have "one of those faces", which helps to explain his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a>.
</li><li> It wasn't just Superman - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> encountered identical duplicates of themselves on a semi-regular basis, too. Villain Lesla-Lar was capable of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnknownSupergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnknownSupergirl">posing as Supergirl</a> -and later Lena Thorul- without Superman himself suspecting that woman wasn't his cousin (several years later it was lampshaded in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanFamily">Superman Family</a> #206: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersAtTheHeartsCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersAtTheHeartsCore">Strangers At The Hearts Core</a></em> as some kind of "cosmic coincidence").
</li><li> Editor Mort Weisinger actually claimed (in response to a reader questioning the plausibility of this) that "it was a real-world fact that everybody on Earth has one or more exact lookalikes running around!" (The "everybody has a double" thing was a common urban legend, decades ago, but not so much these days.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TinyTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TinyTitans">Tiny Titans</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a> and Raven point out that without his hat, Zachary Zatara looks <strong>exactly</strong> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a>.
</li><li> Tom Grummett's characters tend to all have the same face. This makes it awkward when drawing characters who are romantically involved, such as Superboy and Wonder Girl, or Mach-IV and Songbird.
</li><li> Mark Bagley is a major offender, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>.</em> He is often forgiven for this because he is an inhumanly fast penciller - in an era where comic fans are used to delays, Bagley has a habit of getting issues out early. Plus he used this to astounding effect in the Ultimate Clone Saga, wherein Peter's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> really does look exactly like him, only female</span>. Though Bagley does repeat his faces, they look much more like each other than any other character. Similarly, the Ultimate Richard Parker was immediately recognizable as the 616 version of Peter Parker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> was a rare aversion. Wendy Pini kept a concordance of the shapes of eyes, facial structure, etc., so that her elves definitely weren't the same faces with different (extremely elaborate) hairdos. Although elves are all slender and have bodies that are considered attractive in this culture, there was a lot of variation in that shapeliness, on the men and especially the women.
</li><li> Greg Land is infamous not only for apparently tracing his characters from <strike>porno magazines</strike> photos, but also for tracing entirely different characters from the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rzdB5a4kLAo/R8C7U5yROCI/AAAAAAAAFqs/d5hF_z5q2Xw/s1600-h/GregLand_JeanBlkCanary.gif">same<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em> photo. There have been quite a few joke campaigns to buy Land more porn just so comic readers can see some variety in his work
</li><li> Ed Benes tends to give every female character more or less the same face. This is especially noticeable in his Justice League comics, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a> look like blond/brunette versions of each other, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vixen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vixen">Vixen</a>, a black woman, has identical facial features to them.
</li><li> David Aja pokes fun at himself over this in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a></em>. Clint gets mistaken for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ImmortalIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ImmortalIronFist">Iron Fist</a> (whose book Aja used to draw), and angrily asks why everyone keeps getting the two of them confused.
</li><li> A big problem for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDillon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDillon">Steve Dillon</a>, who draws faces very distinctively and very uniformly. Sadly this wasn't always the case, Dillon is an excellent draftsman, but even he has admitted to oversimplifying things in his work. This resulted in the "everyone is Frank" meme - because Dillon's work on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> was so famous, Frank Castle's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">scowly mug</a> is most noticeable when Dillon makes use of it or tries to modify it, including women, especially when they get mad they turn into skinny Frank Castles in wigs.
<ul><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/10/22/comics-people-remember-steve-dillon/">an article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> written after his passing, Dillon not only knew about the "Frankface" meme, but was actively trying to fuel it by putting it in everything he drew.
</li></ul></li><li> Phil Noto also does this for his characters, but makes it so pretty. Ditto Jim Cheung, Olivier Coipel, Stuart Immonen ...
</li><li> David Lafuente averts this. He gives all the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> distinct faces, hairstyles, dress styles, and rarest of all, physical builds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artesia">Artesia</a></em>. It's more like two - one for men and one for women. Mark Smylie paints almost everything with great detail - human faces being the exception. There are certain variations, like slightly wider noses, wrinkles and scars. The only way to really tell the characters apart is hair and facial hair. With the Ensemble Cast, it sometimes makes things confusing. The old Artesia website used to have a Character Sheet, but the new one does not.
</li><li> Maybe not faces, but for Kevin Maguire, it's expressions. Look at Superbuddies or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">JLI</a> runs and you'll see the same confused expressions on the faces of the JLI.
</li><li> Franco Urru's art on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> spin-off comics - his male characters are pretty individual but his women's faces and bodies are quite interchangeable. Particularly annoying since many of the characters are based on live-action actors who don't look alike - if you're drawing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietLandau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietLandau">Juliet Landau</a> with voluptuous curves, you're really letting your personal tastes influence your art too much.
</li><li> Charlie Adlard's art for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> is especially bad with this, at least in the beginning of his tenure. He seems to have one stock "Unshaven White Guy With Large Nose and Scowl" face that he uses constantly for at least three or four different main characters, and most of the women (and Glen) are only identifiable by their hair and/or hats. In shots that just show the face, the reader has little clue who they're looking at, outside of the dialogue. On top of that, the range of expression for the vast majority of Adlard's characters is exactly one: semi-stoic serious face. This is especially notable since the first six issues were drawn by Tony Moore, who actually made all of the characters look very distinct from one-another, especially Lori (Rick's wife). Tony Moore being a complete and total aversion of this trope makes Charlie Adlard's work following Moore's departure all the more jarring, though he has visibly improved over time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MillieTheModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MillieTheModel">Millie the Model</a></em> often consciously imitated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> style and had many of the same artists, including Dan DeCarlo and Stan Goldberg. Unsurprisingly, the feature often shared this trope with Archie as well.
</li><li> Terry and Rachel Dodson draw a lot of similar faces (see quote page).
</li><li> Surprise! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a> goes here. Once, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.progressiveboink.com/2012/4/21/2960757/robliefeld3">"top 40 worst Rob Liefeld drawings" list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showcased a scan of two data profiles on two different characters; the faces were identical, and the blonde hairstyles nearly so. The list asked readers, for bonus points, to guess <em>which of the two was supposed to be Hispanic</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is often accused of taking this to the entire body. Many share a body and head type with Sonic, even if they're not hedgehogs. Many characters are distinguished by clothing elements, colored bodies, or hairstyle. This is part of the reason why the comics are immensely popular in the fan art community (one could make a drinking game out of browsing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> for recolors of Sonic). The body type is fairly easy to learn and since many characters design-wise could be dumbed down as 'different color Sonic with hair', novice artists often can fall back on tracing pages.
<ul><li> Former artist/writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders">Ken Penders</a>, after leaving the comic, had this trope levied at him over his echidna characters with people noting that they're all just Knuckles with clothes and more/less hair. It doesn't help that they're <em>still</em> like this even when he's retooling them for his own work.

</li><li> In the German comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Werner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Werner">Werner</a></em>: Brösel once revealed in an interview that his characters are mostly based on a very few faces with a very few variations. 
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiloManara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiloManara">Milo Manara</a> only draws one type of beautiful woman.

</li><li> Used intentionally in the comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sturmtruppen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sturmtruppen">Sturmtruppen</a></em>, where all the soldiers share the same body type, and so do the officers. Bonvi's point was to underline how much war "de-humanize" soldiers and turns them into an anonymous mass.
</li><li> Any interpretation of super heroes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexRoss">Alex Ross</a> will be super-detailed and almost photo-realistic... paintings of the exact same guy or girl, just in a different outfit (or painted green in the case of The Martian Manhunter, etc.)

</li><li> Takeshi Miyazawa's drawings tend to have a limited range of faces and body types.
</li><li> Frank Cho is somewhat infamous for this — especially noticeable since he copies his trademark "double-wide hips, toned wasp-waist/titanic jugs" combination onto every female character as well. Only the beefiest girls (She-Hulk, Valkyrie, Thundra...) fall away from this trademark look. The women are essentially clones with different hair. His male characters tend to differ quite dramatically, by contrast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderstandingComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderstandingComics">Understanding Comics</a></em>, Scott McCloud argues <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">not to poopoo </a>—as a deliberate choice, a simplistic art style makes the person, place or thing being depicted more universal and, in the case of characters, helps us read their emotions as well as identify with them.
</li><li> In the 2017 edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, it quickly becomes clear that while Kris Anka is very good at drawing a variety of clothing and hairstyles, he only uses a limited range of faces. This is particularly apparent in the "Best Friends Forever" arc, in which Molly, Abby, and Klara all have the same face, just with different eye colors and skin tones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics">Harvey Comics</a></em> has a tendency for this. It's especially noticeable with their human characters as they often have the same head shape, eyes and noses. This has lead to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">fan theory</a> that their most famous character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a>, is actually the ghost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a>.

They're also drawn in a very different style from the men and older women, with sensuously flowing lines (which is only an exaggeration of reality). The style has shifted somewhat over the years, but the theme hasn't. Two recurring examples are Ms. Buxley and Beetle's previous girlfriend, who look about as different as they can within this technique, but mostly it applies to the hundreds of usually nameless extras Killer and the other soldiers are typically drooling after. If a young woman is drawn any other way, she's almost without exception meant to be plain or ugly.
</li><li> All the younger men in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ApartmentThreeG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ApartmentThreeG">Apartment 3-G</a></em> tend to look alike, at least in the later years when Frank Bolle is the artist.

This resulted in two main things:

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a> being related to Phil, Prince of Insufficient Light.
</li></ul></li><li> Characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> are only differentiated by hairstyles and accessories. Andy even changed her hairstyle early on to make her look less like Paige.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> did this, to an extent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Less so</a> as the series progressed.
</li><li> Once George Wunder took over as artist for <em>Terry and the Pirates,</em> this was the rule, with all the characters — male or female — having the same face.
</li><li> The characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> show extremely little variation in face and body type, being to a large extent distinguished by hairstyle and iconic costume. If you look just at the faces, Franklin has Charlie Brown's face in dark (black and white) or brown (color), while Peppermint Patty has Chuck's face with six freckles (which is rather fitting, as she is in many respects his female counterpart).

Yes, even the female characters.
</li><li> Pixar actually did this again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars">Cars</a></em> where some of the background characters have the exact same vehicle body style!

</li><li> Overall, however, Pixar has been pretty good at averting this. Even when using the same model, they've been able to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">pretty unique characters</a>, whether they be background or main.
<ul><li> An example with this would be all non-hero monsters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity">Monsters University</a></em>. They designed about half a dozen different Bodies Eyes Limbs Etc, then implemented a process which could mix and match as well as alter the color and scale of each. The end result was the ability to generate hundreds if not thousands of varied monsters that each fell into a "family" based on which Body was used.

Deja vu, much? All the scenes were drawn from the exact same live-action source material (and, in some cases, Xeroxs of that material).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MeetTheRobinsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MeetTheRobinsons">Meet the Robinsons</a></em>, a few generic character models are used for minor roles and a few major characters are recycled. Art's model is used as a college student in the Another Believer montage and Franny's model is used for Lewis's mother. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">kinda creepy</a> if you think about it.
</li><li> In the Disney fandom this is called "Sameface Syndrome", a phrase which is commonly used as a criticism of face-recycling in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a>, often with detractors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>. It's likely due to being designed by the same artist; however, Rapunzel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em>, Ariel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em>, and Anna from <em>Frozen</em> have similarities.

He finally manages to identify Marty using the scar on Marty's rump from when Alex bit him in the first movie. In real life, each zebra's pattern of stripes is unique, like human fingerprints. However, it would be like trying to identify a human by using <em>only</em> the fingerprints through a magnifying glass, a task that would be quite difficult. To make matters worse, they're all voiced by Chris Rock, who voices Marty, and have the same general personality and speech patterns.
</li><li> Invoked by the filmmakers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Anomalisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Anomalisa">Anomalisa</a></em>. Michael suffers from the Fregoli Delusion, a rare syndrome in which the person believes that multiple people are the same person in disguise. With the exception of the eponymous Lisa, to Michael everyone appears to be the same generic white guy, the only variation being different clothing and hairstyles.
</li><li> In relation to Charles Schulz' style, this trope makes the much advertised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a> of the Little Red-Haired Girl's face in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePeanutsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePeanutsMovie">The Peanuts Movie</a></em> unintentionally humorous: after all the build-up, she looks just like all the other kids, albeit with a slightly smaller nose.

Barry, there are hardly any variations in character design. This isn't a problem usually, because in the <em>Graystripe's Adventure</em> series not very many characters appeared at the same time, but in crowd shots it's very problematic. It's especially hilarious in the gathering at the end when there are four cats in the crowd who look exactly like Ravenpaw.

<ul><li> Several of the Pre-Raphaelites (Dante Gabriel Rosetti comes to mind) feature this, because they tended to have a few go-to female models they used for most of their pictures. The portraits could be more accurately titled "[Model] as/in the guise of [Goddess/Mythological Figure]".
<ul><li> Edward Burne-Jones only does one face, usually from the same angle (three-quarters profile) with the same long thick neck and broad shoulders. When it's supposed to be male he puts a beard on it and covers up the neck with armor. It's Janey Morris (his model) plays everyone in the universe. Particularly pronounced in his stained-glass windows in Birmingham St Chad's, where Janey Morris is Jesus, the Madonna and the hosts of heaven.

This is most obvious with the more distinctive ones such as Fat Blue (Simon Soundman, the customer in the Grover waiter sketches, Dad Twiddlebug) and Orange Gold (Guy Smiley, Don Music, Prince Charming).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oobi">Oobi</a></em>: Since all of the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">literal hand puppets</a>, the crew had to find creative ways to make sure the characters <em>didn't</em> all have the same face.

Sometime in the 90s they decided to use more different prints (like bearded man, guy with sunglasses, etc.). They do new faces regularly, but lines like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGOCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGOCity">City</a> are still plagued with this - for example most of the policemen have the same grumpy expression, and there seems to be only three different female head prints; this is possibly justifiable in how City figures are supposed to be generic everymen with no designated characterisation. Conversely, licensed themes handle this better because the main characters need to be identifiable, but they still spam the more generic-looking heads like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> one (who accordingly was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">a Nazi, a Communist</a>, his own son Harry, <em><strong>and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">the goddamn Batman</a></strong></em>) for mooks and guards.

Virtually every mask introduced after the beginning was a one-off for the characters on whom they were used, with very rare exceptions, while almost everyone else still just had the same original twelve. Also, underneath the masks? The same four or five head pieces, further exacerbated by the first film trilogy which made all the heads the same — but at least background extras weren't "allowed" to wear the same mask types as the main characters.
<ul><li> This later became a problem when masks became the only unique part of the toys. After the Inika line, almost all Toa-level figures had a standard template for how they're built. While some of them are visually different, construction-wise they were all nearly the same, and a simple armor swap can make one Toa look like another (or a bad guy). Adverted with the Barraki and Mistika Makuta lines, who all had unique construction making them vastly different from each other, even in the same line (the Barraki, in fact, were only similar in the construction of their "skull", while the Mistika Makuta had nothing in common at all).
</li></ul></li><li> On Bara Magna, every character used the same headpiece, and not all of them had helmets that covered their face. The youthful and overactive Berix even wore the same type of face-revealing helmet as the veteran, "beyond his prime" Ackar, so aside from their colors, their heads looked the exact same. The movie of that year only made things worse: due to CGI shortcuts, every character belonging to the same tribe looked the same, whether they were mere extras or plot-relevant characters.
</li><li> In <em>BIONICLE</em>, the recycling of masks reached its most bothersome level in 2006 and 2007. In '06, the six Matoran sets were given the exact same masks in the exact same colors as the Toa Metru from '04 (okay, Dalu's was half a shade lighter), not recolors, which annoyed the mask-collectors quite a bit. They released a figure called Umbra the same year, who again was given one of those six masks, meaning that LEGO passed the chance to release a recolored mask twice under a year. In '07, the toy of Sarda was likewise given a standard Toa Metru mask. What's strange is that all the other reused masks of that year were recolors, and even Idris, who came packaged with Sarda, was given recolored mask for some added collectible value.
</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> line. Clone troopers are meant to all have the same face, and LEGO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">used the same face for the Boba Fett figurine</a>. However, they also gave the same face to all other Mandolorians and the Senate Commandos, who are specifically stated to NOT be clones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels">Mixels</a></em> plays with the idea, too. While all the Mixels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">completely unique from each other</a>, the Nixels, their enemies, are simply black-and-white cube creatures, with the only difference being three different types of ear toppers. This ends up highlighting how uncreative the Nixels really are, in contrast to the Mixels' high creativity levels.
</li></ul></li><li> Minimate faces only have eyes and mouths, no noses, so they tend to look a lot alike. The Mobile Action Xtreme line takes this to new heights, with each two-pack of figures sharing one identical face.<a class="urllink" href="http://www.oafe.net/yo/maxmm_eh_fffc.php">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> toys have the same mold and only differ in color, hair, and symbol markings.
</li><li> For practical reasons this has been the case with most if not all doll lines, namely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirl">American Girl</a></em>, using a few stock face moulds depending on the doll's ethnicity or unique traits if any. The only other things distinguishing the dolls from each other is their hair, skin colour, outfit and their backstories.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> had many alien background characters cycle through the same small number of faces. It was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in-universe, when a Turian that didn't have much prior contact with humans couldn't tell what gender Shepard was, and later commented that humans "all look alike". The sequels brought more depth to character faces, but background characters still appeared with stock faces.
<ul><li> The books provide an in-universe explanation for this; apparently, as civilizations grow more advanced and globalized, increased interbreeding causes racial identifiers to begin to disappear as the gene pool becomes more evenly spread out. Advanced civilizations like the Turians and Asari have become so genetically homogeneous, there are very few physical differences between them. This is one of the reason why most Citadel species tattoo their faces - to make it easier for members of other species to differentiate between them. Humans are still young enough to show some racial diversity, but it's mentioned several times in the books that they are definitely becoming less visibly diverse than they once were.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> was little better. There was only one face for each race, and only a couple for humans. Even the player character could only select from a few stock faces, and could quite possibly run into a face clone. The second game also had as a plot point the fact that The Handmaiden looks different from her five otherwise identical sisters (given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> as being a trait of her species that makes all same sex siblings look alike) is a sign of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimacy</a>, not that you can tell since they all use the exact same model.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps somewhat understandably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> does this, with most races having only 8 faces per race/gender combination, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">palette-swapped</a> version of each face to give an alternate hair-color (the Tarutaru race has only 4 faces per gender, offering 4 sets of coloration per face instead of two). This is only a strict limitation on PCs and the quested NPC fellows (who were further limited to a subset of these), but even some story-important NPCs showed very little differentiation from these models (for example, Doctor Shantotto, who is Tarutaru Female face 4-A in relatively common mage gear, with some custom animations), and most general NPCs who are neither very young nor very old use the same faces as PCs. Also, each race/gender combination is identical from the neck down, with both sexes of Tarutaru being thus identical to each other as well.
<ul><li> This is a complaint with quite a few MMOs. Most MMOs without extensive character generators tend to have very few facial choices per sex/race combination. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, for example, tends to average somewhere around eight faces per sex/race combo, and usually only two of each of them look good enough to use most of the time. True, you can change hair color and shape, and facial hair, but that's really barely anything, and most of those favor heavily towards one style. Even one of the rare examples that shouldn't be, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, tends to lean towards this; while they have a lot, lot, LOT of options, only a few are really, honestly usable for "normal" looking characters. The rest are a bit too close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> half the time to be tolerable.
</li></ul></li><li> It's an awfully common thing for the awfully generic products that fill 90% of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sim</a> market. This is visible in almost everything, stock character designs, stock plots, stock character types, stock Photoshop glowing pink, etc. <a class="urllink" href="http://japanisnotoriginalatanime.ytmnd.com/">This YTMND animation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gives a really good example.
<ul><li> The characters featured in that animation are all designed by Naru Nanao; a couple of them even come from the same game. Her later designs vary a bit more.
</li><li> This also follows with anime based on h-games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AIR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AIR">AIR</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em>, etc.) which tend to have only <em>one</em> face — well, maybe two, one for boys and one for girls.
</li><li> Possibly the worst offender is Aoi Nishimata, possibly best known as one of the character designers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SHUFFLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SHUFFLE">SHUFFLE!</a></em>.

This includes several named characters who are part of the Student Council during Takako's plot.
</li></ul></li><li> A common source of mirth when talking about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> is how every guard or scientist in the Black Mesa complex has the same face (well, for scientists there are two alternating faces). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">This became more awkward when the models were given names and turned into unique NPCs in the sequel</a>. Maybe they were short on employees and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">clone themselves repeatedly?</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>, maker of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a> </em>(see above), has been the character designer for a number of games, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> and every single <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em>. And, true to form, nearly <em>every single character</em> in those games has a visual counterpart to be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>.
<ul><li> They even used the small variations in character designs as a central focus in the character design system of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>, where players could make hundreds of possible character models... using only about eight faces.
</li><li> In a couple of rare examples (such as <em>Dragon Quest Swords</em>, where none of the characters have spiky hair/Goku eyes, and a few are wearing decidedly Baroque-era or gothic outfits) he breaks out of the six faces mold, but when he phones it in (such as with <em>Tobal No. 1</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em>), it's really obvious that he is.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Backyard Baseball</em> and other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em> games, all characters, besides the 30 main ones, are based off of a few models.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> is often accused of succumbing to this trope. At least there's an in game excuse for all the characters that resemble each other in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> games. In <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> Sora, Kairi and Xehanort, each have several look-a-likes for various reasons. You can be certain that every single time you notice someone bears a physical resemblance to someone else, it will be significant. This is so rampant in the series that it almost <em>wasn't</em> a surprise when we found out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vanitas looks like Sora</span>. So far, Riku is the only core member of the main cast to not have a doppelganger, unless you count the Riku Replica.
</li><li> Almost every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">The Advent Children</a></em>, characters in CG movies tend to look very similar. This expands to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> above and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals</a></em>.
</li><li> The girls of the hentai <em>Bible Black</em> are not only limited to a single face, they all have the same body figure, and CGs featuring more of them will clearly show that they all have the same heights. It's like they are all clones with different hair and accessories.
<ul><li> The anime series mostly attempts to avert this, as the character designer seems to have done their best at making the women as distinguishable as possible from one another. Character models show that, at least for the named characters, they attempted giving each male and female different figures and body types, and all of them are different heights. This is not completely averted however, as certain characters do look quite a bit alike and un-named background characters are sometimes identical to others.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Hitman: Blood Money</a></em> has this in <strong>spades</strong>, due to technical limitations of 2006 not allowing IO Interactive to easily make unique face models for every NPC. Naturally, this makes it incredibly easy to exploit.
<ul><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016">HITMAN (2016)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2">HITMAN 2</a></em> downplay this trope, as while guards tend to look identical to one another, civilians are so numerous that it's inevitable twins will start popping up. It's downplayed as there's <em>at least</em> 20 face models for each gender, as well as skin color variants, as well as many different types of clothing, hair, and any gear they wear (such as watches or backpacks), meaning even if a face is the same as another NPC in a level, their hair or body likely isn't.
</li></ul></li><li> The guys of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a></em> are easy to tell apart, but the girls all have the same vaguely-childlike face, and the same build. It gets even more noticeable when you look at Team Ninja's fanart of Chun-Li and Cammy, though they tone down the former's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips">Hartman Hips</a>. Close inspection reveals that there are, in fact, <em>two</em> female models in the game, the tall, incredibly well-endowed Caucasian, and the petite, yet still incredibly well-endowed Asian (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">half-Asian</a>).
<ul><li> Curiously, the older DOA titles used a 'trick' to get around this to a limited degree: character heights that varied (particularly among women) much more than other 3D fighters, where women overwhelmingly tend to be the same height. In particularly, shorter fighters have a handy advantage of ducking under attacks more easily, since their reach is rarely affected as well.
</li><li> <em>Dead or Alive 5</em> (and afterwards) made a point of giving the female cast different face models, which siblings most closely resembling each other, finally catching up, and advertised the fact. It also introduced Marie Rose, who, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">Token Mini-Moe</a> (a first for the series), looks <em>noticably</em> different from everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> Ufotable's work for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> suffers greatly from this, even with non-affiliated artists creating the character designs. Look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Alvin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Zaveid</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Milla</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Velvet</a>, for example.
</li><li> Akihiko Yoshida is notorious for this. Almost every character he designs (particularly in games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> and sequels, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> (DS)) has the same face, albeit with a few characteristics. It's quite an accomplishment when even some of the males and females look the same. The biggest culprit here is that he rarely gives the characters <em>noses</em>. It is really difficult to differentiate characters when one of the biggest facial features is just missing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> had this bad. A very obvious shortcoming of the game's graphics department was that there were only one or two models for merchants, old ladies, old men, hookers and so on, as a result of which most NPCs of a particular type looked like identical twins. This stands out even more because even named and important NPCs share some of these repetitive models.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1">The Sims</a></em>, there are only about 8 faces and 3 skintones (dark, medium, light) to choose from for each gender and age group (adult or child). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3">3</a></em>, this is changed and the "Create A Sim" options are greatly improved. However, in <em>The Sims 2</em>, the NPC's or Townies often only have faces from the pre made faces in CAS, leading to various nicknames by fans (e.g. the mailwoman Dagmar Bertino has "Face 1", which is considered to be the prettiest face).
</li><li> Players sometimes invoke this by only allowing Face 1 and Face 2 townies to marry and breed with their playable sims, leading to challenge families where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar">You All Look Familiar</a>.

Even many quite-well characterized NPCs were virtual clones of a stock model. Protagonists were frequently not exempt, with one build, one basic outfit, and one face for the male and female of every race. Customization came down to hair, skin, and clothing colors. Despite this, major characters often had impressively detailed rich portraits.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that they're unused concept art and non-final character designs for the same characters. This is here because there were plans and potential to use a number of forgotten Disney characters and stands out more because the plot-important characters look wildly different from each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioshock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioshock2">Bioshock 2</a></em> has this with the little sisters in the final cutscene (good ending).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> offers about 8 or 9 face options per race/gender. While many of the male faces get used, female faces are rarely used unless they're one of the couple of youthful, smooth faces available for that race, making female characters more likely to look like clones of eachother.
<ul><li> One particular troll female face is known as "cutefase" (note spelling). Whereas other troll faces have wrinkles, deepset lines, and cranky expressions, cutefase is young, smooth, and appears either deadpan or "under the influence." Virtually all female trolls will use this face. The term cutefase is often also applied to an orc female face with smooth features and the forsaken female face that lacks visible decay (the last of which is also called the "dollfase").
</li><li> Female tauren and worgen faces are notoriously difficult to distinguish from one another. This is further exacerbated by the fact that all female worgen have pale green eyes and the same expression, while female tauren only have <em>four</em> non-death-knight-specific options.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a></em> series is a big offender when it comes to non-human characters. All characters who are Toads, Goombas, Koopa Troopas, etc. tend to have exactly the same face and body, sometimes being distinguished by their clothes or facial hair (or, in some Koopa Troopas' cases, shell color). And all Yoshis look exactly the same except for their color scheme (and many times, even the colors repeat). While all members of a species looking the same makes sense when they're enemies, it gets annoying when you're dealing with actual characters: It's impossible to tell if you're looking at the "main" Toad or a generic one, or whether the green Yoshi Mario rides through the different games in the series is always the same one. And the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADogNamedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADogNamedDog">the names of the "main" Toad and Yoshi are just "Toad" and "Yoshi" respectively</a> doesn't help, either. Another example would be Kamek, who exactly looks like every other Magikoopa, with the only difference that he has a broom.
<ul><li> The saddest part regarding the Toads is that there was an attempt to avoid this trope in the first two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64">Paper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Mario</a> games that boast <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/a/HCB1SEC">a fair share of unique designs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Unfortunately, both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Sticker Star</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash">Color Splash</a></em> did not follow.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>: Not only is ZUN susceptible to this with his famously crappy character art (which arguably got worse in this regard from the shift between PC-98 into Windows), but so are some of the official manga artists, such as Aki Eda (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouBougetsushou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouBougetsushou">Silent Sinner in Blue</a>) and Makoto Hirasaka (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSangetsusei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSangetsusei">Touhou Sangetsusei</a>).
<ul><li> One step up in the fighting games. As far as Alphes's character portraits go, everyone has the same face. Moe Harukawa's character portraits show this as well, with only one or two characters looking even <em>slightly</em> different.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster">THE iDOLM@STER</a></em> - All the girls are distinguished only by their hair, body types and eye color. The face template for all of them is the same. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster">The anime</a> managed to make it less noticeable, though.
<ul><li> Technically untrue. While the character models are mostly the same, every idol has a different eye shape (For example: Takane has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes">Tsurime Eyes</a>, while Yayoi has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaremeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaremeEyes">Tareme Eyes</a>), and the faces become longer the older the idol is. (So an older idol like, say, Azusa has a longer face than a younger idol like Iori or Ami.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Arthur's Quest: Battle for the Kingdom</em>, at least according to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/game-reviews/arthurs-quest-battle.php">review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "You start out in....some town, somewhere. But this is a special clone town, one that's populated by about 12 people with about 3 or 4 unique looks. You'd think they would have at least bothered to make a few more models, or at least position the people so that identical twins aren't standing right next to each other."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> does this oddly. There are dozens of unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPortrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPortrait">character portraits</a>... but with each random NPC getting one from this selection, they get repetitive anyway, with it not helping that the portraits are always the same, not modified slightly the way characters in a work with this usually can be.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> had it worse. While you got some variance in character models and faces, any time you talked with someone who got a voice (as opposed to simply using a text box), the camera would zoom in on you and the other character. There was only a single set of animations for all characters, so everyone in the conversation would go through the same pattern of head-tilt, eye-roll, hand-wave, head-tilt, eye-roll, hand-wave...
</li></ul></li><li> Almost averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, since most of the inhabitants of Hyrule City fit this trope perfectly.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> games, a given NPC is usually generated by picking from a list of roughly half a dozen faces per race and assigning a race-appropriate name from a similar list. Major characters such as Saya Kho sometimes get their own face. Returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth">X Rebirth</a></em> where there is only about a dozen character models. However, alternate uniforms, attachments such as hats and eyeglasses, and alternate voices and personalities make it somewhat less obvious.
</li><li> Save for Campbell, Dr. Betruger, Counselor Swann, Theresa Chasar and Sergeant Kelly, the NPC's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em> have all the exact same Asian, middle-aged white or young white male faces. There are two black males in the first level, though, but that could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">as them being twins</a>.

Shizuna thinks the same about the Gundam-faces.
</li><li> Former SNK and current Capcom artist, "Shinkiro", possesses an almost photo-realistic (if slightly creepy) art-style. The thing is, all his characters have more or less the same face and their expressions seem limited to "serious", "creepy grin" and "manic grin".
</li><li> The 2005 video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWarriors">The Warriors</a></em> has all gangs except the Warriors (who have the protagonist cast and 9 "New Bloods) use just 9 different characters, no more. Even then, in a lot of cases, one of the characters will be the gang's warlord who, as you'd expect only appears once, and as a boss, so apart from him/her, there are usually only 8 gang characters; what's more, you can often see several clones of the same character in one fight because you'll be fighting multiple gang members throughout the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixPathOfNeo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a></em> has this for all the minor NPC characters; those who are more important get a slightly different face along with different hairstyle/color and/or such.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lampshaded at one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. An NPC in New Reno describes a man the Chosen One has to find. Chosen remarks that he keeps seeing the same faces everywhere. The NPC hypothesizes that such poor genetic diversity is the result of the nuclear war. <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> have around 5 sprite sets for unarmoured townsmen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter">FalloutShelter</a></em> all Dwellers look the same expect color and hairstyle, even those from the other Fallout games.
</li><li> Generally a criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>. The game's engine meant that faces tended to not have much variation, and didn't emote much. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> fixed these problems, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">although fans still found fault with it</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kairosoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kairosoft">Kairosoft</a> games are guilty of this, in order to keep the size of their games down, to fit with their 16-bit retraux theme, and the fact that there's only 9 employees in the company including the boss.
<ul><li> Their game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketStables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketStables">Pocket Stables</a></em> is the perhaps the worst offender of this trope, by having every guest that visits your farm appear indistinguishable from the others of their class type. All students look alike, as do all gardeners, salarymen, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a></em> is a glaring example, and it's especially grating when contrasted with the rest of its otherwise awesome graphics. The game's female cast has exactly three members (Lara, Ana, Sofia), none of them related by blood, all of them from wildly different backgrounds and origins, and yet all of them look so alike one could be forgiven for thinking they were sisters. The only things that really tell them apart are their clothes and their hair color. The men fare slightly better, with the main cast having unique faces and most of the mooks wearing masks anyway, but Jonah's likeness is recycled for Trinity's soldiers on a regular basis, and the Remnant fighters also tend to look like a nearby cloning facility left its doors open.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em>'s debug builds have only two faces, as a result of having only two character models (Yandere-chan's for the girls and Senpai's for the boys). The dev wants to avert this in the final game, and has given some students unique features (The Student Council members have their own eye shapes, and several attempts have been made to give Mai Waifu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaremeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaremeEyes">Tareme Eyes</a>).
</li><li> All the moles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MolesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MolesWorld">Mole's World</a></em> series (with the sole exception of the villain, Kula) have the same basic face design, with two oval-shaped black eyes, a red nose, and a mouth with one tooth visible when opened.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood">Achewood</a></em> falls into this trope at times. Since the introduction of Ray, Pat, and Roast Beef, it has been revealed that the majority of the animal population are cats (dogs have been established as typically non-anthropomorphic and excluded from the animal underground.) In keeping with Onstad's generally minimalist art style, most of the cats are interchangeable in terms of facial features. There are three or four body types, and a couple of heads to go with them, and generally the eyes, muzzle and ears of the cats are exactly the same (exceptions being Ray and his family, as well as his ex-current-ex-business partner-ex-girlfriend Tina, who have been identified as American Curls.)

Ironically, it used to be praised for <em>not</em> falling into this trope, before people started really paying attention and notice that most characters have the same insane look on their faces as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">art evolved.</a> It could be related to the fact that he is obviously relying on his computer a lot more. While Leo and Aeris did always look like essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">palette swapped</a> versions of each other, it can be pointed out that the different facial expressions often look very similar now, I.E. pissed off character A looks like pissed off characters B, C, and D, or at least a lot more than before.

The faces are male and female, differentiated by the position of the eyes and mouth (women have both positioned lower on the face, suggesting more delicate features and smaller chins; the difference is showcased by the storyline in which Roy uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Belt of Gender Changing</a> and his features shift accordingly). However, in this case the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">trope is justified</a> because they're, well... stick figures. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Xykon</a> is the only member of the cast who completely stands out, as he is a skeleton.
<ul><li> Even that variation gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when Redcloak creates some Xykon decoys by getting some skeleton monsters and dressing them up like him.

</li><li> Many of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins">Jack</a></em> are essentially the same model with different markings. It's very hard to tell what species some of them are meant to be without being told (Arloest is a panda; Farrago is a ferret; it's hard enough to tell them apart, let alone discern their respective species).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Concession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Concession">Concession</a></em> was originally like this, with cat, mouse, wolf and <em>pangolin</em> looking almost exactly alike. After being called out on this several times, the artist initially excused it by saying that a more realistic pangolin face would look ugly, but later redesigned the characters to look more distinct from each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd">xkcd</a></em>, with the exception of a handful of early pieces, tends to have <em>zero</em> faces. For a long time, the only body types were male (circle-headed stick figure), female (circle-headed stick figure with hair), and the recurring characters Black Hat Guy and White Beret Guy. Later comics added more hairstyles, but still no faces.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QueenOfWands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QueenOfWands">Queen of Wands</a></em> had one face for almost all of the female characters besides Angela, and one for the male characters besides Felix, giving a generic sameness to Donna, who was supposed to be older and heavier (judging by spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PunchAnPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PunchAnPie">Punch an' Pie</a></em> with a different artist), and the various males in the background.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Housepets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Housepets">Housepets!</a></em> was prone to this during its first year; most of the characters looked alike, and it was difficult to tell cats apart from dogs. The strip underwent a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">art style revision</a> about nine months into its run, which significantly improved the situation, although there are still occasional hang-ups; for example, Peanut and Fido have <em>identical</em> faces.
</li><li> Dan Shive of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="http://egscomics.com/sketchbook/?date=2010-04-20">noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that three of the main female characters have the same face. He's tried to give each of them a little more individuality, but points out that changing their faces too much would mean they'd no longer look like the people they're supposed to be. He averts it a lot better with characters created later in the series.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYours">How I Became Yours</a></em> (as well as the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYoursRiseOfTheAgniArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HowIBecameYoursRiseOfTheAgniArmy">Rise of the Agni Army</a></em>) has this something terrible. Mostly because the artist traces her face over and over again, and only bothered to trace <em>one</em> character's face for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">OCs.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheWhiteboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheWhiteboard">The Whiteboard</a></em>, the humans (for the most part) only have <em>one</em> face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">The furry cast is more varied</a>... <a class="urllink" href="http://www.the-whiteboard.com/autotwbaf10.html">mostly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em> look strangely alike. Sometimes, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">Strong Family Resemblance</a> (Marten in particular seems to have inherited his mother's entire face). There's also the strip where it's pointed out how much Marten and Dora look alike (leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">incest and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">Your Mom</a> jokes.)
</li><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/APTComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/APTComic">APT Comic</a></em> has a habit of one face per species, to emphasis the rest of the differences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>'s simple style means that all the child characters have the same bodyshape and facial structure. This trend is carried over even into the more detailed shots.
<ul><li> Taken even further with the recent inclusion of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ectobiological parents of the original protagonists</span>, whose features are similar on purpose. The most extreme example thus far being <a class="urllink" href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/File:John_Egbert2.png">John<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="urllink" href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/File:Jake_English.png">Jake<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></span>, whose facial features are exactly the same.
</li><li> However, it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">inverted</a> to an extent— with the exception of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> John/Jake parallel</span> mentioned above and the obvious similarities between alternate sessions, each and every member of the cast has distinctive facial features and design, to the point where it's fairly simple to recognize characters even out of a huge crowd.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile">Misfile</a></em> has this issue with secondary characters: combined with the downright glacial progress of the story (not unheard of to spend two weeks of real-time covering one conversation) it can make it extremely difficult to remember who they're talking to sometimes...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Bricktown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Bricktown">Bricktown</a></em> simultaneously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> and plays this trope straight. All characters' eyes are large and circular, though women have proportionally-larger eyes than the men, and their faces are generally similar; however, among the cast of 10 main characters, they all have differently-sized and -shaped eyebrows, have noses of various sizes and basic shapes, unique irises, their individual facial proportions are all radically different, unique hair, and they all have uniquely-shaped heads <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oqpl');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oqpl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oqpl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For instance, while they both have trapezoidal-shaped noses: Greg has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows">Big Ol' Eyebrows</a>, a notably longer nose bridge, and sports a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice">a box-shaped head</a>; Jill, on the other hand, has a much shorter nose bridge, thinner eyebrows, and a spherical head.</span> Each character sports a unique body type, as well, (even muscular characters have different levels of bulk), and most have unique heights as well (of the main 10 characters, only 4 - Greg, Jen, Curt, and Randy - are of similar height). The result is that, even with the simple faces, it's incredibly easy to pick out which character is which, even when they have different clothes or hair than usual. And this was BEFORE the comic was colored in. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ostc');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ostc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ostc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Every character's skin is unique to them, so if all else fails, every character is effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">Colour-Coded for Your Convenience</a></span>
</li><li> A common criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FlutteringFeelings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FlutteringFeelings">Fluttering Feelings</a></em> is this. Characters tend to look very similar, even their hairstyles can look similar, and it can be confusing at times to tell people apart (especially if they haven't appeared for a while).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DumbRWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DumbRWBY">Dumb_RWBY</a></em> webcomic takes this to an absurd degree. Not only does everyone (save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Zwei</a> and Yatsuhashi) have the same face, but they all have the same constant facial expression. Granted, this is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">intentional</a>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamEllis">Adam Ellis</a> was accused of copy-pasting faces and expressions in his work while still at Buzzfeed, to the point that he would lampshade it in his own comics (ie, complaining about recolored sprites in video games to an identical but recolored Adam). Since leaving Buzzfeed, he's gotten better about not copy-pasting (he's no longer on a tight deadline and can work at his own pace), but his art style does suffer from same-faceness sometimes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HappyTreeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HappyTreeFriends">Happy Tree Friends</a></em>. This is an especially egregious case, being that most of the characters are different <em>species</em>. With few exceptions, nearly all the characters have flat faces, heart-shaped noses and buckteeth (including the carnivorans and ungulates) and are all the same size except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign">Lumpy</a>. You could say this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> though, considering the show's premise.
</li><li> Only <em>One</em> Face in the case of the main cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>, as the main characters are all wearing Spartan armor. The only exceptions are the occasional alien (who all look alike except for color and size), Andy, Sheila, and Vic. Season 9 averted this strongly when CGI was used heavily to show the faces of several different characters, all of whom looked quite distinct.
</li><li> Nekci, Kety Perr, Medoner, and Beyonce all share the same facial design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheNekciMenijShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheNekciMenijShow">The Nekci Menij Show</a></em>; in the same show, Rhenna, Keshir, and Lady Gags also share a similar facial design, though they are not identical.

(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">And Raquelle.</a>) Justified in that the series takes place in a community of living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel">Mattel</a> dolls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> runs into this with the crowd scenes in the second volume. While the main characters are all reasonably distinctive, the dance scenes and the assembly scene show several copies of some individuals in each shot. In the first volume background characters were featureless silhouettes.
</li><li> Every single character in object shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BattleForDreamIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BattleForDreamIsland">Battle for Dream Island</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/InanimateInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/InanimateInsanity">Inanimate Insanity</a></em> share the same face and limbs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/SanrioBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/SanrioBoys">Sanrio Boys</a></em> runs into this, in part from the art style borrowing from typical Shoujo manga aesthetics. Of the main boys, two of them have a half-lidded "serious" face, while the other three have a round, bright-eyed "playful" face. While this is downplayed somewhat in the blogs by depicting them with a wide variety of expressions, this is emphasized in the anime and visual novel adaptations, which standardizes their appearances.

<div class="indent"><strong>Stan:</strong> Let's go! <br/><strong>Kyle:</strong> I'm not going anywhere! <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuckSeasonRabbitSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuckSeasonRabbitSeason">Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!</a> <br/><strong>Kyle:</strong> Huh? I thought you wanted to leave! <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> Oh wait, who am I again? <br/><br/><strong>Stan:</strong> Kyle, I'm beginning to think this was a bad idea. <br/><strong>Butters:</strong> I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters, I thought you were Kyle. <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> No, I'm Stan. <br/><strong>Kyle:</strong> You're Stan? Where's Kenny? <br/><strong>Stan:</strong> Who are you? <br/><strong>Kyle:</strong> I'm Kyle! <br/><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Cartman</a>:</strong> Heheh, guess who I am, you guys!
</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Terrance and Phillip</a> episode, "Not Without My Anus", the character "Ugly Bob" wears a paper bag over his head. When he takes it off, he looks exactly like all the other characters, but they react as if he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity">traumatically hideous</a>.
</li><li> Cleverly lampshaded in the episode "The Coon", in which after spending the entire episode keeping the other characters<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3o9uf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3o9uf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3o9uf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only characters that Professor Chaos has crossed off his Mysterion identity list are the obvious ones: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Cartman</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged">Jimmy and Timmy</a></span> - and the audience - guessing as to his identity, masked vigilante "Mysterion" finally removes his mask, revealing him to be... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">completely indistinguishable from every other boy in the show.</a> Just to rub it in, the rest of the characters recognize him instantly, but don't say his name. Later episodes reveal him to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenny</span>.
</li><li> "Naughty Ninjas" has the boys starting a ninja club to keep homeless people away from Kenny's house. Cartman tries to convince everyone Kyle shouldn't be in the club and tries to discuss it with the others but he keeps confusing everyone because most of them look the same with their hoods on (the exceptions being Cartman due to his size, Token and David because of their skin tones, and Jimmy who has his crutches).
</li><li> Another episode has the girls create a league table of the boys' attractiveness... which is, naturally, entirely of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Informed</a> variety.
</li><li> Oddly enough, many of South Park's one-off characters are a complete aversion of this. The primary characters look similar because of a far more simplified character design from the early seasons, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">characters introduced later have unique head shapes, hairstyles, hair colors, mouths, and eyes</a> — they've got a ton of different Redneck characters that all look very distinct from one-another. Now, if there were a trope for Only Six Voices... Wait there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">is</a>.
</li><li> In a particularly meta sequence in which the boys create an animated Christmas special featuring themselves (and which is represented by the original Spirit of Christmas special that served as a proto-pilot for the series), the boys react to the animated versions of themselves as though there were fine details that the audience is incapable of seeing:
<div class="indent"> "They <em>kind of</em> look like us. I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they <em>kind of</em> look like us."
</div></li><li> Possibly the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> however came in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> magazine parody<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4unf8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4unf8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4unf8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Cracked</em> used to be a parody mag akin to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad">MAD</a></em> before it became a humor website</span>. At one point in the comic, the characters go to a beach to gather sand to throw into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">a giant butt threatening their town</a>, but due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a> trope, they overheat in their winter clothing and faint. They all wake up naked in a hospital bed, and the Stan and Kyle expies (who both have the exact same hair, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedByCanon">the show had not revealed how they actually looked without their hats at the time</a>) can no longer tell which of them is which. The Cartman expy suggests they look under the covers, since "Kyle" is Jewish. You can work out the joke from there.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a>'s simplified art style post-BTAS has shades of this, especially the generic 'male' body shape used for otherwise very different characters.
<ul><li> Very apparent in <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> in the few rare instances when Batman takes off his mask and looks nearly identical to Superman.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> (we hope) in the Superman episode "Knight Time", where Superman is able to 'be' Batman by putting on his costume and disguising his voice. Several characters do wonder, though, whether Batman seems taller all of a sudden. Which is a joke considering that in their previous crossover episodes, Superman and Batman are the same height.
</li><li> Also lampshaded in this dialog:
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman</strong>: Do I look like Batman to you? <br/><strong>Flash</strong>: Yeah, you kinda do, especially when you get all scowly like that.
</div></li><li> Even more evident with the female characters. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> eventually broke out of this, with broad-shouldered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> and realistically-built <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmandaWaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmandaWaller">Amanda Waller</a>, but earlier efforts had "Bruce Timm Generic Female #2" for almost every distaff character. This is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked">Shortpacked!</a></em>, when Batman studies video footage of a female criminal, before concluding that, since the hair isn't visible, she's impossible to identify.
</li></ul></li><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheNewAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheNewAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</a></em> had six background characters that were continuously reused in different contexts. Sometimes they even played different "roles" in the same episode.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, every girl has the exact same body, head, and face shapes. If it weren't for the vastly different hairstyles, clothes, and colors you wouldn't be able to tell any of them apart. The background characters also fall victim to this, to the point where one character could be both a witch and a fairy. Sometimes it was just the same character with a different hairstyle while other scenes had repeated, recolored characters to fill out the masses; Shilly (a witch from Cloud Tower who featured a few times in the comics) makes an appearance (in a blue dress instead of a red one) in Season 4 as "Sally", one of Mitzi's friends. Not even the Winx escaped; there was a brown-haired Bloom in a crowd at Redfountain in season two.
<ul><li> Some characters are copied exactly. Priscilla (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedheadInGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedheadInGreen">a red-headed girl in an all-green outfit</a>) appears in both Alfea and Cloud Tower, leading many early fans of the show to believe that there was a pair of twins attending both schools. And Darma (Mitzi's fuschia-haired lackey in Season 4) showed up regularly in background shots from Cloud Tower, leading to a debate over whether or not she's actually a witch; the Cloud Tower version was never named or even spoken to (like most of the characters at Cloud Tower), so it's entirely possible that it really was her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> uses this relentlessly, with most child or teenage characters having the exact same face, with the possible variations only extending to two different types of noses and two different types of eyebrows. Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, Vicky, Chip Skylark, Chester, Trixie, Veronica and many more suffer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> parodies this within a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em> parody.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Girl:</strong> Which one's Josh? All the guys here kinda look like the same generic douche. <em>(pan to show more partygoers; all the male ones shown share the same face)</em>
</div></li><li> Also happens with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanMaximum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanMaximum">Titan Maximum</a></em>, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>-styled series. Just watch the fight in the second to last episode. The same guy gets an ass-kicking no less than three times, two of those being at the same time in different spots.
</li><li> A lot of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> follow this pattern, including Sector V, Numbuhs 86 and 362 and The Delightful Children From Down The Lane, excluding the tall, lanky one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MakingFiends">Making Fiends</a></em>. Vendetta has slightly distinguishable facial features and expressions from the others, especially in the webisodes, but the only difference between everyone else's faces is that they have either a pointed nose or a rounded nose. Also, the adults have the exact same faces as children (unless they have mustaches), so there's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging">Animation Anatomy Aging</a> to diversify.
</li><li> Becomes extremely evident in most crowd shots seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> where there are actually duplicates of the same people!
</li><li> A lot of animals from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DingoPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DingoPictures">Dingo Pictures</a> cartoons are constantly reused for their films.
</li><li> The religious-themed video series produced by Richard Rich's studio post-<em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess">The Swan Princess</a></em> feature characters that are almost visual clones of that movie's characters.
</li><li> In <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>, the same characters repeatedly walk behind the main characters in school.
</li><li> Nearly every incarnation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> has featured a cast of identical ponies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">distinguished only by their colors</a>, because all the toys used the exact same mold. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">1980s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3">2000s</a> series, they even often had the same hairstyle. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Friendship is Magic</a></em> gave the main characters unique eyes and hairstyles, but their face shapes and bodies are identical to most every other pony. Stallions were given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics">larger, more angular snouts</a> and are visibly larger. Some characters were designed with entirely unique heads, bodies, and/or facial features, most of which were recycled into new background extras in season two.
<ul><li> Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls">Equestria Girls</a> counterparts are similar, differing eyes and hairstyles but otherwise similar faces.
</li><li> Oddly inverted with Trixie, who originally had a <a class="urllink" href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/File:Trixie_casting_her_magic_S1E06.png">unique eye and horn design<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vt03');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vt03" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vt03');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She had eyelashes used only by her and Mayor Mare, only one reflection in her eye, and a fatter longer horn than typical unicorns</span> but as of <em>To Where And Back Again</em> has been given a <a class="urllink" href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/File:Starlight_%22magically_stole_everypony%27s_cutie_marks%22_S6E25.png">more standard design<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> shared by countless characters.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one episode when Ember is unable to tell Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer apart, remarking how they look and act exactly the same. It also doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialFaceBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialFaceBlindness">Racial Face Blindness</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a very common complaint about the female character designs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, especially where facial structure is concerned. If not for the differing skin/hair/eye colours, about 90% of the female characters would be identical in appearance. You know it's bad when Batgirl and M'gann or Dinah and Cassie look like they could be siblings as civilians.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonHertzfeldt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonHertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a>'s cartoons, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsSuchABeautifulDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsSuchABeautifulDay">it's such a beautiful day</a></em>.
</li><li> Comes up in many of the incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, since so many characters are re-colors of other characters. This finally was addressed in <em>Transformers: Animated</em>, when it was explained that there were a few particular "body types" that were common, explaining why there were dozens of extras that looked like different colored Bumblebees and Arcees.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> most of the females share a similar face. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em> comic reboot averts this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">making the designs more diverse</a>.
</li><li> Every character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JOT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JOT">JOT</a></em> shares not only the same face, but the same body design (a white circle with hands and feet). The only difference is that most of the characters have hair to differentiate them from the main character, Jot, who doesn't have hair.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some people suffer from a disorder called prosopagnosia (also called Face Blindness), the inability to differentiate between faces. To these people, real life people all look the same (barring hair color, skin pigmentation, body shape and very specific details such as scars). The fact that Real Life people generally don't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">distinctive outfit</a> or hairstyle makes interacting with people extremely confusing for people suffering from prosopagnosia.
<ul><li> A limited form of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity">foreigner face blindness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can occur as both an actual phenomenon (as the distinguishing features of an unfamiliar group may be different) or psychological (not bothering to look for any differences).
</li></ul></li><li> Members from a certain family will look like each other; such as <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Paus_family_portrait_NFB-18645.jpg/800px-Paus_family_portrait_NFB-18645.jpg">the family in this photo for example<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
