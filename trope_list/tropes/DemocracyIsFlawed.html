The danger of defending democracy on those grounds is that they are not true...I do not deserve a share in governing a hen-roost much less a nation. Nor do most people...The real reason for democracy is just the reverse. Mankind is so fallen that no man can be trusted with unchecked power over his fellows. Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters."</em>

They will point out the safeguard against tyranny it provides while pointing out that the influence of narrow interest groups, an unaware populace and a biased media can still lead to the people being manipulated into voting against their interests or even simply not having a candidate that represents their interests to choose. They will note that it allows the checking of unwise usage of power while at the same time leading to polarization and paralysis. The overall use of this trope is one that is in favour of democratic procedures (in fact, one of their main criticisms may be that the system isn't democratic <em>enough</em>) but that said procedures are still full of holes.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> spends a lot of time showing that democracy at is best is nowhere near as good as the best that can be done with an iron fist, but it also is unlikely to sink quite as low. The Free Planets Alliance is corrupt to the core, but people can still complain about it without being sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">The Gulag</a>. The Empire, in the meantime, can go from golden age to decadence all on the basis of who's in charge of it, and the rights of its citizens are tied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>'s whims. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reinhart eventually enshrines said rights with a constitution, but he couldn't have done so without taking supreme power in a coup.</span>

<ul><li> When Papa Smurf is away, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> argue who should be the new leader. In the first round of voting, everyone votes for himself. The second round ends with a Smurf elected (by making empty promises) who installs a monarchy with himself as the king.
</li><li> In the IDW <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">Transformers</a></em> G1 continuity, Optimus Prime eventually renounced Autobot dominance over Cybertron and allowed its citizens to elect a leader. They chose Starscream.
<ul><li> Starscream has since found himself somewhat beholden to the people he now rules, and the Council of Worlds that includes representatives from various colony worlds. He's unhappy about having to answer to people who have no idea what kind of stresses he's under to actually be a good leader, but surprisingly enough he actually is trying. If only to spite those who think he can't handle it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProjectSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProjectSuperpowers">Project Superpowers</a></em>, Boy King claims that the only time that democracy is preferable to a monarchy is if the throne is occupied by an unwise king, because otherwise, democracy just invites mob rule. Of course, since Boy King is the unelected monarch of a small Eastern-European country, he may be a bit biased.
</li><li> While the democratization of the world in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> animated series is portrayed as a good thing, the followup comics show that implementing that democracy in practice is hard work. The second series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLegendOfKorraRuinsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLegendOfKorraRuinsOfTheEmpire">The Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire</a></em> has Korra go to the Earth Kingdom to help them with their fledging democracy. It's estimated that it will take a full year before they can have elections and the Earth Kingdom has never been democratic so it's hard to get others on board. The confusion is also used as a means to an end by Guan, the villain.

<ul><li> It's not an uncommon theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> fanfics to use this trope, seeing as how Celestia is supposed to be a good queen (well, princess) but viewers tend to associate democracy with the "good" form of government. In some politically focused stories, Princess Celestia and/or Luna exhibits this attitude to explain why Equestria remains under an eternal monarchy/diarchy.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EquestriaAHistoryRevealed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EquestriaAHistoryRevealed">Equestria: A History Revealed</a>,</em> while it started off promising, the Equinus Republic quickly devolved into politicians holding their own private agendas, constant lack of consensus and progress, and pointless bickering in Parliament. This all sets the stage for the rise of Discord.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SunshineAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SunshineAndFire">Sunshine and Fire</a></em>, Celestia uses this logic to argue against the parallel universe version of Applejack and her plan to overthrow her own world's version of Celestia (a corrupt, insane tyrant) and install democracy in her place. She specifically focuses on how, in addition to democracy's normal flaws (aka susceptibility to inefficiency, corruption, infighting and mob justice), Applejack wants to install it on a world that has known nothing but tyranny and oppression for a thousand years, and in particular where "the majority" will be drawn from a species that was repressed for those thousand years and which would thusly be eager to oppress those who had power beforehand in turn.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheEquestrianCivilServiceSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheEquestrianCivilServiceSeries">The Equestrian Civil Service Series</a> splits the difference by making Equestria a <em>constitutional</em> monarchy (or possibly diarchy) that's very similar to the real-life Westminster system, which isn't surprising for a series that owes so much inspiration to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhiteSheepRWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhiteSheepRWBY">White Sheep (RWBY)</a></em>: General Ironwood has many problems with the Atlas Council, and Jaune finds it impossible to get them to capitulate to his extremely minor, perfectly reasonable demands. Despite Ironwood's complaints, he is quick to insist that democracy is far better than the alternative. The big problem is that Jaune has basically forced them into the worst possible situation for a democratic council: Making a snap decision, with minimal information, and what information they do have runs counter to everything the people have believed for centuries. Due to the myth of Atlas' invincibility, if the politicians give Jaune what he wants they will all immediately be impeached and the country will be thrown into chaos. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jaune and Ironwood reach a compromise by faking a war, which puts the country under martial law and leaves Ironwood as the sole person with any authority. The plan is to fight for a few weeks and then "force" Jaune to "accept" peace, ignoring the fact that this is what he wanted all along</span>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: In the prequel trilogy, then-Senator Palpatine uses the political mire of the Galactic Senate to ignite his scheme of overthrowing the Jedi and Senate to establish a Sith Empire. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">the Expanded Universe</a>, it's implied that a large amount of the corruption in the Senate for the millenium was due to the Sith. All Palpatine did was fulfill it.
<ul><li> This is a running theme through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>. No one's debating the Republic doesn't have many, <em>many</em> flaws. However, they stood for almost <em>thirty thousand years</em> against many iterations of the Sith Empire. The Empire in all but the most recent form (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsLegacy">that is, under the rule of the Fel family</a>) is a brutal, racist, sexist, corrupt and self-destructive trash heap with crumbling or non-existent infrastructure, a house of cards economy built on eternal war and slave labor, wastes the talents of <em>most</em> species (remember: this is a galaxy with at least <em>twenty million</em> sentient species) by making sure anyone who isn't Human (or Sith species, when they were still around) is sent to a slave pit (if they're not Force Sensitive). Force Sensitives are conscripted to the Sith to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">trained</a>, target practice, and frequently both. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> is standard operating procedure, as is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a> (no one can <em>trust</em> their underlings, as the underlings are just biding their time to stab the boss and take their job and the underlings can't trust the boss not to get them killed just to advance their prospects), and the whole thing is "ruled" by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> theocratic cabal of Sith who don't give a bantha's arse about anything but their own (inevitably lethal) power games. The Republic looks like <em>Utopia</em> compared to that mess.
</li><li> One of the most overwhelming themes of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em> series. Pretty much every problem is caused by the Galactic Federation, and pretty much every one of those is because it's a democracy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sunshine">Sunshine</a></em>. When the Icarus II crew is discussing the option of diverting the mission to intercept the Icarus I so they can retrieve the payload and possibly save their crew if they are still alive, Mace wants to put it up to a vote. Searle points out that they are not a democracy, but a group of astronauts and scientists on a mission to save mankind. Therefore they shouldn't arbitrarily make their decision by popular concensus but to make the most informed decision possible, made by the person best qualified to understand the theory and complexities of the payload delivery, physicist Capa.

<ul><li> This was a key theme of the late Allen Drury's <em>Advise and Consent</em> series (written between the late 1950's and the mid-1970's). He sought to show, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a>, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">American democracy, as inefficient as it often is, is infinitely preferable to the "efficient" tyranny of Communist regimes.</a>

Given the general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a> <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons">Morons</a> tendencies on the Disc, the only viable forms of government are monarchies and dictatorships.
<ul><li> The Ephebians have an elected head of state (elected by a very small minority of rich men, that is) but as it's a parody of Athens' own democracy in ancient times, it's hardly a democracy as we'd understand it: the head of state has the <em>official</em> title of "Tyrant" and doesn't appear to have any checks on his powers other than a fixed term in office.

Vimes could see the flaw there straight away.</em>
</div></li><li> King Verence II of the Lancre is a well-meaning fellow that attempted to implement a parliament. His subjects however, clearly have no interest in doing what they think is his job for him. Ironically, this (along with other implications) clearly implies the populace already have some sense of self-determination.
</li><li> After the last king of Ankh-Morpork, Lorenzo the Kind, was killed by "Stoneface" Vimes, democracy was established in the city. The people immediately voted against it, as they didn't want to be ruled by idiots like their neighbors.

In the books they make it more explicit that <em>any</em> ship captain can put themselves forward as a candidate  it's just that the main families like the Greyjoys tend to be the most famous and successful, so they usually win. In turn, this means they will probably continue to have opportunities to be successful, so power does tend to be concentrated in a few families (they only tend to get voted out of power if they really screw up). In the book version, three other minor fringe candidates try to run against Yara and Euron but they don't even make it through the first round of voting and quickly give up. Democracy is Flawed also applies in the sense that the ship captains voting at the Kingsmoot tend to be easily swayed by grandstanding and empty promises  in the books, it was considered unusual that a few of the smarter lords actually support Yara, based on her appeal to <em>reason and logic</em> ("What the hell do you think will happen if we keep harassing the mainlanders?")

The first Autobahn (or, Autostrada in the native language) in the world was proposed in 1921 and completed in 1924-1925 in Italy, Mussolini having gained power in 1922.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qxty');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qxty" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qxty');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is <em>one</em> instance where the Mussolini claim was proven true. When the King of Italy surrendered power to the Black Shirts and decided to make Mussolini the prime minister, Mussolini immediately got on a semi-private train at his home (what, you didn't think he was actually leading the army in person, did you?) and demanded that he make it to Rome immediately in order to be there for the transference of power. Which the train managed to do, in almost record time. So we can say that, in the case where it's a personal demand by the dictator itself, the trains can be made to run on time once.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the new German state simply kept most of the existing laws but made significant changes in regard to elections and the power of major offices in the new constitution, to prevent the rise of populists in the future. While many aspects of national and state election and lawmaking are now frequently described as undemocratic, it was regarded as a necessary move. In late 2011, the Pirate Party unexpectedly came in fifth in the Berlin state election and fourth in the Saarland, winning seats in both states and are expected to get similar results in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. While rightfully described as a populist movement, the Pirate Party of Germany differs from other such parties in Europe by having the increase of democratic participation in Germany as their primary (and some even say only) aim, instead of handing all power to strong leaders who know "what's best" for the country.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> did much to popularize this image and it gave an image of "democracy" as amounting to mob rule orchestrating several large amounts of deaths. Researchers who know the actual history see the Revolution's failures as stemming not from mob rule but poor leadership made by the "leaders" who made things worse by declaring war on the rest of Europe. The third view these days is the democracy of the First French Republic was bad, self-destructive and transient but given the circumstances it operated under, achieved a lot more than it had any right to expect or hope for and that, despite reversals, it codified modern democracy (anti-racism, abolition of slavery, people's right to protest, universal suffrage) and through its military successes, it proved that democracy could rule a large nation and lead it to war and it generated massive shock waves that forced nations across Europe to reform or go the way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXVI">Louis XVI</a>.
</li><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech:
<div class="indent">"Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BerlinWall">a wall</a> up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us."
</div><ul><li> And then there's good old first-past-the-post, which operates roughly thus: if there are three large and a multitude of small parties and Party A gets 34% of the vote, Party B gets 33% and the remaining 33% goes to Parties C through K, Party A gets to make all the decisions by itself until the next election, unless Party B or C can herd together enough allies in the smaller parties to form 34% or more of the vote between them. Constitutional monarchies usually give the sovereign the casting vote in this eventuality; the decision-making process elsewhere varies. Either way, the 66% of the population who <em>didn't</em> vote for the people now running the show are kind of screwed.
</li><li> Which is why, by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law">Duverger's law,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> democracies whose elections are determined by first-past-the-post tend towards two-party systems (the United States being the prime example): groups of like-minded voters tend to congregate together into broad coalitions in order to reach that 50%+1 threshold that would guarantee victory. Note that this is not a hard-and-fast rule - countries with parties having strong regionalist platforms tend to break this rule (e.g., the US in the 1860 presidential election, Canada and the UK today).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mfg0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mfg0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mfg0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This effect is partly because first-past-the-post tends to be abandoned when a genuine multi-party system emerges.</span>
</li><li> Canada and the UK have what is sometimes called a two-and-a-half party system. That is, there are two dominant parties that regularly win most or all of the elections, but one or more smaller parties also regularly win a significant number of seats. These parties sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario">hold the balance of power</a> when neither of the two largest parties has a majority.
</li><li> To avoid this, some countries opt for a proportional representation system, but this has flaws of its own. Chiefly, small parties are given disproportionate power, since as it's very difficult for any party to get a majority they need their support to form coalitions. This means that small parties that don't represent most citizens' opinions can have a major hand in government decisions, and even control over certain ministries as inducement to support the ruling coalition.
</li></ul></li><li> When there are only two physical choices for a given vote (i.e., "yes" or "no"), simple majority vote generally works fine. But by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow's impossibility theorem,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when there are three or more possible options which each voter personally ranks in order, it's impossible to have a voting system that can convey the sum of each voter's ranking of choices into a "fair" community-wide ranking. Any voting system you design will violate at least one of the following aspects of fairness:
<ul><li> No one voter gets to pick the whole electorate's preferences without input from others ("Non-dictatorship").
</li><li> If every voter individually prefers option A over option B, then the election will always pick A over B ("Monotonicity").
</li><li> If every voter previously preferred option X over option Y, then the election will always put X over Y whether or not Z is a pickable choice. ("Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives").
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> once commented—jokingly, one sincerely hopes!—that his job would be easier if he were a dictator. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">Conspiracy Theories</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">LBJ</a> also made a statement on what he would do if he were a dictator, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> also made a comment about dictatorships being more efficient than democracy, as noted above. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> said, "I've got a pen and I've got a phone - and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward." and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> celebrated Chinese President Xi Jinping abolishing term limits, adding "Maybe we'll give that a shot". In fact, most democratically elected leaders have most likely fantasized that they were dictators at one point or another, if only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">cut through all of the red tape.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth">Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a> that represented a "nation of nobles" where each noble was equal, and had voting powers and deliberative powers in the quasi-parliament, the General Sejm, with each noble having Liberum Veto to unilaterally cancel any policy it dislikes so any decision passed must have a total consensus. This was supposed to act as a check on the power of the King/Grand Duke: if he wanted a law passed, he needed the consent of the Sejm, who would grant or withhold approval through simple majority vote. However, this handicapped the King from having any executive power. If the King wanted to make reforms for the general benefit of the entire realm, he would face backlash from those nobles who perceived that said development would take away influence and importance away from it. This effectively paralyzed the realm. Moreover this system allowed neighboring powers to easily bribe one or two of the nobles. This allowed Russia, Austria and Prussia to start messing in the nation's internal affairs. Likewise, while the Commonwealth and its Sejm had a bigger franchise than UK's Parliament and had 300 members, but on the other hand it was a system coterminous with serfdom, which comprised 80% of the population who had zero rights and no representation. Enlightenment thinkers such as Rousseau and in America, Franklin and Madison, cited the Commonwealth circa 1700s as a system that was both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">feudal ''and'' republican</a> possessing none of the advantages of either system and the flaws of both, citing the Liberum Veto and foreign influence as part of the justification for a strong executive in America as well as the Emoluments Cause.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a> puts a high emphasis on how much they love democracy. When it was revealed that Suharto's reign was in fact a facade of dictatorship, and a few incidents proved this, they were pissed, removed Suharto from power, and strove to be as democratic as possible. Happy ending? Nope. Turns out that even the democratic parties were also flawed, Indonesia's advancement has been kind of stagnant and it allows several annoying factions like the Islamic Defenders Front to be very open in how much they think Indonesia should just take the method of Taliban Islam and causing general ruckus everywhere "in the name of God". It says something that despite Suharto's dictatorship and fake propaganda, some people agreed that he did a lot more for Indonesia's advances, to the point of wanting a new Suharto-like leader to rise, just without his questionable traits.
</li><li> The Electoral College system in the United States was designed to serve as a check against Democracy. The founders did not want one region to dominate by virtue of most people live there, so they didn't want to use a pure popular vote. The TL;DR version is that the President is determined by winning more smaller, regional popular votes, than the other candidate. Usually, this falls in line with the popular vote, but in 5 occasions, there was a difference between the two numbers. There are theoretical situations where one can become president while winning only 23% of the popular vote. This requires some numbers that are so precise (not to mention a political alliance of several states that traditionally would be laughable) that it's safe to say it could never happen. That said, Nixon was elected by carrying 49 out of 50 states. Nixon himself was the president who got the closest to outright doing away with the Electoral College. His administration worked with Congress to propose a constitutional amendment that passed the House with an overwhelming bipartisan majority (339-70) in 1969 but died in the senate. They were about a dozen votes short of getting to the 67 they needed and most of the holdouts were southern segregationist Democrats.
<dl><dd><ul><li> To scare you even more, that 23% assumes only two candidates. You only need to win the 11 most populous states by 1 vote each, and win by a plurality, not a majority. If you have three or more serious candidates (think 1992 with Clinton, Bush Sr, and Perot), you can do it with even less than 23% in theory.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> It's also worth pointing out that the system originally did not have any popular vote requirement. Instead the members of the Electoral were selected in a manner chosen by the State Legislature and as such were only indirectly elected.
</li><li> While the Electoral College was designed to prevent a few small regions with the highest populations from dominating the vote on a federal scale, the idea of one small region eclipsing a lot of less densely populated regions is still an issue on a state-wide scale, as most states determine their votes for the Electoral College on a winner-takes-all basis. This means that any city or region that holds most of the state's population (one example being Chicago for Illinois) can effectively dominate their state's vote even if the rest of the state voted differently than that city, and the less populated parts of the state can be effectively ignored from campaign groups.
</li><li> The Electoral College was also designed partially under the idea of there being two candidates, but did not anticipate only two broad political <em>parties</em>. The modern Democrat and Republican parties were founded long after the Constitution was written, and efforts to get a third party (or more) has met with limited success, with only Libertarians getting ANY foothold. In contrast, other countries may have multiple parties but they still tend to whittle it down to a couple of candidates for the deciding vote. If there are five parties candidates may squeak by with 21 percent of an initial voting period to become one of the final two, but the deciding vote is being made by a country that just doesn't like any of the options because their preferred candidate was knocked out of the race.
</li><li> A feature of the electoral college that comes from its nature is that it partially obscures or makes irrelevant local differences in turnout or voting eligible population. The number of electors is (indirectly) based on population via being based on each state's congressional delegation (with minimum number of electors per state being 3, thus slightly distorting the weight of small states upward), however, it is <em>not</em> based on voting eligible or actually voting population. So during slavery three fifths of slaves were counted, during Jim Crowe blacks who could not hope to ever get to vote were counted and during the whole era of no female suffrage, women were counted. It is certain that had slaves not been counted in 1800 and had the election gone exactly the same, Jefferson (the Southern candidate) would have lost and Adams (the Northern candidate) would have won. The repercussions down the ages can only be guessed at, but in a system where the national popular vote counts, a state has an advantage in enfranchising more of its people (e.g. giving women full suffrage) in an electoral college system it will not benefit from that. There is however an - arguably - positive aspect to this feature, as local events that depress or increase turnout have no outsize effect. If a blizzard immobilizes large parts of Alaska and only a few hundred Alaskans vote, Alaska still gets three electoral votes, if the presidential candidate is from Wyoming and thus every Wyomingite goes voting, the state will still only get three electoral votes. In a national popular vote events like these can (and do) influence national electoral results, to the point that a sunny day in parts of the country that traditionally vote for one party can swing the election in a close race.
</li><li> There is a loophole which would effectively render the Electoral College completely pointless without having to get rid of it. Currently, most states give all their votes to the candidate who won a plurality in the state, with Nebraska and Maine choosing their electors semi-proportionally. However, this does not have to be the case. The Constitution provides that each state can appoint its electors "in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct", meaning that the state legislatures can choose any method they want to select their electors. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact">The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a growing movement which could take advantage of this technicality to effectively bypass the Electoral College. Once enough states join to control a majority of the electoral votes (270/538), they would all give their votes to the candidate who won the <em>national</em> popular vote, forcing a victory for that candidate regardless of population distribution.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Senate has also become increasingly undemocratic in a different way than it was originally. Back in the day, the senate was undemocratic because it was not elected by popular vote but appointed by governors because it was seen as a more highbrow chamber than the House which was elected by the commoners. This function was done away with starting in the 1918 elections. It is now undemocratic because while more people live in the roughly dozen most populated states, there are more sparsely populated states. Back when the constitution was first written the biggest state had 12x the population of the smallest state while today it's 68x. The 51 senators in the majority in 2018 represented only 44% of the country's population. The problem is only getting worse too. A study by the University of Virginia estimated that by 2040 70% of Americans will live in the fifteen biggest states meaning that 30% of Americans will have 70% of the senators while 70% has 30% of the senators. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/28/by-2040-two-thirds-of-americans-will-be-represented-by-30-percent-of-the-senate/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d6fc511ca880">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. At the current moment, the make up of the Senate hurts the Democrats but prior to about 2000, it hurt Republicans. This is largely due to the very heavily democratic GI generation having mostly died off and being replaced in the electorate by their more conservative children, the baby boomer generation. Millennials who are Democrats like the GIs are/were cluster into bigger states in the Sunbelt like California, Georgia, and Texas which dilutes their votes in the senate.
