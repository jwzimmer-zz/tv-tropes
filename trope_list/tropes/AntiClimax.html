<div class="indent">— A complete comic strip from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/CyanideAndHappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/CyanideAndHappiness">Cyanide &amp; Happiness</a></em>
</div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClimax">The Climax</a> is one of the oldest devices in storytelling. For those who don't know, the climax is when the story reaches its head, when the most important or exciting part occurs; in an action film, the climax is almost always a large, spectacular fight.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>As a result, the <em>subversion</em> of the climax, the Anticlimax, is probably almost as old. The anticlimax is when you're set up for a climax, such as a spectacular, battle-to-end-all-battles between the hero and the villain. It's built up more and more until the suspense is extremely exciting, and the reader/viewer can't wait for it...then the hero kills the villain in one hit, or the villain spontaneously drops dead, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">some other random guy shows up</a> and destroys the villain before the hero does anything. Thus is the anticlimax. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a> almost always features an anticlimax. Interestingly, however, cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Shoot the Shaggy Dog</a> usually <em>do</em> have a climax.
</p><p>Not all anticlimaxes are intentional, though. Oftentimes, they are caused when the story writes itself into a corner. Other times, it's caused when the writer realizes that their planned solution just wouldn't make sense compared with the logical one. Sometimes, it's caused when there are teams of writers that don't communicate very well. The planned resolution of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> is nullified by another writer, who might have written out the plot device intended. Sometimes, in the case of film and television, it's caused by budget constraints or unexpected cancellation. It's rather rare for unintentional anticlimaxes to show up in single works, usually popping up in long serials where there isn't a chance to unobtrusively go back and rewrite some pivotal moments to set up the proper climax.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Anticlimaxes can work well if it's clear that the subversion of audience expectations is the point, either for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">humorous purposes</a> (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxCut">Anti-Climax Cut</a>) or as a more serious commentary on the genre of the work. If the anticlimax is unintentional, however, or if the author's purpose just isn't sufficiently clear to the audience, the result is serious audience frustration. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Use caution</a>.

A story with an anticlimax will train a pilot, build his jet, fuel his jet, prepare the runway, prepare the radio tower, prime the jet to launch, then cancel the launch as the pilot reads a book in the cockpit. A story with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> will train the pilot, build the jet, fuel the jet, prepare the runway, prepare the radio tower, prime the jet to launch, then take the jet to its destination via the talons of a giant eagle. An anticlimax is a climax that isn't: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> is a climax that comes from nowhere.

<ul><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em> ends with the player-character heroes facing up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>-type monster, and it looks as if there's going to be a big climactic fight scene. Instead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the uber-hacker Helba just switches off the server and deletes the game</span>. There was a real world ending that kinda makes up for it, though. The whole thing was a lead-up/prologue for the <em>.hack</em> games from one person's perspective (that person being Tsukasa). Considering the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Skeith, the monster, can't be defeated without subverting the physics of the game world with Data Drain</span>, it would have been even <em>more</em> anticlimactic and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> for everyone to die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">plays ping pong with this one</a> during the Negi/Rakan fight, which starts off with an apparent anticlimax (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Negi K.O.ing Rakan</span>), before having 3 or 4 climactic moments, only to keep going. Ultimately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Negi's final massive attack fails to knock Rakan out, but drains him enough that they resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> before fainting from exhaustion in a tie</span>. Whether this is an actual Anti-Climax, a subversion thereof, or some kind of combination is up for debate.

</li><li> After being filled with all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">cool</a>, awesome fights, the final battle of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em> movie between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a>, built up over about two hours, lasted literally all of five seconds.
</li><li> There's a decent amount of complaints that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> anime's final battle between Chrono and Aion is much, much too short, particularly after all the build up. The fact that the ending is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> in the end probably doesn't help. (Parodied amusingly in <a class="urllink" href="http://comixqueen.deviantart.com/art/Smack-40976001?offset=25#comments">this fanart.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MariaHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MariaHolic">MariaHolic</a></em> ends almost every episode by introducing some dangerous situation or even a monster, only to have it resolved within the first two minutes of the next episode and never mentioned again.
</li><li> This happens pretty frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, especially toward the end of arcs. Kubo will normally set up a lot of battles to give whatever of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> are still standing something to do. Once the final battle is over, the resolution of the fights set up during this time oftentimes taking place off screen, some of them even going so far as to not even reveal who won.
<ul><li> At the end of the Arrancar arc, Yammy becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> and demolishes Rukia, Renji, and Chad (in the manga, off-panel no less) and tanks everything Ichigo can throw at him and more. Once Kenpachi and Byakuya take over, they treat him as a joke and spend half the fight focusing on each other. Even after he transforms again into something even bigger, the end of the arc reveals that they simply killed him off screen.
</li><li> 3rd Espada Tia Harribel is about to take on Hiyori, Lisa, and Hitsugaya at the same time. Before we see a single exchange of blows as the two Vizards prepare to fight seriously for the first time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Aizen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">attacks Harribel for no reason</a></span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tousen</span> reveals his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form, only to get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabbed in the head and killed by his ex-lieutenant</span>.
</li><li> The final episode of the anime ended with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lost Substitute Shinigami</span> arc, where the final battles were very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">one-sided</a> in favor of the Soul Reapers, more so than any other arc so far (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kenpachi's</span> battle against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Giriko Kutsuzawa</span> is quite possibly the shortest "fight" in the series' history). Ichigo didn't even have a hard time defeating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kugo Ginjo</a></span>. What a way for the anime to end. The Bleach fans who don't bother with the manga and watch the anime exclusively must be pissed.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first half, Aizen, is built up to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">unstoppable</a>, defeating the entire supporting cast with one blow on average. After the main character trains for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">three months/an hour</a> (consisting mostly of him being stabbed) the enemy who has been hyped up throughout the entire series is defeated in three chapters with absolutely no effort on the part of Ichigo.
</li><li> Even worse than The Espada was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ginjo</span>. After all the buildup after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> about him being both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc and his talk of his strength, Ichigo proceeds to fight him for one chapter in bankai before one-shotting him.
</li><li> Due to the manga's early cancellation, the final fight with Yhwach goes shorter than it was likely originally intended. The last leg of it in Soul Society takes only a few chapters, ending with a last-minute power-up from Uryu turning his powers against him and giving Ichigo a chance to cut him down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>: epic use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">William Tell Overture</a> heralds what is an Anti-Climax for the titular character: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having been given command of the entire UPSF fleet, Tylor gives one order: advance.

When he finally makes his first present-day appearance, he's just shown talking with the fellow members of the Zodiac with no build-up or fanfare whatsoever. Even better, the Zodiac itself gets a <em>huge</em> build-up, culminating in a two-page spread of them walking towards Hunter HQ. Except that they're all facing away from the reader, so it's impossible to tell that one of them is Ging.

Justified by two factors: first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the crew just came from two years of intense training in order to face the New World,</span> and second, he basically was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> without much experience.
</li><li> Bellamy, whose only justification is the latter reason. He got beat by Luffy with <em><strong>one punch</strong></em>, long before any of the Straw Hats got <em>really</em> strong.
</li><li> The next villain after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hody Jones</span> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Caesar Clown, a sadistic scientist who ate the Gas-Gas Fruit</span> who is taken down easily by Luffy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who now has the ability to touch Logia in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke">Super Smoke</a> forms</span>. Justified in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that the Logia he had fought previously were much stronger than this one for two reasons, one they were some of the strongest characters in the series, and two they had back-ups to when their abilities are cancelled, while Caesar completely relies on his</span>. So it is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caesar may have been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc, but to be quite honest, of the three main villains of the arc (him, Monet, and Vergo), it became clear that he was the <em>weakest</em> of them. Monet, asides from being a snow logia (meaning she has weaker and more smoke-like powers of Aokiji's), also used some icepicks as weapons, yet even she was somewhat of an Anti-Climax Boss, being taken down by Zoro by just <em>fear</em>, and then finished off by Tashigi. Vergo however was the only subversion during this arc — he was not only the most dangerous, he was also the most effective — he had Law's heart, allowing him take out one of the five people who could possibly beat him that were on the island (Smoker, Law, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji). Sanji had tremendous difficulty with him and soon got distracted by Tashigi and the Marines of G-5, Law couldn't beat him until he regained his heart, and since neither Luffy nor Zoro had any personable desire to face him as they were too busy with the other two, that just left Smoker to take him on.</span>
</li><li> The Zou arc features this in a way that manages to be both anticlimactic <em>and</em> epic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack the Drought, one of Emperor Kaido's top men, with the highest bounty revealed to that point in the series (one billion Berries), shown to be an incredibly powerful and insanely ruthless warrior that fought for days without slowing down, with a fleet of ships and monsters under his command... gets taken out in one shot. How is that epic? Because the one who does it is Zunisha, an elephant several miles tall, to protect the citizens who dwell in the city on his back, just with a single sweep of its trunk that took out the entire rest of the fleet as collateral damage. Ending an entire threat in a literal minute is rather an anticlimax, but when it's a nation-sized creature doing so it's still quite amazing</span>.

But we're four episodes from the end, and all the other times were just warmups. It's time to see his real Deck... and it's a gamble deck. A gamble deck that takes up his entire Spell and Trap zone. Then he proceeds to give Judai everything he needs to bring out the superpowered Neos Wiseman. Then he finally brings out his ace, Darkness Neosphere... but before he can even use its effect, Judai copies it with Black Panther and proceeds to use it on him and ruin his entire strategy. All told, the progenitor of the World of Darkness goes down in one and a half episodes.

When he finally duels Kaito (supposedly his apprentice), he brings out the largest monster in the entire series, Dyson Sphere... and that's basically it. He uses no complex tactics or intelligent plays; he just sits on Dyson Sphere and uses it to tank Kaito's first few attacks. When Kaito proceeds to pull out Neo Galaxy-Eyes, which V knew he had and had seen him use to defeat the other two Arclights, he had absolutely nothing to counter it.

He showed up (flashbacks aside) for less than a dozen chapters, did pretty much nothing but oneshotting Negi and Fate and immobilizing Ala Rubra, literally did nothing else as Class 3-A freed Asuna, on whom his plans hinged, and then he was vanquished away by Negi and Asuna in a single chapter.

</li><li> An issue commonly cited about the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> comic was how easily Mega Man took down each of the first six Robot Masters, wiping them out in two issues with relative ease, making Mega Man look like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a>.

First, the attack on Lord Kira's estate and the ronin murdering Lord Kira takes place about 3/4 of the way through. Second, the attack is not even shown, being instead recounted after the fact in a letter. Third, as noted above, the film meanders for nearly an hour after the killing of Lord Kira. The ronin bring Kira's head to Asano's grave. They wait around for a while at another lord's house. After getting flowers from Lady Asano that are a signal that they will be forced to commit harakiri, the ronin proceed toput on a variety show. (One of them dances). There's a subplot in which Mino, a character who is neither seen nor mentioned until the last half-hour of the movie, sneaks into the compound to find out if the ronin that romanced her really loved her.

The horns are sounded, the horses charge, lances are leveled... and Guilbert drops dead of a heart attack. Of course, in the book it's a thinly disguised metaphor for his guilty conscience at all the evil things he's done overcoming him—he would have obliterated Ivanhoe, dooming Rebecca to an unjust death.

</li><li> Despite being one of the more memorable seasons overall, Season 17 had an Anti-Climax over the last few episodes. Nick and Vicki wound up so far behind due to a six hour penalty that there was pretty much no suspense that the final three would be anybody <em>but</em> Brook &amp; Claire, Jill &amp; Thomas, and Nat &amp; Kat. Then in the final leg, Jill &amp; Thomas get lost halfway through the episode, while Nat &amp; Kat so thoroughly dominate the final leg, it became pretty obvious that they were the season's winners.
</li><li> They suffered from this in the last episode of Season 19. Of the three teams who arrived in Atlanta on the same flight, third-place Amani and Marcus effectively eliminated themselves immediately by taking far too long on the first task. Jeremy and Sandy suffered from a miscommunication with a local who inadvertently directed them to the suburbs instead of the correct destination downtown. As a result winners Ernie and Cindy had an enormous lead by the midpoint of the episode, completing the last task and leaving for the Finish Line before Jeremy and Sandy even arrived to start the last task. This robbed the finish of all suspense.

In every case leading up to the finale, the writers either ended the interaction between Sylar and Peter suddenly (during their second altercation, Peter is stabbed in the head after a few seconds) or takes place <em>offscreen</em> (as seen in "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HeroesS01E20FiveYearsGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HeroesS01E20FiveYearsGone">Five Years Gone</a>").

Everyone took turns whaling on Sylar (including Nikki/Jessica, who beats on Sylar with <em>a parking meter</em>). The fight ends with Hiro teleporting in, with his sword <em>stuck out in front of him</em>, landing the final blow. Sylar and Peter had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers">complete assortment of powers at their disposal</a>, and never used them.

After various twists, Lucifer and Chloe discover the author had decided that, instead of an epic huge battle with multiple deaths, she wanted a "grounded, peaceful ending of people finally understanding one another." Her editor was utterly horrified that this wasn't the wild finale he'd been promised and "boring." He's convinced that the book would bomb and readers hate it and when she refused to use the "good" version a fanfic writer submitted, he killed her. He even defends destroying the manuscript as "no one could read that pathetic joke of an ending!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Megaforce</a></em> ends with the hilariously short legend war, and after it's over, no epilogue. The rangers run off in the distance. And unlike the other Neo-Saban seasons, there is no follow-up holiday special. We never see anyone besides Gia again.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS2E6Twisted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS2E6Twisted">Twisted</a>", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> that is warping the ship and everything and on it (and incapacitating the crew) is really a bunch of aliens trying to say "hello." And there is no harm done and no reference to these events ever again.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS06E06SacrificeOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS06E06SacrificeOfAngels">Sacrifice of Angels</a>", the heroes have been defeated and a fleet of enemy warships is about to come through a wormhole. Sisko appeals to a group of godlike beings who inhabit the wormhole, and the enemy ships mysteriously vanish. The end of the war is one too. The fighting is bitter, the Dominion refuse to admit defeat...and then Odo comes down, performs a "link" with the female founder, and boom, the war is over.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS04E21TheseAreTheVoyages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS04E21TheseAreTheVoyages">finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, a series which had been building towards the founding of the Federation throughout its run, is really just a Holodeck program being run by Riker in-between scenes of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E11ThePegasus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E11ThePegasus">The Pegasus</a>" and splits its focus between Riker's conflict in that episode and a relatively minor sub-plot in the <em>Enterprise</em> timeframe. Viewers never even get to see the legendary speech that Archer gave which was played up by the characters. Made worse by the fact that this was the <em>the</em> last episode of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> television series for the foreseeable future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em> often has anticlimactic endings to episodes, and in many ways the final episode itself was. Many villains are built up to be very sinister and frightening, only to be beaten with a punch or two. One villain was even defeated off screen, only referenced with a throw away line. The final episode tried to build up the villains' evil by having them kill off a few characters (only one of those characters was a main character, and it was a retcon anyway, as he had been dead for most of the season,) but the parallel story being told about Hayes Cooper not only made the main story quite short, the villains still didn't have anywhere near the setup many other recurring, multi-part episode, or even some one-time villains did. After the dream episode in which Trivette and Walker are killed before the cavalry arrives to presumably end the threat, a biker gang isn't very epic for a final episode.

</li><li> <em>One World</em> - About the time Toryzan is voted out, you can pretty much guess that Kim's going to win.

</li><li> There is lots of build-up over the enigmatic Anointed One, Collin, his mysterious powers and his role in Buffy's battle with the Master.

</li></ul></li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longmire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Longmire">Longmire</a></em> built up the fact that Walt would have to fight for reelection as sheriff against his younger, slicker and more political deputy Branch Connally.

We only find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Longmire</span> won when the other candidate is told that he forgot to give his concession speech. The election is barely mentioned after that as the real climax of the second season begins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Season 5 finale features the Titans getting released after years of imprisonment. They're able to turn Paige to stone, kill most of the Elders and Leo has to give the sisters powers of Greek Gods to stop them. They're easily beaten by Piper in one fight scene - and the last ten minutes of the episode instead focus on Piper having to deal with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leo becoming an Elder</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in "Charmed and Dangerous". The episode opens with a big battle with the Source of All Evil - <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the show. After trapping him in a crystal circle, he dies when one of his own fireballs is deflected onto him.

<ul><li> After Darkseid was being built up for all of the final season as the ultimate unstoppable personification of evil, he goes down fairly quickly. His Unholy Trinity (Godfrey, Desaad, Granny Goodness) also go down easily to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Green Arrow, from one arrow each</span>.
</li><li> Doomsday from Season Eight, though at least his encounter with Clark can legitimately be called a "fight." Once again, after building up the tension in previous episodes that season, and constantly stressing how Clark could die, The battle was 3 or 4 minutes, mostly off screen and Clark was just fine afterwards. Having arguably the two most powerful Superman villains taken down so quickly is part of why the later seasons aren't looked upon so well.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em> had Margos Dezerian, a ruthless assassin for the Armenian mob sent to wipe out the Strike Team, who after being built up as a ruthless psychopathic badass is dispatched rather easily at point blank range in a hallway by Vic Mackey.

What happened? Well she woke up just fine in the Upside-Down shortly after her apparent death, walked down the hall, and found a portal back. Then she went through it. If she hadn't decided to stay away to avoid the government agents looking for her they'd have barely noticed she'd gone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a>:</em> At the end of season 5, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jon Snow was killed by his fellows at the Night's Watch,</span> as happens in the books. This caused a media sensation, with everyone wondering whether he was really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, as in the book it's implied that he will remain alive, but that particular cliffhanger hasn't been resolved yet. If he was killed and brought back to life, that would be truly incredible - there is precedent, but only in very specific circumstances. Early in season 6, it appears he really is dead. But two characters (neither of whom have ever shown any real interest in him so far) are suddenly convinced that this can't hold, and so they revive him! By <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chanting a few words and making a few hand movements</span>. Okay, but at least there <em>is</em> a precedent for magic in this series, sure. But how will this character - how will <em>any of the characters</em> react to someone being brought back from the dead? Well... the character himself just kind of shrugs it off, showing little more than bemusement. As a result he decides this means <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's technically not bound to the Night's Watch anymore, which is really taking the literal meaning of the rules rather than the spirit, and undoing years of character development that his duties there were vitally important in the process</span>, the other characters decide not to tell anyone, and that's it. Aside from getting a cliffhanger out of it, it might as well have never happened. In season 7, at least, there is some implication that the characters are keeping it a secret, but there's no real reason why they should - if anything, such an incredible feat should <em>help</em> him convince people he's doing the right thing. In all, despite being built up as a massive and shocking twist, it barely affected the plot at all.
<ul><li> In an earlier season, Yara learns that her brother is being tortured by Ramsay, and sets off at the end of the season, set to stirring music, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRescue">to bring a fleet to come to his rescue.</a> Come the next season, her 'fleet' arrives (now just one small boat), and they attack Ramsay's castle. But far from hardened Ironborn warriors, they barely manage to even hold their own against the castle's dogs - and then, comedically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Ramsay</a> comes out not just without armor, <em>but entirely bare-chested</em>, and somehow still manages to fight them off. Yara manages to make her way to Theon, but he's too brainwashed and traumatised to follow her willingly. So, she... just gives up and they all go home. Far from the daring rescue implied previously.

The final mission (where you have to reclaim Project Purity) starts with a glorified escort mission, where you stay behind a giant robot as it guns down Enclave soldiers outside the Jefferson Memorial. The game then becomes a joke, as you find yourself facing a final boss (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colonel Autumn</span>) who can either be put down in just a couple of hits, or persuaded (if your speech skills are high enough) to stop what he's doing.

Despite the fact that you have multiple companions immune to radiation, you can't use them (one explains that it's "your destiny") unless you have the Broken Steel DLC.

</li><li> The manga adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> pulls this full force at the end of the run. In the game's penultimate level, you fight Riku, Maleficent, Dragon!Maleficent, and Ansem!Riku, then you move on to the final level and fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Ansem, Darkside, Ansem again, then Ansem aboard his battleship</a>. The manga adaptation of the game has absolutely <em>none</em> of these fights: Riku runs from the first fight, then he kills Maleficent himself, the possessed Riku then <em>hands</em> Sora the dark Keyblade so Sora can release his heart, and once they track down Ansem, he gives his speech, unveils his huge battleship, and is then destroyed by the light of Kingdom Hearts without Sora and friends doing a damn thing. The game had a total of <em>eight</em> boss fights in its final two levels and the manga skips all of them—so not only is the manga an anti-climax, it's a lot worse for anyone who played the game first and was expecting some epic fight scenes. This is a problem with the manga in general. If boss battles appear at all, they tend to be really lame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">Single Stroke Battles</a>.

Then Kasumimaru will show up and interrupt them before a real victor is decided. Presumably, this is to keep the player from knowing who is the better fighter (and thus being persuaded by it). Additionally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the story is only confronted and defeated in the Good endings; in most of the Bad and Forgotten Dream endings, he's still at large at the end, although there is one instance in which he's simply captured and imprisoned offscreen.

As a result, some of their stories come to less climactic, faster resolutions than some of the dedicated readers expect. For example:
<ul><li> Amber mistook DiDi for Yuki, <em>and</em> was forming some kind of plot to save Gary from her. Then Gary showed up at her front door, so she just jumped him. Later, Zii simply corrected the DiDi-Yuki confusion in casual conversation.
</li><li> Yuki, Zii, and Sonya woke up naked in bed together. Zii jumped to the conclusion that they'd had sex (which many readers guessed would be wrong), then discovered that their clothes were missing, then found the clothes in the bathroom with a smell on them that made her think "Oh gawd!" Then it turned out that she was remembering that they'd jumped in a swimming pool fully dressed (so presumably the smell was chlorine), and the three of them had simply dozed off after hanging the clothes up to dry.

In the unabridged "Party of One", Pinkie Pie thinks all her friends have abandoned her, and she grows increasingly unhinged until she discovers that her friends were actually organizing a surprise birthday party for her. <em>That</em> is a satisfying conclusion. In "Stay Tuned!", Pinkie Pie is a police detective investigating Applejack's massive criminal empire, and she grows increasingly frazzled as it becomes clear that all of her friends are in on the conspiracy. When Pinkie storms into Applejack's barn and demands an explanation... she discovers that her friends were actually organizing a surprise birthday party for her. <em>That</em> is an anti-climax.

</li><li> The final broadcast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UPN">UPN</a> had no special advertising or last program specials and instead just faded to black after a broadcast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackdown">WWE Smackdown</a></em>.
<ul><li> Inversion: The network that UPN merged with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB">The WB</a>, to form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> had a whole special called <em>The Night of Favorites and Farewells</em> for the end of the network with pilots of their most popular programming with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneFroggyEvening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneFroggyEvening">Michigan J. Frog</a> even making an appearance despite being phased out of the network's branding in 2004. Due to issues with various former WB affiliates, the ratings for the special were <em>very</em> low and not many people saw it.
</li><li> Similarly, the final broadcast or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Vortexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Vortexx">Vortexx</a> on The CW was treated like a normal broadcast with no special advertising. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">sadder</a> when you realize it will probably be the last block to air non-educational <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon">Saturday Morning Cartoons</a> in a very long time, maybe forever.
</li></ul></li><li> Every doomsday prediction (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">so far</a>) has been met with this, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillenniumBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillenniumBug">Y2K</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayanDoomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayanDoomsday">21st of December 2012</a> being the biggest examples in recent history.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Three_Secrets_of_F%C3%A1tima">The Third Secret of Fátima<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is infamous for this. It was built up to be the most shocking vision in recorded history; so much that Pope John XXIII is supposed to have fainted and a few others (including, supposedly, John Paul I) reportedly <em>died</em> upon hearing it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5zqsa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5zqsa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5zqsa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">John XXIII, the first to open it, simply said "the world is not ready yet" and put it away. Subsequent popes did the same, and it's likely John Paul I never got around to reading it.</span> It was finally released to the eagerly waiting public in 2000; it turned out to be a set of surrealistic images that anybody could interpret however they liked. Even Joseph Ratzinger (who was to become Pope in 2005) admitted that it was pretty underwhelming considering all the hype.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p87r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p87r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p87r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pretty good, considering the 1984 interview in which he said he'd read it and it had to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEnd">The End</a>.</span>
</li><li> Nearly everyone expected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> to be impeached because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate">Watergate</a>. Instead, he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">resigned</a>.
</li><li> The infamous Geraldo Rivera hosted a live broadcast of the opening of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>'s vault: after hyping it up massively, claiming that it could contain everything from bodies to compromising photos, the safe turned out to contain... nothing.
</li><li> Comet ISON, after being hyped by the media as being the comet of the century that could be brighter than the full moon... just disintegrated near the sun and disappeared. Maybe somebody should have foreseen this, given that something similar had happened a generation earlier with Comet Kohoutek.
</li><li> The Silbury Hill digs of the late 1960s and early 70s hoped to discover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedTreasure">Buried Treasure</a> within a neolithic earthen mound in south west England. Turns out the mound was just a mound, and didn't contain anything except earth.
</li><li> For decades, everyone was sure that the Cold War would end in a nuclear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> breaking out between the United States and the Soviet Union, ending with either one wiping out the other or them mutually destroying each other (and probably taking the rest of the world with them). Instead, the Soviet Union ultimately dissolved (relatively) peacefully due to internal economic and political pressures, without a single shot fired at or by the West.
