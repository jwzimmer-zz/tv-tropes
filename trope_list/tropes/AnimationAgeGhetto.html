</p><p>There are many sociological theories as to how and why this trope originated, but one of the most common theories is that it's a by-product of the rise of animation on television in the '50s and '60s with many adults uninterested in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation">low quality</a> of many of these, and thus only kids being able to tolerate it, as well as television at the time being marketed as a way of keeping kids quiet and the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">parental groups</a> arguing for more government regulation on the content of these programs.
</p><p>Once television animation became associated with children, the producers of animated shows began writing down to their presumed audience, which made animation outside the age ghetto less profitable than animation inside it. Anything considered safe for children can potentially be licensed out for merchandise, which is nearly guaranteed to sell, making many shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">30-minute commercials</a>, FCC regulations permitting. The age ghetto paints older demographics as unprofitable.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>These days, the ghetto appears to have all but completely collapsed, due to the successes of Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> as well as American shows as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, though some of these shows' reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VulgarHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VulgarHumor">Vulgar Humor</a> has led to a new misconception that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark">adult-oriented works of animation are self-consciously tasteless comedies</a>. Similarly, many people assume that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">All Anime Is Naughty Tentacles</a>. However, in some regions of the world, such as Mexico and other Latin American countries, the ghetto is still alive and well.
</p><p>The Internet also helped break the ghetto. Before Internet access became widespread, animated short films (which in general have mature themes) were only available in universities that catered towards that specific field, but the Internet helped many artists publish those projects for a mainstream audience. Similarly, anime aimed at adults was limited to science fiction conventions and college campuses, but now has a worldwide following. On the other hand, the Internet-based ghetto tends to reach the other way; thanks to animation's growing reputation as a medium for all demographics, many forum users sometimes express surprise that a well-written show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">made purely for kids</a> or try to play up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal">Multiple Demographic Appeal</a> to separate it from "other" kids' shows, thanks to the ghetto stereotype of "for kids = bad writing."
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>To a lesser extent, the same goes with animated feature films. Yes, there are pure kiddieville films made, but if you want to make big money in that field, you <em>must</em> appeal to adults at some level. Although this applies chiefly to films made out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon">3D computer graphics</a> as traditional 2D animation is still not taken seriously. Thus 2D is regarded as "dead" by the Western animation industry whereas 3D can serve as a compromise between animation and live action.

<ul><li> The cartoon advertising mascot <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Camel">Joe Camel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the subject of heavy controversy throughout his ten-year existence, because various anti-smoking activists believed that the campaign was targeting children. The campaign was only intended for adults, but there <em>was</em> genuine evidence that more children were aware of the Camel brand because of the ads; in any case, Camel bowed to the controversy and retired Joe in 1997.
<ul><li> In general, if a company has a cartoon mascot, that will make it more well-known among children, even if their product isn't intended for children. One of the best-known examples is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GEICO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GEICO">Geico Gecko.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In 1989, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> narrated an animated awareness film for charity, showing what happens during the annual pilot whale hunt in the Faroe Islands. Despite the extremely disturbing visuals of screaming whales being harpooned, eaten, and the leftovers dumped on the beach to rot, the film received a PG rating in Britain simply because it was a cartoon. And then, as part of a campaign to get it played in front of <em>Where the Whales Came</em>, it got re-rated to a <em>U</em>.
<ul><li> There are two versions of this advert; one with a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWgrl0377Kg">U rating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and one with a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAy1d2pF-H8">PG rating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> According to the BBFC's archives, there is a difference of two seconds in running time between the two versions (the U version ran for 1 minute but the PG version ran for 58 seconds) and they were also released under different names; the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/whales-and-dolphins-conservation-society-scream-1970-0">U version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was called 'Scream' and the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAy1d2pF-H8">PG version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was called 'Faroe Islands'.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It should be noted that for decades, Japan itself held onto the idea that anime should all be kid oriented: wacky comedy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> shows, and heavily watered down manga adaptations were the name of the game. That lasted until the mid-to-late seventies, where the impact of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> proved that yes, you can make cartoon shows aimed towards adults.
<ul><li> <em>Gundam</em> itself suffered from this during the original TV series' run; despite the fact that the show featured adult themes such as realistic depictions of war, weapons of mass destruction, doomed romance and the death of several major characters, the show's sponsors insisted on publishing <em>Gundam</em> picture books for preschoolers - and then complained to the production staff that the books weren't selling. It was only late in the run, when the show started to build up a base of hardcore fans among teenagers and college students, that the franchise began showing signs of becoming the merchandising juggernaut we know and love today.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nielsen ratings for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> are often considered to be an example of this. While this trope is subverted for their comedy titles, it is sadly played straight for most of their Anime titles. After the revival of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a>, this is starting to change though, with the front-running shows consistently getting excellent ratings, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> regularly beating out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> in the 18-49 demographic.
</li><li> In-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldOfNarue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldOfNarue">The World of Narue</a></em>. Kazuto's mother complains to him when he shows his girlfriend a magical girl anime series because, according to her, "cartoons are for kids". If you've seen the sort of Seinen magical series that the show is mocking, you'd disagree.
</li><li> One of the reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> was such a groundbreaking film was that it helped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> break out of this in the West. It was by no means the first mature anime, but it was the first to receive enough attention outside of Japan. These days, a lot of Western people view or even expect <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">all</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">anime as being on that end of the maturity scale</a>, though. Still, <em>AKIRA</em> may be found on display in some stores at the "Kids" segment, right next to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, thanks to employees not reading the box.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em>: In Puerto Rico, a Sunday Morning Kid's show aired four episodes of the Anime series, even though it features skimpy outfits, suggestive scenes and dialogue and people getting holes punched through them by Psychogun blasts. In every episode. Note: This isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>; it was yanked off the air a month later without any public explanation once they realized what they'd done.
</li><li> France used to have no problem with shows like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClubDorothee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClubDorothee">Club Dorothée</a></em> broadcasting the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em> in a time slot intended for kids; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> used to in the 8 am or 10 am slot on TF1 back in the 1990s. This series sometimes has someone dying, bleeding to death, being dismembered, exploding etc., every other episode. This led to rather awkward dubbing from the voice actors, who had a hard time making the constant violence appear light-hearted, and to some protestations by parental associations. With the rehabilitation of animated media, much work has been put in making over the dubbing; anime is now viewed as a full-blown genre with its own specifications. Yet, censorship dies hard; Bowdlerisation still happens when the show's intended audience is too wide. <br/><br/>France is actually an interesting example of <em>too much</em> acceptance; the quality of localization went from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">mediocre</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">in the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">'80s</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">decent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">90's</a>, to downright <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun">good</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">in the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">late 90's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">early</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2000s</a>; by the late noughties, however, the sheer amount of imported material, and more importantly money to make off of it, led to droves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">rushed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">cash-in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">dubs</a> bringing the average quality right back to mediocre.
<ul><li> In <em>Naruto</em>'s case, the trope is played with. In France, they have no fewer than <strong>three</strong> French dubs, all from the same company: an uncensored one for adults based on the Japanese version, a mildly censored one for teenagers, and a heavily censored one for small kids based on the English dub. One can't help but wonder which dub they intended to aim at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, not to mention what said demographic consists of.
</li><li> TF1 got into massive trouble when they aired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother">Dear Brother</a></em> in the <em>Club Dorothée</em> block. The show was cancelled after only 7 episodes. Was it maybe the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">lesbian subtext</a>, the drug abuse or the suicide themes?
</li><li> In 1988, France aired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a></em>, under the title <em>Cherry Miel</em>, in a kids time slot, while the show is basically the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> in anime. Funny thing is, while the opening theme was changed for the French dub, the visual side was left untouched, meaning that kids who watched the show back then got to see Honey being peeked at while taking a bath or having her breasts groped by Seiji, which is kind of ironic - the series was aired with practically no censorship save from the final episode, where a scene where Junpei gropes Honey was removed.
</li></ul></li><li> In the UK, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em>, which was dubbed and titled <em>G-Force: Guardians of Space</em>, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon">Saturday Morning Cartoon</a> complete with assassination, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMisogyny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMisogyny">monsters that only ate women</a>, and some fairly spectacular violence. They also aired, not just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Evangelion</a></em>, but the Shinji and Kaworu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Bath Scene</a>, at 10 am.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Evangelion</em>, Peruvian TV station America Latina aired it back-to-back with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> during the children's hour. It barely managed to make it to episode five before being swiped off the air.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the American "Making Of" featurette for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>, the actors go on and on about how the film was not what they expected, and how it was deep not just for animation, but for <em>actual</em> movies as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> itself falls squarely into this trope, which is a frequent point of criticism for older audiences, including fans of the <em>Pokémon</em> games and other media. In fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://pocketmonsters.net/main/news/1812">various artists hired for some of the later movies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have explicitly stated their intention to perform for the children in the audience and essentially mentioned how very young children would enjoy the movies, with no mention of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05uv9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note05uv9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05uv9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as their parents or nostalgic <em>Pokémon</em> fans</span> anywhere.
<ul><li> In its earlier days, <em>Pokémon</em>'s head writer Takeshi Shudo made a conscious effort to subvert this trope. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">the first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a> was released, Shudo stated that he made the movie to entertain both children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">and their parents and guardians</a>, and that he'd be "embarrassed" to hear from parents who'd only see the movie to take their kids. Of course, he was talking about the Japanese version, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">this was promptly thrown away when the movie was released internationally</a>. In fact, Shudo <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bulbagraphic:Translating_the_Blog_Entries_of_Mr._Shudo">wanted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>the entire series</em> to serve as a family anime and appeal to adults as well as children, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> prevented him from using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonuses</a> he wanted.
</li><li> The Kalos seasons, which are <em>Pokemon the Series: XY</em>, <em>Pokémon the Series: XY: Kalos Quest,</em> and <em>Pokemon the Series: XYZ</em>, are often seen as a subversion of this trope, due to their greater efforts to engage older fans with their better plotting and character development along with the Mega Evolution side story specials. However, the English version is still widely considered to be inferior due to factors such as dialogue changes, music replacement and the voice acting itself; some fans accuse these changes of being a result of a "kids will watch anything" mentality, and therefore chalk it up to this trope. Furthermore, when a trailer was released for the <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> anime, it came under fire from older fans for seemingly regressing into this trope with a goofier style akin to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em>. When the show actually came out, most of the fire died down, as the show managed to balance out hijinks and humor with mix-ups to series formula and surprisingly heartfelt arcs. In this case, the complainers ran into this trope on their own as well; they assumed that just because the show had <em>Yo-kai Watch</em>-style silliness and simplified designs, the season's writing would suffer for it.
</li></ul></li><li> Russian TV channel STS used to have an afternoon animated block, which was known to include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> right next to, say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales</a></em>. It was yanked off air pretty quickly.
</li><li> A poster on the IMDB forums relayed <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208210735/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108461/board/thread/99803695">a tale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a clueless mom who rented <em>Urotsukidoji</em> (also known as <em>The Legend of the Overfiend</em>) for her small kids. You'd almost think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis">Popcultural Osmosis</a> about its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a> content would have protected it from this kind of bullshit by now.
</li><li> A Portuguese TV channel aimed at kids, SIC K, frequently airs some less-child-friendly anime alongside the usual fare. They occasionally switch between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, while it airs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> consistently, two episodes a day. Slightly mitigated as most Portuguese parents today had grown up with shows like the aforementioned <em>Dragon Ball</em>, and, thus, they aren't as strict about what counts as acceptable.
<ul><li> For a better contrast, there's another Portuguese channel of the same type, Panda Biggs, aimed at at kids aged 10-15. Still, the most they get is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> and, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> which, while not Anime, serves to prove a point here.
</li></ul></li><li> For some time after the conclusion of <em>Evangelion</em>, when he was trying to make it as a director of "serious" films, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno</a> lamented the death of the age ghetto in Japan in several interviews and cited the abundance of adult anime fans as proof of Japanese culture's degeneracy. He seems to have changed his tune somewhat, as he has gone back to working on anime.
</li><li> The Irish DVD rental chain Xtravision charges 4 for a regular movie, but just 50¢ for kids movies — which include all anime.
</li><li> A website called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ActsOfGord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ActsOfGord">Acts of Gord</a> has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.actsofgord.com/Chronicles/chapter12.php">one section<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where this happens. Two children try to rent an anime named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NinjaScroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NinjaScroll">Ninja Scroll</a></em> that, due to its nature, is not a "family film". So thus he has to allow the kids' dad to come in to rent the film and he complains about having to come in "Just so they could rent a cartoon". When they go home and actually watch a little of the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">the father quickly comes back to castigate Gord for "letting" his kids rent pornography</a>.
</li><li> This trope is why all manga published in Italy includes the disclaimer "The characters depicted in this publication are all of age, and besides, they don't really exist, they're simply drawings" — because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">someone</a> protested about people getting hurt or killed and sexual content in a "children's book".
</li><li> The Animation Age Ghetto in Mexico is so strong that if it's animated, then it's automatically for kids even if it's the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>! Maybe that was why several shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, squarely and completely for teenagers, were aired on the kids' TV slot during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
<ul><li> Most 30-somethings in Mexico grew up watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Caballeros del Zodiaco</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> during their childhood or early teens, despite the former having way too much Gorn for a "kid's cartoon". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">The net effect of this is that now many parents consider most of these cartoons as acceptable for their kids, as this is what they watched when they were kids</a>. However, <em>manga</em> is treated differently and is accordingly separated by those comic bookstores selling them.
</li><li> Averted like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">bloody</a></em> hell with the Mexican Spanish dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em>: You know, a series infamous for having a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">underage-looking vampire</a></em> as the main protagonist who had a crush on her older-looking werewolf bodyguard and gets undressed <em>many times</em>, that the American version was edited because of that. One could think the Mexican version could have used the American version, since it's safer and cheaper than the original Japanese version. They used the uncensored Japanese version instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Colombia suffers from this too. In Caracol TV <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> aired at the kid's schedule weekends 10:00 A.M or sorts. It roughly went to episode 5, even edited, until the network realized what they got themselves into. Then they moved it to the comfortable <em>5:00 A.M</em> on weekends... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">still</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">edited</a>. The same goes for <em>Evangelion</em>.
</li><li> Parts of the United States still waver back and forth over this. American bookstore chains tend to attach slim sign disclaimers onto the Manga shelves with messages like "Some of these publications are not suitable for children", warding off any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> that may complain about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre">Yaoi Genre</a> comics in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">"kid's section"</a>. Barnes and Noble outlets have moved the manga and comic book sections farther and farther away from the shelves of children's books over the years. To put this into perspective, ten years ago, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga was shelved with children's novels like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicTreehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicTreehouse">The Magic Treehouse</a></em> series. The manga may have had poor translation, but wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">covering up Haruka and Michiru's homosexuality</a> and censoring some of the violence the way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> dub did... Nowadays, most manga that include graphic violence or sexual themes have a parental advisory label on them as a permanent part of the cover, and may be individually shrink-wrapped so that kids can't take it off the shelf and flip through them. <br/><br/>However, several American libraries merely assume that, unless it's something like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, all manga and comics <em>in general</em> are for kids and <em>kids ONLY</em>. It's not uncommon to see a kid friendly comic being placed right next to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalShoppingArcadeAbenobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalShoppingArcadeAbenobashi">Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi</a></em>. Most manga has a label on it saying whether it was kid friendly or <em>NOT</em> - 'course librarians tend to not notice. Then again, miscategorization of stuff happens quite a bit in libraries - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> books are placed in the Juvenile fiction section with <em>the labels SAYING</em> "Juvenile fiction" on them, as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a></em> books placed in adults section, when clearly, you can get away with having those in the juvenile section.
</li><li> Subverted and somewhat played straight in the Philippines. Until the 1960s-70s, perceptions on animation more or less followed American ones. The first influx of anime (eg. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV">Voltes V</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos">Daimos</a></em>) in the country, however, helped weaken the Ghetto; <em>Voltes V</em>, in particular became a nigh revolutionary totem for Filipinos against the Marcos regime. Yet to this day, despite a solid otaku and comics community, the Ghetto stubbornly refuses to fade outright into irrelevance.
<ul><li> What makes the case of the Philippines more peculiar is the context behind the growing acceptance of anime and manga: by the 1960s and '70s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Filipinos' resentment towards Japan</a> gradually began to fade away as younger generations became more willing to forgive their former invaders. In addition, they provided an alternative to the predominance of Western shows as well as reflecting elements of Japanese culture that are similar to their own.
</li></ul></li><li> The Animation Age Ghetto is surprisingly strong in Japan's next door neighbor South Korea. A horrifying example of this was that a Korean dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing Ultimate</a></em> was being sold in a Seoul bookstore... in the same section and shelf as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PororoTheLittlePenguin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PororoTheLittlePenguin">Pororo the Little Penguin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a>.</em> Apparently, store owners just don't care if an oblivious Korean family confuses a mature anime for a children's cartoon...
<ul><li> And that's not even getting to the treatment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, which was seen by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> as a nationalist propaganda piece, given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">historical problems</a> between Japan and Korea. This was also partly the reason why the anime abandoned its original TV broadcast plans for web-streaming.
</li><li> Adult animation does exist in South Korea, however. Probably the best-known example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TheKingOfPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TheKingOfPigs">The King of Pigs</a></em>, which was released in 2011 to critical acclaim worldwide. A gritty, tragic story that deals with institutionalized bullying and suicide, it is definitely not for kids.
</li></ul></li><li> In Germany most anime is broadcast between 10am and 3pm. This includes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles">The Rose of Versailles</a></em>, with its remarkably faithful translation. One of the rare occasions you can see cartoon young girls offering to sell their bodies, other women claiming to be the lesbian sex slave of the queen of France and kids getting shot while eating your lunch. Oh yeah, and for a short time they broadcast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">rewritten</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em> at 10am. Kids probably rejoiced when Mitsy hysterically searched the whole house for her dildo.
</li><li> A good number of anime fans believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> are firm believers of this due to their infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerisation</a> and censorship.

</li><li> Not only that, but sometimes, the sponsored items on anime that are intended for a much younger audience than what it appears on. It's very common to see a work like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>, for instance, have DVDs aimed at kids like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouseClubhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouseClubhouse">Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</a></em> advertised as featured products.
</li></ul></li><li> This mentality is part of the reason behind the stillbirth of the Hungarian anime market. When the first commercial TV stations started showing anime at the end of the '90s, they all aired as a part of an afternoon children's block. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> then, despite being tame compared to some of the series described above and having been dubbed from the heavily edited French version, shocked parents with its violence, and it had to be pulled when the ORTT (Hungarian FCC) deemed it too violent for children. It was to be re-rated as 18+ and pushed to a midnight timeslot, but since no one watched it then, the TV station simply canceled it. Its case was reevaluated in '02 and was given a 16+ rating, but the channel decided against continuing it because they wanted to aim all animated productions at children, reinforcing the "cartoons are for kids" notion. It took a decade for <em>DBZ</em> to get back on screens, this time in a teen and adult animation block on a UK-based channel that's more lenient with certifications. <br/><br/>While anime was gaining a foothold in many other European areas, the canning of all anime series in the naughties has lead to the anime market becoming a strictly underground business in Hungary. The middle of the 2000s had another small anime-boom, but with similar results. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> took <em>DBZ</em>'s place as ORTT's whipping-boy, because it was <em>again</em> advertised as a kids' show and aired in an early-morning timeslot. Following its cancellation and the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">Network Decay</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax">Animax</a>, TV channels as a whole gave up on importing anime because they had no one to market them towards. "Anime" came to mean "kids shows not suitable for kids" to the general audience, and the occasional reruns of <em>DBZ</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> are the sole reminders of a market that got stifled by the combined might of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a> before it could have even gotten off the ground.
<ul><li> The station airing the aforementioned two series experimented with anime from 2012 to '15. They did everything to downplay the effects of this trope, but since their target demographic is people aged 18-49, and <em>DBZ</em> and <em>GX</em> only attracted viewers under the age of 30, they have also axed all potential future anime imports, arguing that anime just can't reach an older audience.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, save for some minor edits, didn't suffer this problem when it originally aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>. Years down the road, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> decided to buy the broadcasting rights to the considerably more violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> <em>Shippuden.</em> While Cartoon Network had no problem embracing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, Disney did not seem prepared for how violent the series would eventually get. It's disappeared from Disney XD's lineup and has since returned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> with minimal edits.
</li><li> Amazon <em>very briefly</em> carried titles from the company Project-H on Amazon Kindle, where any child could see the sexually explicit covers, <em>listed as normal graphic novels right next to the Superman/Batman/Fairy Tail graphic novels.</em> Understandably, they have all been removed from Kindle purchase, though Skinemax-esque titles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoiHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoiHouse">Aoi House</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VampireCheerleaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VampireCheerleaders">Vampire Cheerleaders</a></em> are still available.
</li><li> This trope is actually partly responsible for the popularity of anime in the West. Most Western animation companies produce TV shows and movies aimed at kids. Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal">Multiple Demographic Appeal</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> and later-day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>, their movies are still aimed primarily at children and families. The "adult" shows tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark">rather juvenile</a> as well. People who are into animation and want animated shows with the depth and seriousness of quality live-action series and movies often have no other choice but to watch anime, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen">Seinen</a> anime.
<ul><li> Even then, this trope settles in: as most of the anime that tends to get exported are generally made for a teen to adult audience, it colors the perception that <em>anime</em> is for adults while <em>cartoons</em> are for kids.

This is why Disney opted to release the dub under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms">Miramax Films</a> label.
<ul><li> HBO Max classifies this film under "Family", along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnlyYesterday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnlyYesterday">Only Yesterday</a></em>, the latter of which was notable for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not being released in the US due to a scene in which</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">a group of boys look under the skirts of girls to see if they're menstrating</a>. Luckily, this was averted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises">The Wind Rises</a></em>, since it is a more arthouse-style film.
</li></ul></li><li> In many discussions of dating dealbreakers, perspective paramours being fans of anime or manga will often come up. These people seem to think that liking anything animated at all is a sign of immaturity.
</li><li> Despite all of the anti-anime raids the country used to have The Netherlands is the biggest aversion of this trope to date, with heavy "manga-movies" such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> getting a rating as high as 12+. It seems that animated slash films were never released. Perhaps that explains why there was no controversy when <a class="urllink" href="http://www.illumatie.nl/bunbuns/animations.html">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was published.
</li><li> For the 86th Academy Awards, 19 animated features were submitted, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises">The Wind Rises</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ALetterToMomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ALetterToMomo">A Letter to Momo</a></em>.

Compare this kind of behavior to the one present in the Cannes film festival, where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut">Inside Out</a></em> won the price of jury for the best not competing film in 2015 without any need to submit itself whatsoever.
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em> failed to get a nomination while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRedTurtle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRedTurtle">The Red Turtle</a></em> which co-produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> got one for the Oscars 2017, this made many anime fans wondering if the voters have a bias on Studio Ghibli. But the real reason is that Funimation, who is in charge of the North American distribution of <em>Your Name</em>, failed to give the movie a wide release in the US and only showed it in one week in Los Angeles in order for it to be qualified in the nomination shortlist. The film did won an award for Best Animated Feature by the Los Angeles Film Critics Circle and got two Annie Awards nominations but without a wide release, the Academy voters are unable to see the film. Justin Sevakis shed some light on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-01-27/.111446">this matter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> is a notable exception. His critical reputation in the West is on par with the best live-action directors.

It aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlemishTVStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlemishTVStations">2BE</a>, a network that at the time was well-known for relying on high-quality US-imported television and that aired shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops">COPS</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> long before Dragon Ball Z was considered as an import.

</li><li> In 2017, British-American kickboxer Andrew Tate <a class="urllink" href="http://thehypedgeek.com/this-mma-fighter-just-made-fun-of-anime-fans/">tweeted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that "anime fans over 15 are losers who'll never get respect from women", followed up with another tweet saying that "anime is for losers". Within two days his tweets gained universally negative feedback from both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> and the anime community.

Todomatsu achieves perfect properness, transcending animation to become a live-action character.
<ul><li> Not to say the show itself hasn't been subject to the same line of thinking. It's listed under the "kids" section of Hulu Japan, some of its wearable merch comes in children's sizes, and <a class="urllink" href="https://whateveritsmyplace.tumblr.com/post/143680240777/ciao-mag-20166-book-aikatsu-stars-card">it was advertised<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em>Ciao</em>, a magazine for elementary school girls.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime/manga focused magazines OtakuUSA and AnimeUSA are placed with magazines aimed at children in Kroger and Wal-Mart stores, despite the fact that the anime featured in them are usually aimed <em>at least</em> teenagers and above. There's also reviews for 18+ yaoi manga in every issue of OtakuUSA, as well as a J-List ad which shows the covers to several eroge games.
</li><li> The BPO is a well-known group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> in Japan that send in complaints to any children's or all-ages show with objectionable content. Some of those complaints are for teen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi">ecchi</a> shows and anime running at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuOClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuOClock">Otaku O'Clock</a>, a time when kids wouldn't even be watching. Naturally, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-09-12/bpo-publishes-complaint-about-everyone-writing-in-those-late-night-anime-complaints/.136690">one of the complaints sent to them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is about how counter-intuitive that is.
</li><li> Expressed from the opposite direction with some series that <em>are</em> made for adults: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Josei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Josei">Josei</a> anime like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RilakkumaAndKaoru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RilakkumaAndKaoru">Rilakkuma and Kaoru</a></em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seinen">Seinen</a> works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsTheOrderARabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsTheOrderARabbit">Is the Order a Rabbit?</a></em> are often picked on by anime enthusiasts for not being "adult" enough. Just like children's media doesn't always have to be bright and cheery, adults' media doesn't have to always be dark and gritty.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, this is also the primary reason behind Josei manga have more live-action adaptations over animated ones than seinen manga. The usual school of thought is that adult women would want to see their stories realized with real people, since animation tends to be made for the young adult crowd and lower.
</li><li> On Amazon Instant Video, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD">CLANNAD</a></em> anime is listed as "Family." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">This is a series that has child abuse, neglect, teenage pregnancy and death by childbirth</a>.

<ul><li> This — not the expected copyright issues — is the basis for nearly any and all controversy over art exhibitions that depict subversions of classic cartoons, such as "Animatus" and "Splatter". With that in mind, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">the very first line</a> in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3123418/Cartoon-characters-brutally-killed-in-new-Bugs-Bunny-and-Daffy-Duck-art-exhibition.html">this typical report on the latter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> It may be a stretch to call Spike and Mike animation festivals "art", but it's an even longer stretch to consider them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">kid friendly</a>. That said, the notoriety of Spike and Mike's has never stopped woefully ignorant parents from bringing their children to what they believe to be a bunch of short cartoons that'll keep their kids entertained for a couple of hours. It's called <em>Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Animation Festival</em> for a <em>reason</em>.
</li><li> So you wish to be taken seriously in art? Don't draw heavily stylized art that looks cartoonish (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a> or not) because for some reason, it isn't mature, even if your artwork depicts mature and gritty situations. This is part of the problem that most people assume that "mature" entertainment is gritty and violent, and for some, that's <em>only</em> what they want. Sadly, this mentality has caused a lot of people to feel pigeon-holed into drawing ultra-realistic art despite finding stylized stuff more appealing...and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">weird</a> realistic art often looks if it's not done correctly.
<ul><li> Averted by Takashi Murakami and the "superflat" movement.
</li><li> Should not be confused with people who encourage realistic art as a stepping stone to stylized art. The "know the rules before you break them" type of people.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Drawing was actually not considered to be a serious artistic medium throughout much of history.</a> It always had a submissive role back then. The serious media back then were either painted or sculpted. It took until the beginning of the 20th century before a drawing was considered art by mainstream critics.

<ul><li> In an extreme example, there have been cases as recently as 2000 where comic book specialty stores which had separate adult sections have been <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castillo_v._Texas">convicted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for corrupting minors, even though children weren't allowed into those areas of the store. The basis of the case is that if it is cartoon art, then it must be for children. Oh, and by "convicted," we don't just mean "forced to pay a fine and stop doing it." Some of the defendants in "obscene comic book" cases have been forced to (1) undergo psychological counseling, (2) undergo "journalistic ethics" courses, (3) avoid contact with minors, and/or (4) be subject to unannounced raids of their houses to check to see if they're in possession of or in the process of creating "obscenity". First Amendment rights, anyone? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Maybe it's time for you to go donate to the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</a>.
</li><li> A married couple made headlines after complaining about a couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> comics one of their children had purchased. The two claimed that they were shocked to find blood and partial nudity in a medium aimed at children, even though that specific series was <em>not</em> marketed at kids.
</li><li> This trope is the major reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Alias">Alias</a></em> was cancelled, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>. In the wake of the big superhero movie boom, Marvel had grown nervous about kid-friendly characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> showing up in a book with drug abuse, sex crimes, graphic violence, and lots of F-bombs.
</li><li> One of the reasons the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a></em> features in <em>Detective Comics</em> drew so much controversy was because some conservatives accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> of pushing a "homosexual agenda" on young kids. Never mind that <em>Detective Comics</em> is usually quite violent and like most Batman books, is generally <em>not</em> aimed at young children. And of course given the strides taken for gay rights in the U.S., the idea of a lesbian superhero being "taboo" for children is itself controversial.
</li><li> Partial example: Apparently some libraries put <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhenTheWindBlows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhenTheWindBlows">When the Wind Blows</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RaymondBriggs">Raymond Briggs</a> in the children's section. It's a graphic novel in the same style as his books for children, but... it ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main characters dying horribly of radiation sickness</span>. Although some libraries are aware of this trope and puts a big warning sticker for adults only.
</li><li> In an unusual case of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb">Robert Crumb</a>, practically the patron saint of adult-oriented underground cartooning (and oh <em>lawdy</em> not at all for kids!), is somewhat cynical about the wave of "artistic" comic books and (I'm paraphrasing here) thinks comics should stick to their more proletarian roots.
</li><li> Libraries that follow the Dewey Decimal System put all comics and graphic novels in the nonfiction section as books about art. Most libraries instead put them, along with manga, in a single subsection of fiction. This section is almost always inside the children's area, and no exceptions are made even for works that are specifically marked "for adults only" (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>, which has a black banner to that effect on the cover of the American omnibus edition.) This is gradually being altered in some places. The San Francisco main library has three separate manga sections: children, adult, and teen.
<ul><li> The Flagstaff, Arizona public library has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em> — which features (admittedly offstage) rape, dismemberment, and cannibalism — in the YA comics section.
</li><li> The London, Ontario Public Library Central Branch has similarly three age sections, but they are each placed in three locations with the children's graphic novels in the Children's library area, the teen ones in the Teen Annex on the first floor while the Adult books are placed on the third floor as part of the adult fiction collection.
</li></ul></li><li> A certain manga scanlation site used to have the following <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldInflation">specifically-bolded</a></strong> intro: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">In Japan people of all ages read manga</a>, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">manga does not target younger audiences like American comics</a></strong>." The part isn't bolded now, but the wording of the intro hasn't been changed.
</li><li> During the 1950's, the comic book industry was nearly destroyed. Why? A psychiatrist named Fredric Wertham (not entirely a bad guy, mind you, as he spoke out a lot against school segregation) noticed that a lot of the troubled boys he worked with described "reading comic books" as their favorite activity. Failing to take into account that pretty much every young boy at the time read comic books (not to mention failing to ask what <em>kind</em> of comics they read because comics, like regular books, have many different genres and sub-genres), he assumed that the comic books must've been the reason for their bad behavior. He published a book titled "The Seduction of the Innocent" and launched a crusade against comic books. There was even a <em>Senate Hearing</em> about it. Because of all the bad press, the comic book industry had to adopt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">The Comics Code</a>. Few stores would even sell comics that didn't have the seal. To get the seal, the comic had to adhere to a lot of rules, many similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">The Hays Code</a> for movies. The rules were so strict on the basis that comic books were only for children, and the rules made it so that comics had to be pretty kid-friendly to get the seal, and as a result, the publishing of "adult" comics either stopped or went underground because of the Code. The Code is now defunct, as just about every comic book company has stopped adhering to it. To his credit, Dr. Wertham didn't actually <em>want</em> the Comics Code Authority to be created—he just wanted comics to have some sort of rating system.
</li><li> To mention in more detail, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>. This is actually a rather interesting example of the trope being zig-zagged. While you normally can find it around the same section as comic books, graphic novels, and manga, before it was put in the kids' sections somewhat frequently. The interesting part is that you actually <em>can</em> get away with putting <em>Tintin</em> books in the kids' section because at worst, the books would probably only get a "PG" rating. However, at the same time, kids wouldn't quite get all the political satire evident, later on (mis)interpreting it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a>.
<ul><li> However, libraries never stocked <em>Tintin in the Congo</em> or <em>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</em>, mostly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> oozing out of every page. That, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Hergé himself admitted he wasn't proud of them</a>, and a lot of Tintin fans don't think they were that good either, so arguably you're not missing much.
</li><li> The TV series was usually run at a timeslot that was appropriate for Nick Jr. However, as mentioned, they did not try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating">Avoid the Dreaded G Rating</a>, instead embracing it. How many cartoons would teach the kids about drug smuggling?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmahaTheCatDancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmahaTheCatDancer">Omaha the Cat Dancer</a></em> is a subversion. It was rated for All Ages in New Zealand by a national censor bureau, with its sex and all, not because they didn't read it, but because <em>they did</em> and judged its truly mature depiction of relationships as quite acceptable material.
</li><li> The reason behind the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> reboot is firmly rooted to this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> firmly believed that a married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> could not attract a younger audience to the comic.
</li><li> There's a story about Wendy and Richard Pini of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> fame receiving a letter from a parent who was outraged at an issue of <em>ElfQuest</em> that included a scene of an orgy, saying that her son read the comic. This is despite the fact that <em>ElfQuest</em> was dark, sexual and violent from the beginning. She clearly was not paying much attention to what her kid was reading...

When it runs arcs dealing with highly controversial or non-kid-friendly topics, some papers will replace that arc with reruns or move the strip to the editorial page.
</li><li> Although Webcomics usually subvert this trope, a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComics">Web Comics</a> readers who have children will show their children some of the Webcomics that they read even if the original creators didn't intend for them to be read by children. Though at least the parents know exactly what's in the Webcomics that they're showing to their children.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a> made adult cartoons (with one of his films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat">Fritz the Cat</a></em>, being pictured above) as an attempt to prove that animation wasn't just for kids, but his films still ended up being poorly received because of this (though a majority of them have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>). Others, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolWorld">Cool World</a></em>, became the victims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> thanks to this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> holds the philosophy that animation can be both dark <strong>and</strong> lighthearted at the same time, and that children can handle more than most adults believe, just as long as you gave them a (relatively) happy ending; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a></em> is probably the shining example of that philosophy. Needless to say, studio executives don't feel the same way, which is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> forced him to essentially abandon this philosophy not long after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a></em>; in fact, Bluth wanted to add darker elements to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockADoodle">Rock-A-Doodle</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePebbleAndThePenguin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePebbleAndThePenguin">The Pebble and the Penguin</a></em>, but the studios wouldn't let him because they wanted the films to appeal more to kids.
<ul><li> Part of the reason that his last movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE">Titan A.E.</a></em>, flopped was because the filmmakers didn't know whether to market it towards children or towards teenaged Sci-Fi fans (not even the VHS release was certain- you had a trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">X-Men</a></em> followed by a promo for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids">Fox Kids</a> still existed at that point).
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE">Titan A.E.</a></em>, it was accompanied by a number of other animated movies that attempted to break out of the Ghetto, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtlantisTheLostEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtlantisTheLostEmpire">Atlantis: The Lost Empire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet">Treasure Planet</a>.</em> All of them were box-office failures. This was partly because at the time, the formulaic Disney movies of the 1990s had caused their target audience to become uninterested in animation, and partly because by then CGI films like <em>Shrek</em> were deconstructing and satirizing 90s-era films and thus were much more attractive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em> was actually one of the earliest and most notable attempts to break out of the Ghetto. It was released in 1940, at a time when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> was trying to prove that animation was every bit as "serious" a medium as live-action. As an artistic movie with a soundtrack of classical music, no real narrative, and some rather family-unfriendly visuals (it remains to this day the only film in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a> to show <em>naked breasts</em>), it was aimed at a decidedly more adult audience that <em>Snow White</em> or <em>Pinocchio</em>. Unfortunately, it's box-office failure caused Disney to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">abandon plans for further movies in the same vein</a>, and may even have indirectly contributed to the Ghetto as we know it.
</li><li> As said by a talking cotton ball in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonHertzfeldt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonHertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a> short, the intro for the theatrical touring festival <em>The Animation Show</em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Talking Cotton Ball 1:</strong> An animated film is not just a random series of mindless, self-indulging, violent cartoon images meant only to be enjoyed by young children or people with mental handicaps, but is a serious, valid art medium all unto itself which the artist is free to explore the purity of the film medium, down to each and every single frame. The animated arts are— <br/><strong>Talking Cotton Ball 2</strong>: <em>(pointing)</em> <strong>Roboooooooots!</strong>
</div></li><li> Despite being made by Nelvana, a company known for more kid-friendly shows such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears">Care Bears</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin">Franklin</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockAndRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockAndRule">Rock &amp; Rule</a></em> isn't a kids' movie as it features scenes of drug use, sexual content, slight profanity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and even implied satanism</a>. The film is more of young teens, however, as lot of this is pretty mild.
</li><li> The animated movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a></em> was ridiculously, obviously not for kids. Extremes of violence and sex were fairly common in the short, rock cc-based vignettes that made up the original. In the flop sequel years later, the vignettes and much of the music were done away with, and most of the violence and sex were removed, toned down to something in the general vicinity of a PG-13 movie, maybe pushing R at best. It seems that even when making a sequel to a <em>blatantly</em> adult animated movie, you still need to make it not too adult.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> did an episode where everyone indulging in a new drug craze (cat piss) went into the Heavy Metal world. They did a great job not only on the animation but on pointing out what makes things allowed or not. The entire design of the fantasy world was breasts - walls, chairs, vehicles, everything was made of breasts, none of it censored. The only breasts that were not allowed were the ones on the woman. When she takes off her top the camera cuts away.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the number one reason for the reputation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em>. It's about cute fluffy rabbits, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the story is for kids, but nobody should let their children watch it alone because of its harsh depiction of nature and onscreen gore.
<ul><li> The BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) <em>still</em> receives complaints to this day from angry parents who showed their children what they thought was a cute, bunny adventure movie. The film is also rated as a 'U' (meaning anyone can watch it) rather than the more suitable 'PG', which can lead to people thinking the film is harmless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePlagueDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePlagueDogs">The Plague Dogs</a></em> (from the same team) has less of a problem because "plague" is in the title of the movie; even with plague in the title, though, the marketers still try to make <em>The Plague Dogs</em> look like a kids' movie (for example, the poster for the <em>The Plague Dogs</em> reads "Escape to a different world and share the adventure of lifetime"), despite showing things like starving to death, while having crazy hallucinations and trying to avoid being shot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Felidae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Felidae">Felidae</a></em> tends to fall victim to this phenomenon for similar reasons. A movie about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteKitten">cute kitties</a>, probably another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats">Aristocats</a></em>? Nope. It's actually more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">violent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>. Director Michael Schaack isn't exactly famous for kid-friendly animation, but those who buy the DVD with the kitty on it certainly don't check if it was made by the same guy who also made movies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Werner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Werner">Werner</a></em> and <em>The Little Asshole</em>.
</li><li> One DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLastUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLastUnicorn">The Last Unicorn</a></em> included commercials for shows targeted at young children (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a></em>). While it's a cartoon movie about a unicorn, it's no <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em>...
</li><li> According to an interview with the director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster">The Brave Little Toaster</a></em> when the movie was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, several judges outright <em>told</em> the director that it was the best movie at the festival, but they refused to give that title to a cartoon because they thought the award wouldn't be taken seriously.
</li><li> One of the very earliest animated films was Winsor McCay's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSinkingOfTheLusitania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSinkingOfTheLusitania">The Sinking of the Lusitania</a></em>. The kiddies must have flocked to it back in 1918. At that time, it should be remembered, the Ghetto as we know it didn't really exist yet. Adults were every bit as fascinated by the new medium as children were.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> is for kids and rated PG, but it features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eye mutilation</a>. In fact, some countries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">would not have an animated movie being shown in the theatres</a> if it's not kid-friendly enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Nine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Nine">9</a></em> was quite literally forced into the ghetto against its will: not only did it have a decidedly gloomy aesthetic, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">well-earned</a> PG-13 rating and <em>multiple</em> advertisements stating that it was "not your kid brother's cartoon movie," inattentive parents still brought their young children to see what they ultimately had to leave midway through, when said child started wailing at all of the scary imagery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron">The Black Cauldron</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> intentionally made it to appeal to teenaged fans of fantasy novels in the '80s and they were actually afraid that it would be rated "PG-13" or even "R". Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, producing an animated feature rated "PG-13" or "R" was unthinkable for Disney. This fear has also been blamed for the famously uneven tone.
<ul><li> Then again, Disney has a reputation for kid-friendliness and they've only released films rated higher than PG-13 under alternate labels. They created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TouchstonePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TouchstonePictures">Touchstone Pictures</a> brand so they could distribute films, starting with 1984's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash">Splash</a></em>, that they couldn't release under the standard Disney label.
</li><li> Until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em>, Disney didn't even release PG-13 films under its own name. And it was a big thing in 1979, when Disney released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackHole">The Black Hole</a></em> as a PG-rated movie, although more some video releases of live-action Disney movies from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> were rated PG.
</li></ul></li><li> Partly responsible for the pre-production demise in 1998 of a CGI-animated film by Rainbow Studios (which now does strictly video games and was acquired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ">THQ</a> in 2001), variously titled as "Deadly Tide" and "Blue Planet". Since this was a violent action movie squarely for adults and older teens, it failed to garner enough funding, and only a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHlwzVqFNCA">promo trailer using the "Blue Planet" title<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was ever produced. The trailer both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">thoroughly demolishes</a> the Animation Age Ghetto, by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Lawyer Friendly Cameos</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Buzz Lightyear</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife">Flik</a> engage silly antics, before being stomped on by a power-armoured soldier, and segueing into a rapid-cut action scene scored with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie">White Zombie's "More Human Than Human"</a>, a song whose title, as well as some of the lyrics, were taken from dialogue in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>.

Odds are, if you're reading this page, you probably fall into category 3, and good for you.
</li><li> A segment on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>'s <em>Good Morning America</em> on February 24th, 2011 discussed how no animated movie has ever won an Academy Award, on the basis that the Academy thinks that animated movies are always just for kids and only for kids, despite knowing that Oscar-winning actors and actresses have contributed to these films as far back as Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>, which even earned Walt Disney an Honorary Oscar. Despite being largely for kids overall, some films today have more adult themes and issues that kids wouldn't recognize, but the Academy refuses to see things that way.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rango">Rango</a></em>... just for starters, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Western</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a>, with all the things such a thing needs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyViolence">Family-Unfriendly Violence</a>, mild swearing, and of course, jokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">most kids wouldn't understand</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Antz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Antz">Antz</a></em> received guff from some critics who felt the film couldn't decide whether it was for kids or adults (the film included a rather graphic depiction of insect battle, a pinchful of mild cursewords, and one line with a ticked-off Z telling the princess that she could "just forget starring in any of [his] erotic fantasies" in the future). It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DuelingWorks/FilmAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DuelingWorks/FilmAnimated">it came out at roughly the same time as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife">A Bug's Life</a></em>, which is very definitely meant for kids.
</li><li> The Scandinavian DVD release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica">Beavis and Butt-Head Do America</a></em> highlights the differences between rating systems in different countries very handily, with <em>five</em> different ratings for <em>six</em> different countries on the packaging and disc: The film is rated 15-and-up in Denmark and Ireland, 12-and-up in the UK, 11-and-up in Norway, <em>7-and-up in Sweden</em> <strong>and 3-and-up in Finland</strong>, proving that repeated usage of "butt" and "ass" and words that start with those words + a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">Mushroom Samba</a> + <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">masturbation jokes</a> + gunplay somehow translate in Scandinavia to "kid-friendly entertainment".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> series has a complex relationship with this phenomenon. All four films had many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">jokes that kids could not understand and were intended for adults</a>, especially the first film - it even had a few curse words and they even made jokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatingForSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatingForSomething">ostensibly referring to a man's penis size</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Then again, if you're under 10 years old,</a> in which case, you'd see it as obviously just jokes about the guy's vertically challenged stature. Making matters worse is that Common Sense Media thinks it's appropriate for kids six and up, and that it was originally based on a book that <em>actually was for kids</em>. It says something about this trope when the series that prided itself on its all-ages appeal ended up being more heavily marketed to <em>preschoolers</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> than to all ages.
<ul><li> Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> did back in their day, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> was meant to appeal to both children and adults without seemingly favoring one group over the other, with its edgy humor and pop-culture references giving it a grittier vibe than other animated movies at the time - especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a>, which had a reputation for being "squeaky-clean". However, as time went on and <em>Shrek</em> became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>, marketing for the movies became more kid-focused even as the content of the movies was only <em>slightly</em> toned down. This caused the series to eventually gain a reputation of being "for kids", just like what happened to the Flintstones and Muppets. This is reflected in the evolution of the franchise's toyline: the first movie had a line of highly detailed collectibles by McFarlane Toys<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1xqlr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1xqlr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1xqlr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">yes, by Todd McFarlane of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a></em> fame</span> that could be appreciated by both kids and adults (just like the movie), while the toylines for the sequels (by Hasbro and MGA) were far cheaper and more gimmicky, and no longer targeted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> of action figure collectors.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2011 animated adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a></em> makes strides in escaping the ghetto, with its frequent use of firearms, pools of blood, and the use of alcohol and drunkenness for comedic effect. And yet, it got a PG rating. The film was initially being promoted under just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a> Pictures banner- until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon Movies</a> logo suddenly started showing up in ads. You can just picture the Paramount executive screaming, "What are we doing, releasing a kids' movie without promoting it as such?!"
</li><li> In Brazil and most of Latin America, the Animation Age Ghetto still goes very strong with nearly no sign of change. It's horrifying that the DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DeadSpaceDownfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DeadSpaceDownfall">Dead Space: Downfall</a></em> (a prequel to a video game that everyone knows isn't for kids) was in the children's section of a regional Blockbuster, with the cover image of a severed arm in space, placed just at eye height... to a five-year-old. The same could be found in other rental stores. Although the Brazilian rating system is very competent compared to most, being somewhat more strict but also more critical (the movie was correctly rated 18+ in a large black label, regardless of it being an animation, for "Murder, Mutilation and Cruelty", although neglecting to mention foul language and moral issues most likely because it wouldn't fit), most stores and consumers outright ignore it exists. The ones who do take notice of the ratings follow them blindly, forgetting they are just advice.
</li><li> This was an issue when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> managed to get a Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1991. Plenty of adults, including film critics, had heartily embraced it — it showed up on several critics' Top Ten lists for the year — and Disney, knowing what they had, cannily parlayed it into their Oscar campaign. Once it got its nomination, there were comments that it only showed how bad the live-action slate for the year had been, as if the Academy had been "reduced" to nominating it. Jokes were even made <em>during the Oscar telecast</em> about how a film consisting of "movable paintings" — as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyCrystal">Billy Crystal</a> put it in his opening number as host — was up against movies with live actors, who would <em>surely</em> be out of work if such movies continued to thrive.
<ul><li> It remains the only animated movie nominated for Best Picture in the period when five films per year received nominations, despite movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiritedAway">Spirited Away</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">Finding Nemo</a></em> getting more critical acclaim than almost any live-action film in their respective years. Some saw the Best Animated Feature in those years as a kind of backhanded compliment — a way to reward animated movies without acknowledging that they were good enough to compete with "real" movies.
</li><li> The 2019 Oscars prefaced the Best Animated Feature nominees with a variation on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s famous "When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness" quote, arguing that animation doesn't have to be hidden away because of its stigma and that its creators were able to put that youthful passion into their work — but it still carries the implication that it's inherently childish. Similarly, John Mulaney and Awkwafina's introduction to their categories had the pair talk about how they had no idea what to do on stage since they were new to presenting awards. Upon reading that they were presenting Best Animated Short Film first, they muttered about how they <em>probably</em> got "one of the good ones".
</li><li> A similar case could be made for the 2 new Césars that were introduced in 2011, specifically César of the Best Documentary and César of the Best Animated Film.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut">South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</a></em>. All the children (except for one kid) in South Park go see "Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire", which despite being rated R and the poster stating nobody under 17 can see the film, is not for children. This makes the kids start cussing and imitating things done in the movie. Due to this, the parents of the children start to protest Canada. During their song, "Blame Canada", one mother calls Asses of Fire a cartoon, possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the ghetto. Even the title was a big giveaway it wasn't for kids. A few movie critics also reported seeing parents taking their kids to go see the movie. No doubt <em>South Park</em>'s reputation completely evaded them.
</li><li> It's probably safe to say that the ghetto was enforced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuestForCamelot">Quest for Camelot</a></em>, as it was originally intended to stay true to the source material, which happens to be an Arthurian lore-based novel written by Vera Chapman called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King%27s_Damosel">''The King's Damosel''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the point where it would've gotten slapped with a PG-13 or even R rating, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> executives decided that a film like that wouldn't succeed, so they insisted that the film be toned down for a family audience. Ironically, those executives should've been careful what they wished for, as a decision like that caused an inversion of this trope by way of the film turning out to be a failure, as many people were pretty lucky to notice how much of a Disney knock-off it turned out to be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty">Sausage Party</a></em> can be summed up with a quote from the main page: "The biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">middle</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">finger</a> to the Animation Age Ghetto of the 21st century." Despite being probably the most child-unfriendly animated movie ever played in major theater chains—a fact made abundantly clear from the trailer, which barely scratches the surface of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">just how many lines it crosses</a>—and additional content warnings posted by the theaters themselves, some parents <em>still</em> obliviously brought their young children to see it...because it's an animated movie about talking food.
</li><li> Many parents thought <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon (Movie Film For Theaters)</a></em> was a kid friendly movie, and brought their kids to watch it. They were most certainly shocked to see <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loqYlYqtsmY">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> start up the film.
</li><li> Despite subject matter more suited for pre-teens and teenagers, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em> targets a very young audience with its cutesy characters/environments, a simple plot and having very little conflict. This also isn't helped by the fact that the movies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie">it is</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut">accused of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">ripping off</a> all broke out of the ghetto in their own ways. This is even reflected with the on-demand advertising, which says that it's good for a kids movie night even though G rated and PG rated animated movies are advertised as for families, as in <em>not</em> "just kids only", but <em>for</em> "both kids and adults". The film ended up turning the the ghetto on it head by being the first animated film to be nominated for <em>and</em> win....<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor">Worst Picture</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoldenRaspberryAward">the Razzies</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bkv5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bkv5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bkv5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It also was the first animated film at the awards show to be nominated for and win Worst Director, Worst Screen Combo, and Worst Screenplay.</span> So the film <em>did</em> actually break out of the ghetto like the films it was criticized for blatantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">riding the coattails of</a>...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">just not in the ways the studio likely intended</a>.
</li><li> Much like the aforementioned <em>Mumfie</em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> franchise has garnered a reputation for being a very kid-friendly franchise that's especially popular with preschoolers. With that in mind, whenever a more serious story is told with Pooh and company (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure">Pooh's Grand Adventure</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTiggerMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTiggerMovie">The Tigger Movie</a></em>, and the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristopherRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristopherRobin">Christopher Robin</a></em>), the movies often get a very mixed critical reception due to the perceived notion that more serious themes like the ones those films cover<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06x47');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06x47" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06x47');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <em>Grand Adventure</em> deals with the characters' reaction to Christopher Robin not showing up in the Hundred Acre Wood one day and going off to find him, getting in all manner of danger and coming face-to-face with their own flaws and insecurities along the way. <em>The Tigger Movie</em> is a somber but ultimately uplifting story about a lonely Tigger setting out to find his family of other Tiggers after wondering if he really is the only one. <em>Christopher Robin</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> story about Pooh and company re-entering Christopher Robin's life after Christopher Robin grew up into an overworked and glum adult after the innocence and wonder he had as a child was stamped out by stern school teachers, the death of his father, and fighting in World War 2.</span> have no place in a franchise like Winnie-the-Pooh. Despite this, all three movies were for the most part very positively-received by <em>Pooh</em> fans young and old alike.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> by the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nfb.ca/animation/">National Film Board of Canada<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which has produced and distributed hundreds of animated short films that advance the medium of animation. Historically, it has helped develop and refine forms of animation such as drawn-on-film animation, pinscreen animation, computer animation, and sand animation. Important directors such as Norman McLaren, Caroline Leaf, and Ryan Larkin have been employed by the Board.
</li><li> For some strange reason, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IsleOfDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IsleOfDogs">Isle of Dogs</a></em> was treated this way by some movie theater chains such as Regal, which either ran the trailer before kids' movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ferdinand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ferdinand">Ferdinand</a></em>, had trailers for kids' movies run before it (Regal showed the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrinch2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrinch2018">The Grinch</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShowDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShowDogs">Show Dogs</a></em> on their prints of the film), or did both things, despite the film not being what one would consider a kids' movie. Ironically, this may have actually <em>helped</em> the movie in the long run, since it gave the movie more exposure and resulted in it being a minor box-office success. The same "kids' trailers on an animated movie aimed at older audience" also happens to Funimation's anime films, including the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> films and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em>, despite being aimed at teenagers, likely due to the ratings shift that created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating">Avoid the Dreaded G Rating</a> trope.

POW! Comics aren't just for kids anymore!". It should be noted that that was a real news headline about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">a Batman comic</a>. Speaking of <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em>, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> users have called it a "kiddie movie" for the sole fact that it has flashy visuals and pee jokes.

</li><li> Despite the Oasis scenes which take up 75% of the movie being animated via motion capture, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne">Ready Player One</a></em> is marketed as an entirely live-action movie.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue</a>, this trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> by <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher">Joel</a> [Schumacher] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take,</em> 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. <em>It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film."</em>.

</li><li> In some parts of Latin America, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> was not only dubbed, but released with the equivalent of a PG-13 rating.

</li><li> In general, there's still a condescending attitude regarding many superhero films. The above-mentioned <em>The Dark Knight</em> received critical acclaim, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">lot of the positive reviews called it</a> "A superhero movie <em>for adults</em>" and other things along those lines.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThankYouForSmoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThankYouForSmoking">Thank You for Smoking</a></em> a conversation is shown in which the president of that time was saying that the cigarette industry now wants to manipulate children by showing them cartoons with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingIsCool">Smoking Is Cool</a> message.

<div class="indent">As is often the case with the recent Disney remakes, this one seems to adhere to the same misconception that affects the rest of the film industry, particularly where science fiction adventures, superhero narratives, and fairy tales are concerned: that if its animated, i.e. a cartoon, its somehow not a real movie, and thus not worthy of the automatic respect bestowed upon the most expensive and heavily promoted motion pictures, and not as validating to the people whove paid to see it. All of which is also strange, considering how CGI-dependent these sorts of movies are, even when theyre trying to make the mountains and buildings and tigers and parakeets made of ones and zeroes look as real as possible.
</div></li><li> Somewhat tellingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing2019">The Lion King (2019)</a></em> is treated as a live-action remake by Disney and referred to as such in its promotional materials, despite being every bit as animated as the original feature (to the point TV Tropes itself files it under the Western Animation namespace). Real animals can't exactly talk, after all. The idea seems to be that the photorealistic CG of the remake is somehow easier to take seriously than the traditional animation of the original film, despite the 1994 movie being renowned as one of Disney's most emotionally complex stories.

<ul><li> Puppets in general suffer from this trope even <em>more</em> than animation. The success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> ensured that puppet shows would generally be viewed as a medium for very young children, despite the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonuses</a>. This trope was in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a>'s reason for making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>, as he didn't want to be viewed as a children's performer; however, due to this very trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a> themselves have been fluctuating between catering to children and families/adults. Nowadays, most puppet shows, on television or otherwise, are aimed at the preschool crowd. The <em>Muppet Show</em> Muppets are currently the only truly "mainstream" puppets that cater to adults as much as children. Truly adult-oriented puppet shows, when they do exist, are almost inevitably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedKidsShow">parodies of children's entertainment</a>, whether for comedy (as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AvenueQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AvenueQ">Avenue Q</a></em>) or for horror (as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadSilence">Dead Silence</a></em>).
<ul><li> Muppets appearing on <em>Sesame Street</em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a> in and of itself, since they had been regulars on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em> and other big prime time shows. As a matter of fact, the puppets that evolved into Grover and Cookie Monster made their earliest appearances on Sullivan's show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDarkCrystalAgeOfResistance">The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</a></em> has received glowing praise across the board, especially its storytelling. Some very few critics found it "too gross / too scary for children" (similarly to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">1982 film</a>) as if it was solely intended for them, which it clearly isn't.

It is aimed at adults and has a cast made up mainly of puppets, but the humor in it comes from the mockery of old sci-fi movies, not the mere presence of the puppets themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> This attitude is averted in Taiwan, where one of the most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wuxia">Wuxia</a> franchises is <em>Pili</em>, a long-running puppetry series with as much complexity and depth as any live-action or novel.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Foreword: When dealing with video games, it should be noted that here we are dealing with an aversion and perhaps even with an inversion. Once consoles that were able to feature live-action scenes such as the Philips CD-i and the 3DO came out with commercials saying that the consoles could program Live-Action, many were at first calling this "The future of gaming", even though the consoles they were on had a high price and few bought them. While the technology was new and exciting at first, it quickly delved into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a> territory because their gameplay was usually very limited, and that the voice acting was horrible. This, coupled with the huge budget needed to make such a game (<em>Ground Zero Texas</em>, a Live-Action game on the Sega CD, cost 2 million dollars to make) and poor reviews (the aforementioned <em>Ground Zero Texas</em> got a score of 20% on Sega16), led quickly to the death of the genre. Nowadays, admitting to wanting live-action in a video game is like saying that you want your game to be horrible. This still does not prevent the medium from having its own age ghettoes, as seen below.
</li><li> Console gaming in general was this. Back when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> was released, with success, there was a clear distinct line between gamers who played on computers (who were the adults) and people who played on the NES (who were the kids). Perhaps this is one of the reasons for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> of America's strict guideline policy before the ESRB rating system. The Japanese version of the NES was even called the <em>Family</em> Computer, and Famicom games generally typically targeted younger, less literate players than games made for Japanese home computers such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX">MSX</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA">SEGA</a> noticed this trend and took it to its advantage when putting the Genesis on the shelves in America (think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Genesis Does What Nintendon't</a>). It had as a consequence that Nintendo became labeled as a kiddy brand and SEGA as the brand that manly people play.
</li><li> What contributed to Nintendo's "kiddy" image in Western territories was Nintendo forcing 3rd party developers to censor graphic/mature content themselves if they wanted their games on Nintendo's consoles. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1">Mortal Kombat</a></em> was the more infamous example where the SNES version replaced the blood with sweat(?) and severely toned down the fatalities. Nintendo has more or less dropped their stance on censoring games over time, but a lot of people to this day still believe that Nintendo only makes games for children and act completely shocked whenever a mature rated game from a third party company is released on a Nintendo console.
<ul><li> This is slowly shifting as of the release of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a></em>, which emphasises a more teen audience in its marketing compared to the heavily "fun for all the family" marketing of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a></em> and the much less successful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a></em>, as well as one of the big third parties committing to the platform being Bethesda, a publisher well-known for "mature, hard-core" violent titles, with games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheNewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheNewOrder">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a></em> (and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinIITheNewColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinIITheNewColossus">sequel</a>), and Nintendo basically having <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em> as a console-exclusive franchise at this point. It's difficult to argue that Nintendo is kid-focused at this point when it's actively courting games and developers of all stripes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> If a game is rated "E," "E10+," or sometimes even "T" (in other words, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a>), expect this to happen — you'd be surprised how much of this "Filthy Casual" hatred can actually be described as Animation Age Ghetto. You'd be more surprised at how many of the people doing this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">aren't even old enough to play T-Rated games</a>.
<ul><li> Averted in Germany, where the USK rating system is taken so seriously, that younger people who want to play 18+ (or 16+, 14+ and 12+, for that matter) rated games need to show their identity card if they want to buy a game to show that they are adult, unless they're accompanied by one. Guess that kids didn't want to get through this tedious and annoying process, which explains why in that country, that problem is almost non-existent.
</li><li> The United States did the same for M-rated games, requiring an adult's ID card to purchase such a game. This ultimately did not work as well as hoped: Teenagers who wanted these games resorted to fake ID cards (which are VERY common in the United States), and more relevantly, children who couldn't pass themselves off for adults asked their clueless parents to go buy the game for them. These parents treat video games as simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">a babysitter to plop their kids down in front of and keep them occupied and out of their hair for the day</a>, and will either assume they don't need to pay attention to what their kids are playing because "video games are for kids" and therefore couldn't <em>possibly</em> contain any kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">Harmful to Minors</a> content (and if they ever find out, expect them to flip a switch and turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> on par with Jack Thompson himself, screaming "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">How dare they sell this game to kids!</a>"), or be fully aware of said content from the get-go and just not give a shit. Thus, they would continue to buy M-rated games for their kids repeatedly.
</li><li> Now that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DigitalDistribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DigitalDistribution">Digital Distribution</a> has come online, it has become even harder to verify consumers' ages; the biggest hurdle they'd probably have to pass is a screen that says "Enter birth date here", which can be easily falsified. This has been mitigated by console and distribution software creators adding parental control options for online game purchases and access, but, again, many parents ignore these.
</li><li> This can also apply to any game that <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a>, but doesn't have sufficiently "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">realistic</a>" graphics to satisfy the discerning tastes of the 12-year-old who wants to show off how mature and grown-up he is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot">saying big boy words over the microphone</a>. Not convinced? Just ask <em>Overstrike</em>. Oh wait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fuse">you can't</a>.
</li><li> When Xbox Avatars (a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Miis</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a>) were first introduced, there was much complaining from the "won't play anything not rated M" crowd, claiming that their mature gaming machine was ruined by the presence of cartoon people, and that having to look at them before playing a serious, mature deathmatch was too much of a mood killer.
</li></ul></li><li> Media hatred is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>. In Spain, it has concentrated into video game hate... with similar arguments to the ones displayed in this trope. One would think they simply erased every mention of "cartoon" and replaced it with "videogame" in their declarations. Sigh.
</li><li> A large number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> games tend to be admonished by reviewers for their cutesy presentation, overlooking how complex or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">downright terrifying</a> they can be later on, much to the chagrin of fans.
</li><li> The entire justification by Michael Atkinson for why Australia didn't have an R rating available for video games until late 2012, despite the very vocal objections of the hundreds of thousands of mature gamers in Australia.
</li><li> RPPGs (<em>especially</em> JRPGs) get this a lot. Many of them are purposely made to go around the "T" rating specifically because, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">contrary to popular belief</a>, that's actually the <em>widest</em> range of marketability for games, but unfortunately, because of the beliefs from the Animation Age Ghetto, many people dismiss those "Animu" RPGs as being kiddy, especially because they're <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a>. Never mind how many of these "kiddy" looking games are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a> based games - and it's <em>not</em> making an effort to hide how crappy the world is. Popular WRPG games are not as subjected to this, although you'll find that developers tend to emphasize their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> parts at times to avoid this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> for instance, proudly admits it is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy">Dark Fantasy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role-Playing Game</a>".
<ul><li> This even happened with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series. Part of the reason some people actually <em>paid attention</em> to <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> was because they were rated "M". Course, the "M" rating didn't stop people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">seeing the use of primary colors in the graphics and then dismissing it as another kiddy RPG from Japan</a> - never mind the fact the former heavily involves <em>repeated simulated suicide</em> and the latter is a whodunit with heavy psychological themes, especially with regards to sexuality<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3djdx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3djdx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3djdx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">particularly with regards to Kanji, whose dungeon is the product of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">confusion about his sexual orientation</a>, and Rise, whose dungeon is a demonic stripclub</span>.

</li><li> The <em>Tales</em> series may suffer from this. Especially <em>Symphonia</em>, <em>Abyss</em>, and <em>Vesperia</em>. So, we have subjects like racial discrimination, vigilante murder or even accidentally killing an entire town full of people <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> both of these were actually committed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a></em> of all people</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a> being thrown around from every angle... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Perfectly suitable for children who are under the age of twelve</a>. In addition, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> relies a lot on deconstructing a lot of cliches.

It takes an adult watching some scenes to notice some of these themes...or actually be familiar with the cliches being deconstructed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> gets this from some quarters, mainly due to its very cartoony art style. Of course, aside from how nobody younger than high-school age is going to get the umptillion references to Gnosticism that form the basis for the setting...one of the major supporting characters (who briefly joins the party) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">is addicted to the neural tissue of bioroids</a></em>. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gets gunned down by one of his allies, merely because it's not her job to keep <em>him</em>, personally, alive</span>. You know, for kids!
<ul><li> That is in the first five hours (tops) of the game. By the <em>end</em> of the game, there is the infamous "Ma belle peche" scene, wherein a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">very</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">scary</a> villain intimidates into submission and then "hacks" one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a> (who is also an endearing party member most players have at least some fondness for) in what amounts to an onscreen, compellingly-acted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">metaphor for child rape</a></em>. How this game managed to avoid the M rating it so richly deserved is a mystery for the ages.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> is one of the biggest sufferers of this trope outside of America, mostly because the entire franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">headlined by the anime</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4t5vm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4t5vm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4t5vm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with any minimal shred of adult themes, read: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em>, edited away by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a></span>, <em>was</em> strictly for children in its early days. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> grew, they became increasingly aware of the "<em>Pokémon</em> is for kids" stigma. As such, Game Freak has made a conscious effort to abolish the Ghetto by establishing <em>Pokémon</em> as a hipster-friendly all-ages franchise, and by downplaying the role of the anime, essentially the only part of the franchise that still abides by the Ghetto itself.
</li></ul></li><li> It's probably worth mentioning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>. The game uses highly stylized art reminiscent of a Pixar film which, coupled with bright colors, apparently makes it look "cartoony". This is contrasted by large amounts of blood, players gibbing upon explosion, and a mild level of swearing. You can occasionally run into 7 or 8-year-old kids online whose parents obviously didn't pay attention to the rating. Speaking of online, as a multiplayer game with voice and text chat, it's very common to hear even more inappropriate language than what was originally put in the game—there's a reason the ESRB warnings state that "online interactions are not rated".
<ul><li> And in some of the "Meet the Team" shorts, there are even more intense depictions of violence than in-game (such as BLU Spy's head exploding in graphic detail, and BLU Soldier having a hole blown through his chest). In addition, there's the scene in "Meet the Spy" where we see suggestive photos of RED Spy and Scout's mother and, hell, just about all of "Meet the Pyro".
</li></ul></li><li> A more specific example is the presence of Sprite graphics in games today (With the exception of downloadable games), which are dismissed by review sites as dated and rarely taken as seriously as 3D models.
</li><li> If <em>any</em> game uses <em>any</em> form of stylized graphics, expect people to dismiss it as being "kiddy". Heck, people have even criticized <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>'s graphics for looking like something out of a Disney Movie, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> were criticized for not being "Dark" enough. All because Blizzard doesn't believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a>...and there's a great deal of horror in both franchises.
<ul><li> When it comes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>...complaining about the game not being "Dark" enough when the trailer featured a barbarian being ripped in half. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">totally for children</a>.
</li><li> The most common complaint about the <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, <em>Mists Of Pandaria</em> is the fact that the areas are brightly colored and features a lot of talking animals, starring the talking pandas, the Pandarens. Many people even took one look at the Pandarens and jumped headlong into the idea that Blizzard ripped off the concept of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> (despite the Pandaren being introduced in <em>Warcraft 3</em>, which was released years before the first <em>Kung-Fu Panda</em> movie). This despite the fact that the expansion is not too much lighter in terms of story than the others.
</li></ul></li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> fits this trope, the game WAS originally being marketed at children, particularly when it was ported to home consoles in 1993. This was one of only a handful of instances where the censors actually had a valid point on the matter.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VivaPinata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VivaPinata">Viva Piñata</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>, Microsoft wanted the game to be its answer to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, but it didn't work out. Why? Well, the game <em>looked</em> like a children's game but actually comprised challenging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> sim management tasks that kids, and even some adults, just couldn't handle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> got hit by this because, and <em>only</em> because, the game featured brightly colored textures, a cel-shaded lighting system, characters with cartoony proportions, and cartoony slapstick humor, thus even some of the most die-hard Zelda fans hated on this game. Common criticisms included "This game is for kids only!" the sole reason that the game was cel-shaded. One fan reviewer even called it "C-quality Disney garbage," even though said "Disney garbage" is actually considered to be some of the greatest animation of all time, and along with classic Japanese animation, almost certainly contributed to the development of the art style. The game's detractors didn't notice the dark backstory (which involves the gods having to flood the world to prevent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Ganondorf, from taking it over, because the hero of legend is no longer around, with Ganondorf being left unchecked to wreak havoc upon the world otherwise) or the infamously violent ending (which involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ganondorf's head being impaled with the Master Sword</span>). After the game received immense critical praise both in Japan and in America, gamers gradually warmed up to the game, and today it is considered a modern classic.
</li><li> A few years later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> was announced, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a> aesthetic that was the opposite of <em>Wind Waker</em>. As such, the game completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> this trope and was hyped much more heavily pre-release than <em>Wind Waker</em>, with many people believing that it would be the greatest video game of all time. The game ended up with the same sort of immense critical praise that <em>Wind Waker</em> got, but is slightly less liked by the fanbase, with some fans criticizing the graphics as "dull" and "gritty". This shows that two games of roughly the same quality can elicit very different audience reactions if one of them suffers from this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series. While the games are largely family-friendly, they bring together a stable of Nintendo and other game characters representing all sorts of different aesthetics and demographics, and seem to not prioritize any specific age group over others. Despite this, every other fan and gaming journalist is quick to label the series as a "children's series", largely because many of the constituent series - such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, the most prominently-represented and the franchise's namesake - are cartoonish family-friendly series that themselves suffer from a reputation of being "for children". The more colorful artstyle of the fourth game ended up invoking this trope even further. This is despite one of the characters featured being freaking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em>.
</li><li> The initial divisive reaction to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em> was colored by this trope. Since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> was Nintendo's first high-definition consoles, fans were eager to see how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a> would do with a high-definition entry in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> series, one of Nintendo's first few first-party franchises agreed to be "mature". The announcement that they were working on a colorful 2D platformer game was seen by many as a waste of Retro Studios' talents, particularly since the genre was well-served by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends">games</a> on the system. <em>Tropical Freeze</em> would come to be seen as one of the best 2D platformers ever made, but mostly in retrospect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series regularly struggles with this trope. The games are cartoony, family-friendly, and made to appeal to as wide a demographic as possible. As such, the series often gets slapped with the "kiddy" label despite the creators' intentions. <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102165451/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/111028qa/03.html">According to the late Satoru Iwata<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the perception of <em>Mario</em> as a "childish" franchise was a problem that Nintendo wasn't too pleased about, and they actively worked on having the franchise appeal to all age groups.
</li><li> One of the composers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em> was hit with this trope when he composed music for the game with a "cute" and "kid-friendly" feel, based on his impressions of Mario and his series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KojiKondo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KojiKondo">Koji Kondo</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Super-Mario-Galaxy/Volume-3-The-Sound-Team/2-A-Sound-That-Defines-Mario/2-A-Sound-That-Defines-Mario-205066.html">rejected the music<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, asserting that "Mario is cool" and that <em>Mario</em> games are "cool adventure games" at their core. Kondo himself never viewed the character as "cute", and kept this in mind when composing music for the series through the years.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope has been the bane of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> franchise for many years now. Ironically, Sonic was seen as an <em>aversion</em> in his conception, because Sega marketed the character as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotWithAttitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotWithAttitude">hip and cool</a>" alternative to the "Kid friendly" Mario. But after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, the series began to delve into deeper and more intricate storylines with...questionable quality, that by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> rolled around, the public perception of Sonic was that the series shouldn't be serious at all because it stars a cartoon blue hedgehog and Sega took that to heart, as every game after the aforementioned Sonic 06 have become increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> much to frustration of parts of the fanbase who preferred the more intricate storylines. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em> saw a return to the darker storylines of old, so time will tell if Sega is reversing this trend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> fans are very familiar with this trope. As a colorful, family-friendly series loaded with adorable, cartoony character designs in a genre dominated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a> gorefests aimed at teenagers and adults, it attracts a lot of bile for being "immature" and "for kids" and is generally not taken as seriously as its contemporaries. This sentiment tends to greatly annoy the <em>Splatoon</em> fanbase, as both games go out of their way to appeal to players of all ages with their addicting gameplay and surprisingly deep characters—not to mention a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy">Surprise Creepy</a> almost on par with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>.
</li><li> This happened with the initial wave of 3D M-rated games that came out during the advent of the fifth generation of games (which began in either 1995 or 1996 depending on where you lived). One particular example is the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em>, which was, in fact, one of the very first M-rated games - after all, it's not easy to forget the violence, cannibalism via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">zombies and other undead critters</a>, scientific exploitation, betrayal, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">gripping, horrifying death scenes</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">Kenneth anyone?</a>). To top it all off, the main characters are an elite SWAT-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> team. Alas, the thought that games were a form of "children's entertainment" was firmly stuck into marketers' and parents' heads, which resulted in a good deal of eight year olds buying the game. This is ironic in hindsight, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatterhouse">far</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterParty">more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">violent</a> games had been released during the 8 and 16-bit eras, and while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> came after a few of them, namely <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, many violent games escaped the parental radar, mostly because a lot of them were either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> or released on less mainstream gaming systems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>. It has cute squirrels on the box, and it has lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">Toilet Humour</a>. Perfect game for kids, right? Nope. There's lots of sexual content, swearing, blood/gore, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">an opera-singing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingPoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingPoo">turd</a>. And yet, there were still quite a few small children who ended up playing it, despite the huge disclaimers on the cover stating it wasn't for children, placed there because it was anticipated people would mistake it for a kids' game.
</li><li> While gaming is seen as perfectly normal for adults these days, hardcore gaming is still seen as "immature." This belief might stem from the fact that kids, teens and college students generally have more free time to spend on hardcore games than people with kids, mortgages and jobs do, which is why the latter tend to play casual games.
</li><li> Part of the reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em> sold so poorly, was due to the general public passing it off as a "kiddie" game due to its cute appearance. While the game <em>is</em> somewhat family-friendly, it has quite a bit of dark content, especially later into the story.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note518wx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note518wx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note518wx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That, and the fact that it was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> and received little-to-no advertising from Nintendo didn't help matters...</span>
</li><li> The Commodore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST">Atari ST</a> were never really taken seriously by mainstream business computer users in the U.S. because of their association with gaming, barring creative people like artists and musicians.
</li><li> At the height of the moral panic over video game violence in the '90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> founder Ken Williams repeatedly pointed out that most of the people who bought and played games were adults. The company was no stranger to controversy with adult-oriented games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry">Leisure Suit Larry</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phantasmagoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phantasmagoria">Phantasmagoria</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has vivid colors that make locales and characters pop out, which caused a lot of people to dismiss it as a childish MMORPG or trying to copy off the art style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. Look past the bright colors and you got a <em>very</em> dark game that is not afraid to openly show you just how grim the world is (post <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> recovery, genocide, conquering lands and converting its people to the side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, etc). Other grim themes that are more subdued or subtle are acknowledged in game as well, such as slavery, prostitution, and racism. Even the Lalafell race, which look like a race of children, can exhibit <em>very</em> adult behavior and some even use their childish looks to exploit people.
</li><li> Take a sip every time an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">r/entitledparents</a> story involving video game consoles, particularly handheld ones, being stolen, or an attempt thereof being made, includes the entitled parent claiming the rightful owner is too old to own this expensive electronic device because it only exists to play video games. Take another sip when the game the rightful owner was playing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">completely inappropriate for children</a>. Actually, maybe just take a sip for the latter, or just don't use an alcoholic drink, else you'll probably poison yourself. There has been <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/av1y47/hey_you_are_too_old_for_a_pc/">one story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where an EP claimed the 15-year-old submitter was too old to own <em>a computer</em>, because apparently personal computers can't run <em>anything</em> other than video games.

Towards the climax of the video, DW wants to go to her friends' birthday party at the movie theater.

The "grounded" videos are frequently made by those kids, often having <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em> characters in them... but since those shows are made for <em>younger</em> kids, the video makers turn the protagonists into brats and put them through all kinds of horrifying mishaps because "baby shows" are inherently bad to them and need to be punished.

<div class="indent"> Though our original story was good, and we loved mixing our simplistic shape-based art with a mature story line, we found it nearly impossible to pitch this concept to any animation studio.

<div class="indent"><strong>Neil Emmett</strong>: The site prides itself on covering as broad a range of fiction as possible, emerging as a sometimes fascinating form of populist, open-access media scholarship.

TV Tropes has a page devoted to what it calls the Animation Age Ghetto, which gives a reasonable if scattershot overview of the subject. The page's "examples" section, however, consists in large part of people filibustering about how their favorite superhero cartoons never caught on. The main reason that most of these cartoons never attracted adult audiences, of course, is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">they are simply not for adults</a>. That's not to say that there's anything wrong with having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure">guilty pleasures</a>. The humorist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a> summed things up well: a fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, he commented that "every now and again we all like a chicken nugget." As he continued, however, "If you are an adult you want something surprising, savory, sharp, unusual, cosmopolitan, alien, challenging, complex, ambiguous, possibly even slightly disturbing and wrong. You want to try those things, because that's what being adult means." The ever-enthusiastic geek demographic certainly does not see animation as being merely for children. But it suffers from an inverted snobbery, with more inventive or experimental animation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">dismissed as "pretentious" or "arthouse"</a>, and from a view of the medium that is built largely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">nostalgia for beloved childhood cartoons</a>. Even dedicated animation enthusiasts can overlook much of the best work which is out there: perhaps it is in human nature for audiences to stick to the films which they think they might enjoy rather than try anything new.

</li><li> This list of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.enkivillage.com/disturbing-cartoons.html">10 Most Disturbing Cartoons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an inversion of this trope. It does acknowledge that cartoons can appeal to adults and warns explicitly to not let your kids see them. What qualifies it as an inversion though is that it lists children cartoons such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> that, according to the logic of this article, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">can not appeal to children</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">they have disturbing content</a>.

</li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> response to an article about mature cartoons inverts the trope, saying that cartoons are made "by, for, and starring adults" and that kids were only "welcome" to watch. The <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/optimusscotto/status/1089719818679242753">article itself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> played it straight, lumping in all-ages fare like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CarmenSandiego">Carmen Sandiego</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderVerse">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a></em> with adult works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> and <em>Love, Death &amp; Robots</em> with the argument that kids aren't the target <em>because</em> it's mature.
</li><li> This trope is part of the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">What Do You Mean, It's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">(Not)</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">for Kids?</a> pages in the first place, since people will be surprised if a mature or violent animated series is aimed at kids, and if a risque animated series isn't. The trope name is also invoked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei">Iyashikei</a> and teen or adult-focused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment">Edutainment</a> without any objectionable content, under the pretense that anything nonviolent or educational <em>has</em> to be for kids and that adults wouldn't appreciate it.

Because he hadn't yet developed the ability to discern quality, which this trope relies on, he internalized his experiences in playing the game, blaming <em>himself</em> — rather than the game — for being unable to play it. The lack of a developed taste didn't prevent him from having an unsatisfactory experience with the game, and in fact may have made it worse, since he wasn't able to rationalize that it was simply a bad game. When applied to the animation industry, one could see how this trope lingered for so long (and continues to in some parts of the world): while children may be willing to watch bad cartoons, their experiences with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">would likely make them dismissive of animation as they become older</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">which in turn will lead to children being the only audience of future cartoons</a>.

Even a cursory glance at the actual animation shows that this is aimed at adults, and there is a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode to drill it in further in case you don't get it. That said, many of the show's morals, like acceptance of who you are, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">conversion therapy</a> is ineffectual at best and torture at worst, and that beauty doesn't matter, should in fact be taught to children, and some of the staff members have isolated those scenes on YouTube.

He expressed his sentiments in a letter to one of his animators, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShamusCulhane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShamusCulhane">Shamus Culhane</a>, who recalled this in his biography:
<div class="indent"><em>"During the span of years from 1914, I have made efforts to retain the 'cartoony" effect. That is, I did not welcome the trend of the industry to go "arty". It was, and still is, my opinion that a cartoon should represent, in simple form, the cartoonist's mental expression. In other words the "animated oil painting" has taken the place of the flashiness and delightfulness of the simple cartoon. In my opinion, the industry must pull back. Pull away from the tendencies toward realism. It must stay in its own backyard of "The Cartoonist's Cartoon.". The cartoon must be a portrayal of the expression of the true cartoonist, in simple,unhampered cartoon style. The true cartoon is a great art in its own right. It does not need the assistance or support of "Artiness." In fact, it is actually hampered by it."</em>
</div></li><li> Despite the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> DVDs having a <strong>warning</strong> on the DVD cases that they may not be appropriate for younger viewers (due to the outdated references and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">racial stereotypes</a> that often get edited when aired on television), it still doesn't stop stores from placing them in the kids section.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> jumps to mind. Running from 1993 to 1995, It was among the earlier western attempts at breaking the ghetto, and, in spite of the many problems that popped up because of that, the series went on to become a hit and garnered high ratings, and the creators even concluded a Kickstarter campaign to bring the show back.
<ul><li> From the same period, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Exosquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Exosquad">Exosquad</a></em>, which was set in the future where humanity is fighting essentially "World War II in space with giant robo-suits". The show had complex plots, characters that got killed, and using the Terran-Neosapien conflict for un-preachy lessons about racism and the horrors of war. It got cancelled too, but not because of content—despite the clout and muscle of Universal Studios backing it, it often got shafted by local stations (it was syndicated) to crappy timeslots like 4AM.
</li></ul></li><li> Though how it happened is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">let's just say sad</a>, it's also amusing that the only animated shows on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> that survive are comedies for the older crowd.
</li><li> In Italy, if it's cartoon art, then it <em>must</em> be targeted to children, bloody battles, dismemberment and sexual innuendo notwithstanding. Which is weird, considering how established the Italian market for adult comic books is.
</li><li> The censor board from France, before the 1990s, just automatically flagged animation for kids without even watching a single episode. To this day, we still don't know why.
<ul><li> Probably in part because France has the same baffling problem as Italy, above. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics">Franco-Belgian Comics</a> have pretty much always had large segments intended solely for adults, the <em>cartoon series</em> they make are almost universally children- or family-oriented even to this day (which led to some problems in the early days of the 90's anime craze, which is probably why they changed their tunes).
</li><li> Then again, it is the French censor board. The same censor board that thinks that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em> is 12+ worthy and that did not have an 18+ rating prior to the release of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BaiseMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BaiseMoi">Baise Moi</a> (the latter of which is redlinked due to not fitting the 5P standards on This Very Wiki ). It is ultra-rare for animation in general to be worse and what is worse is quite often not released in France to begin with.
<ul><li> The French Censor Board already had an X-rating before, of course. A 18+ rating is the equivalent of an American NC-17 (but much more rarely given ; most NC-17 films are rated 16+ only in France).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Thus far, there have been only a handful of attempts (not counting streaming series) by American studios to produce adult animated dramas, and the vast majority of them have been unsuccessful.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> was the first such series, and lasted for three seasons, but only had sixteen episodes— and six of those were five-minute shorts. It did, however, gain a live-action movie spinoff.
</li><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvasionAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvasionAmerica">Invasion America</a></em> folded after one season without any plot resolution. It's worth noting that the reason <em>Invasion America</em> aired in primetime in the first place was because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>; It was intended to air on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB">Kids' WB!</a>, but was seen as too dark, so the network burned it off on primetime instead and didn't renew it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn">Spawn</a></em> lasted a full three seasons, and managed to wrap up its main story arc, but still ended on a cliffhanger that has was never truly resolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheNewAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheNewAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</a></em>, like <em>Invasion America</em>, only lasted a single season of 13 episodes before being unceremoniously cancelled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Primal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Primal">Primal</a></em>, unlike the previous series, was only ever intended to be a miniseries with 10 episodes (though it was renewed for a second season).
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> was released, critics praised the mature storytelling and vibrant art style, saying it was "wasted on weekday afternoons." They thought it could easily grab the attention of a more adult audience. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> put this to the test, giving the show a prime-time slot, it flopped miserably.
<ul><li> This was likely due to the show being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreTurningPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreTurningPoint">a forerunner for more adult-targeted animation</a>. Being one of the first, besides <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, it helped to break the public perception of cartoons as being only for kids and paved the way for other shows. Anime had a similar transition that took at least a decade before it started appearing more prevalently on television.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceTimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceTimm">Bruce Timm</a> and his co-producers have commented many times in interviews and on DVD commentaries that they very much doubted they would be allowed to get away with some of the things they did in the "Timmverse" if they tried them today. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">The other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">installments</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">in the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DCAU</a> have received similar praise.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a>, while the show itself wasn't an example, the original pitch from the network specifically requested a "Batman in Highschool" series. The creators, being forced to make the show, decided to make it dark and adult, in response.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> is a continuation of the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> at the helm, scripts by many of the same writers, and the original cast (except Walter Koenig) providing voicework. It aired in the 1970s on Saturday morning — anything not kid-friendly in those slots was literally forbidden back then. The show was presented as a direct sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> and took itself just as seriously as the original, with no concessions to its possibly younger audience. Stories included an episode about religious intolerance titled "Jihad", and another in which Nurse Chapel gets a whiff of Harry Mudd's love drug and tries to jump Spock's bones (or at least as close to it as TV would allow back then). It was well received enough to earn the franchise's first Emmy Award. This is remarkable when one considers that the company that made it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation">Filmation</a>, to at least some extent actively encouraged the Animation Age Ghetto, as they felt it their civic duty to act as agents of social uplift for the kids, and not to scare or puzzle them too much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> was directed toward teenagers, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">the animated series</a> was aimed at kids. Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a> shows, <em>Teen Titans</em> still managed to strike a balance between standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaturdayMorningCartoon">Saturday Morning Cartoon</a> fare and more mature storytelling.
<ul><li> At one point in time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, which was spun-out of a series of shorts based on the original series and which falls into the ghetto more than said series, was one of the most-watched shows amongst kids 2-5, having ratings on par with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PawPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PawPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em>. It has an attractive artstyle with super-deformed characters, bright colors, catchy songs and often airs during the early morning hours when toddlers would usually watch TV. Despite all of this, it's officially rated TV-PG and has some scary scenes, references to things the target demographic might be too young for (for example, there were entire episodes based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakfastClub">The Breakfast Club</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em>), some hidden innuendos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">episodes that only make sense to people who watched the original series</a>, and most infamously of all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">morals "encouraging" bad behavior</a>.
<ul><li> In the late 2010s, former CN president Christina Miller was frequently accused by fans of enforcing this trope. Cartoon Network's programming had come to strictly emphasize comedies aimed towards younger children and heavily downplayed any content for teens and young adults. Many of these accusations, however, are exaggerated at best or outright unfounded at worst, and are simply the result of Miller being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Scapegoat Creator</a>. While network itself would begin abandoning TV-PG programming to some extent during her tenure, it was alongside the beginning of the animation studio's targeted expansion into creating adult animation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> (and, later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a>) with shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackDynamite">Black Dynamite</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Primal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Primal">Primal</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough">Close Enough</a></em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, while having little to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice">its namesake comic</a>, has a much more mature feel. Real guns are frequently used (although lasers are also shown), there are fairly complex running storylines, innuendo-laced jokes are made, characters are killed, and there are also allusions to real world political situations such as in North Korea and the Middle East (albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">obvious stand-ins</a>). It's made all the more baffling since the series was aired on Saturday mornings rather than a prime time slot, where more adult-oriented content like <em>The Clone Wars</em> was usually placed on Cartoon Network (though <em>Clone Wars</em> would eventually see itself on Saturday mornings as well).
</li><li> A similar occurrence took place to a <em>much</em> greater extent, especially in the later seasons, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Static" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Static">The Milestone Comic on which it is based</a> can be best described as an <em>Amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> with a black hero, twice as much angst, and 10 times more contemporary content (sex, gay-bashing and visual gang warfare were but a few of the series's recurring focal points). While early seasons of the animated series is close <em>enough</em> to its source material, it became more and more child-oriented as time went on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">Family-Friendly Firearms</a> was in full effect by the middle of the series even though the use of real guns were a major catalyst in the series' premiere, as well as an episode addressing school shootings wherein Richie gets shot in the leg (though no blood was shown).
</li><li> Since the creators believed that WB would not go for a dark animated series, the original pitch for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> tone with a modified version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> acting as kid sidekicks to the JLA. When the show was instead picked up by Cartoon Network, the sidekicks were ditched and the show's tone was made closer to that of the earlier DCAU cartoons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceTimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceTimm">Bruce Timm</a> has gone on record stating that he's relieved the original idea never came to fruition.
</li><li> Subversion: the UK — specifically, Channel 4 — has exhibited a hefty amount of adult animation for TV.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> reran on The N during the mid-2000s, which at first shared space with preschool channel Noggin before eventually splitting into the separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick">TeenNick</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr">Nick Jr.</a> channels, respectively. Episodes shown on The N were frequently censored to remove any references to things like sex, drinking, or other "mature" content to edit it down to a TV-PG rating. This is in contrast to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em>, a teen drama and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">The N's most popular show</a>, which kept its own TV-14 rating (though it did have its own issues with censorship as well).
</li><li> Sky One used to air <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BabyBlues">Baby Blues</a></em> as part of their Saturday Morning line-up, along with kids stuff in the early part of the decade. They, uh, did not last long. Though in the latter's case, the comic strip it adapted <em>was</em> family-friendly.
<ul><li> In-universe example: Brian once told on Adam West for watching cartoons because he was an adult.
</li></ul></li><li> Fox used to air <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends">The Ripping Friends</a></em>, which before used to air on Spike TV when they attempted to make a block for adult animation (which got cancelled after a month), on Saturday morning. It is basically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> on steroids (it <em>is</em> created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>...). Cancellation and a spot on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> at 11:00 PM ensued. Guess they figured adults would appreciate all the poop and booger jokes more.
<ul><li> <em>Ren &amp; Stimpy</em> (particularly <em>Adult Party Cartoon</em>) got hit quite hard. Notably, the latter was <em>intended</em> to be as disturbing and inappropriate for children as humanly possible, but somehow ended up briefly getting a <em>Y7/C8</em> rating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> is revered for being an animated show enjoyed by both children and adults, but in the British "100 Greatest Kids' TV shows" poll on Channel 4 (which wasn't very democratic since the 100 shows were picked by the channel in the first place; the public were simply putting them in order, so to speak) the number 1 spot was taken by <em>The Simpsons</em>. The people on the show's constant pleas that it belonged there because it appealed to all ages really held no ground considering there are plenty of other shows that kids can also enjoy despite them being made for adults that didn't make the list. Once again, it seems to be the old argument "It's animated, that means kids must like it!"
<ul><li> In Brazil, TV Channel Rede Globo decided to start airing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> at noon, right after the morning cartoon block. Not very good, but at least <em>The Simpsons</em> was acknowledged as a separate entity from the block; and the time slot could be watched by adults and teenagers. But then they changed their minds and started airing it inside the cartoon block. It's quite a shock to see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> being aired right after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em>, to say the least.
</li><li> In Colombia it's aired Saturdays 2:00 - 3:00 P.M <em>to this day</em>, severely edited. It's more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> since it seems they <em>know</em> that the show has some things not meant for children, but they do it anyway because they know adults and teenagers love it anyway and it's not bad to get more audience.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the few real exceptions to this trope on American television is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, which has always stayed out of the ghetto by focusing almost entirely on adult-oriented humor. And we don't mean "excessive raunchiness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>" Adult, we mean "the normal and instantly relatable stuff grown-ups have to deal with day-to-day" type of Adult. Kids and teens, who were at first drawn in by the "from the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em>" marketing, found the show boring and stayed away, but the adult audience kept the show running for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">13 seasons</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> deserves a mention, as Nickelodeon specifically asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez">Jhonen Vasquez</a> to make a show for older children, only for it to eventually be marketed towards the channel's usual demographic alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>. Predictably, it only lasted a season and a half due. (Ironically, Nick later extensively used it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsUnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsUnite">in cross</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsMLB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NicktoonsMLB">overs</a> meant for said other shows' target demographics).
</li><li> This may have been a factor in the demise of a proposed animated TV series based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>. The series would have supposedly been similar in tone to the movies, and aimed at audiences of the same age. Unfortunately, at the time the idea of an adult animated series that wasn't a comedy was hard to sell, even with the executive power of Steven Spielberg behind it, and the show was cancelled without ever airing an episode. Later, in 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JurassicWorldCampCretaceous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JurassicWorldCampCretaceous">another Jurassic Park animated series</a> would finally see the light of day.
<ul><li> <em>Camp Cretaceous</em> itself is worthy of mention here because, contrary to expectations before its release, it actually manages to <em>avoid</em> the Ghetto for the most part, and sticks to the same tone as the live-action movies. It's still aimed at kids, but then, the <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies themselves are also heavily merchandised towards kids despite being rated PG-13.
</li></ul></li><li> Bell TV will categorize any animated series as "Children", regardless of its rating. End result, cartoons such as those in the future with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">automated suicide booths and vending machines labeled "Refreshing! Crack"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">with frequent decapitation and dismemberment, oft-horrifying imagery, cannibalism, a severely debauched clown...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">Toki</a> are labeled as "Children".
</li><li> For a while, every movie in the DC Universe Animated line had a sticker on the case saying "The First-Ever Animated (insert subject of movie here) Movie Rated <strong>PG-13!</strong>", as if nobody would watch the movie otherwise (which, sadly, is probably the case). It technically isn't even true for <em>Batman: Gotham Knight</em>, since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyondReturnOfTheJoker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></em> was rated PG-13 eight years before.
</li><li> Some people would say that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> deserve a special mention in this case. They're aired on Boomerang and clearly marketed to young children - despite the gratuitous amounts of various types of guns, smoking, alcohol, violence, general cruelty and lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> references - things that are not passable even in modern TV-PG rated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> shows (perhaps excluding the violence). On the other hand, you can find most of those in a G-rated film (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> has Gaston carry a gun, drink beer, and literally stab the titular Beast in the back, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">An American Tail</a></em> depicts smoking). Perhaps these commentators are simply underestimating American culture's ideas about what's kid-friendly?
<ul><li> It's worth noting that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> and its many contemporaries were originally created with an <em>adult</em> audience in mind, being shorts that were run before feature films in theaters. They picked up their huge following (and association) with young audiences thanks to syndicated reruns on television starting in the 1950's.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> won a Peabody award (very unusual for a cartoon) for its character development and respect for war's consequences. However, the finale has been criticized for a perceived "immaturity" in the resolution of Aang's moral dilemma by having him rediscover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> anti-bending</span>, and not take a harsh choice. <em>However</em>, it was representative of the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">personal struggle</a>, and the creators planned this out from the beginning of the series.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">sequel series</a> has been consistently getting high views in older age groups, even managing to beat out some Prime-Time shows in viewership. Despite this, its marketed at a slightly <em>lower</em> age group than its predecessor.
</li><li> Interestingly, part way through season 3, the show was pulled from air, and only made available to watch online. While some feel that this was merely an example of continuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, many others suspect that Nickelodeon was trying to distance the show from its younger-skewing series due to it becoming increasingly dark and violent, as well as the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Korra ends the series in a relationship with another woman,</span> something virtually unheard-of in Western animation at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the source of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>. It was originally intended for a more mature audience, but was dialed back at the producers' request (necessitating a name change from the original title, "The <em>Whoopass</em> Girls"... exactly.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/ThePowerpuffGirls">Its original intent is still somewhat clear, however</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> launched an assault on the Ghetto, apart from a few specifically kid-aimed episodes.
<ul><li> When the show began airing in Hungary, it was in turn met with an assault from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> of the former National TV Authority ORTT. Its scenario followed almost step-by-step the dilemma of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> from a decade earlier — show airs on a Sunday-morning cartoon block, ORTT riots, forces the TV station to give it an R rating, TV station decides to cancel it instead. Granted, <em>The Clone Wars</em> is a very violent series that had nothing to do in that timeslot, but given that the ORTT's charges against it included <em>portraying aliens in an anthropomorphic manner</em>, it's clear that neither party was particularly right in the head. Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> later picked up the rest of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> was possibly the strangest subversion of this trope in existence. Despite the fact that its primary demographic was grade-school girls, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">original showrunner</a> did everything she could to make it enjoyable for the parents of said grade-schoolers. And thanks to a couple of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/the-end-of-the-creator-driven-era.html">blog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/09/my-little-homophobic-racist-smarts-shaming-pony/">posts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> condemning the show essentially sight unseen, it managed to catch the attention of 4Chan and later snowballed into a sub-cultural phenomenon that lasted throughout the 2010s.
<ul><li> Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a>'s intentions, though, there are people who believe that all fans of the show older than the intended young audience are creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchildren</a> simply because of the presence of ponies. There's also bronies who are highly insistent that <em>they're</em> the new primary demographic and can get rather resentful whenever the show breaks away from things like worldbuilding to focus on teaching morals or promote the toyline, even to the point of denying the idea of the show being popular with the primary demographic for whatever reason.
</li><li> Lauren Faust targeted the show at girls between 5 and 12 (as opposed to earlier incarnations of the series targeted at ages 4 to 7) and their parents, both mothers and fathers. Nickelodeon Germany premiered it one year after The Hub. But when it did, it did so right after the pre-school Nick Jr. block, back to back with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em>, and with a dub fit for the target audience of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em> which goes <em>up to</em> 5. Later, Nickelodeon Germany pushed the show <em>into</em> the Nick Jr. block where it has been residing ever since. Also, it has only ever been placed into time slots in which only pre-school kids would be able to watch it but neither its target audience nor bronies and other fans of any age. All of this despite Nickelodeon Germany getting a load of requests from bronies to run the show in the first place, which probably should have been a sign that it would work better and be accepted on a later time slot. The same "preschool show" treatment is given to the show in Canada, where it airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreehouseTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreehouseTV">Treehouse TV</a>... complete with <em>censorship</em>, mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">whenever the word "loser" is used</a> in some episodes <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6314w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6314w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6314w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(which makes some scenes seem <em>worse</em>, like Pinkie's infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">party</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnySchizophrenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnySchizophrenia">with inanimate objects</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E25PartyOfOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E25PartyOfOne">Party of One</a> - "I'm just glad none of 'em ponies showed up! They're a bunch of [BEEEP]!" "Oh, they're not... so bad." "After the way they treated you? I'd say [BEEP] isn't strong enough!")</span>. This is despite the show being rated TV-Y in America, which means the content is intended to be acceptable for <em>all</em> children.
</li><li> The show is rated TV-Y, which is the rating that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DinosaurTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DinosaurTrain">many of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterRabbit">its</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">contemporaries</a> also have, and they're very clearly marketed as preschool shows. They have one thing in common in that, even though they have a large audience appeal, TV-Y rated shows can't escape the stigma of being only for preschool kids.
</li></ul></li><li> RCN network in Colombia aired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> during morning weekends, along with things from <em>Disney</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> screamed and the show didn't survive a month.
</li><li> Again in Colombia, Caracol network used to air <em>Ranma 1/2</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> uncensored, with the announcement saying that those two shows were specifically for children. They still air <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em>, and still announce the programs as specifically for children. No one has said anything about it whatsoever.
</li><li> The creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> blame its short run on ABC on this trope. The show was the only animated series in the network's lineup, and aired on a night of family friendly comedies (an audience <em>The Critic</em> clearly was not aiming for.) The ironic result that was viewers dismissed the show as kid's fare despite it being the edgiest thing ABC showed all night. The show parodied this by ending an episode with Jay breaking the fourth wall and wishing "a special good night to all of you just tuning in to watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>!" This was followed by wacky cartoon music and an iris-out effect reminiscent of old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> shorts.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> in particular deserves mention for being one of the very few primetime animated dramas produced in the United States, and the only one to last more than one season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> is often seen as a "kids show" because it's on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>. This is often a defense of the show when Marvel fans complained about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbMissionMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbMissionMarvel">the crossover</a> and a claim made by the haters but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that the show is actually aimed at adults but doesn't exclude children as an audience.
</li><li> At least partially responsible for the brief runs of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn">Spawn</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpicyCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpicyCity">Spicy City</a></em>, which aired on HBO and were decidedly not at all child-friendly. Both were critically acclaimed (<em>Spawn</em> even won an Emmy) but received little viewership and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners">Short-Runners</a> as a result. It didn't help that the HBO Animation logo was somewhat "whimsical."
</li><li> While he does occasionally do films meant for young audiences, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton">Bill Plympton</a>'s relatively small reputation and distinct visual style have kept him out of this trope, as those familiar with his work know perfectly well that his stuff is not for kids. Nevertheless, someone felt compared to write "NOT FOR CHILDREN" in huge white letters on the poster for his 2001 feature <em>Mutant Aliens</em>, which features generous amounts of onscreen sexual intercourse, defecation and gore.
<ul><li> <em>The Tune</em> was very popular among children, mostly because it lacked his trademark political incorrectness (boasting a single, brief shot of nudity). Bill didn't seem to mind.
</li></ul></li><li> Belgium used to be a big offender of this trope until the mid-2000. The main reason why the trope stopped being in effect after that in the country is due to the national success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a>. Which is kind of odd for a country that has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics">same problems</a> as France and Italy and where all of the only available anime is shonen (although seinen and shoujo manga is available there). One Belgian animator even managed to get on a local newspaper for proposing a new adult animated comedy for <em>Comedy Central</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is a show that airs on Disney networks. Tote bags of it were once given out in Subway Kids Meals, and a few children's chapter books have been published. All this, despite the fact that the show contains unprecedented amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, violence, death, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>, and a teeny bit of risque humor. As such, several parents have complained about the show's content, and Disney themselves hardly make any merchandise for it (aside from the aforementioned tote bags and books) because it's not for little kids - or at least, not for children as young as many of their shows skew towards.
<ul><li> The "cutesy merchandise for little kids" phenomena is bizarrely played with in the case of the official activity book "Dipper and Mabel's Guide to Mystery and Nonstop Fun", published during early season 2. The basic idea is that the twins found an old blank book lying around, and Dipper decided to write adventuring tips for whoever finds it next, while Mabel added "fun" pages about things such as a monster fashion show and instructions on how to make your own paper pet. Although the book is very silly and the writing of it is probably not canon, a lot of the things mentioned in it <em>are</em> canon, and some cryptograms in the book turned out to foreshadow major events from later in the show. Also, the adventure sections mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfBlood">blood rain</a> and have a page for figuring out if you're possessed by a demon, and there's a part where Dipper passes out and then wakes up to find that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Bill Cipher</a> wrote some spooky stuff in his book and he can't get rid of it no matter what he does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> was originally pitched as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">animesque</a> cartoon aimed at teenagers. However, when networks weren't interested, they <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBO-aA9QN08">turned it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> into a computer-generated cartoon aimed at younger audiences. However, it has still gained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> with a significant cult following. Granted, some of them <em>do</em> wish the original pitch had been picked up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>, which began airing in 1986, was one of the first and most valiant attempts to break out of the Ghetto. It worked to some degree, for a time, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> kicked in. It helps that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">its parent film</a> was one of the least kid-friendly movies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">to be mistaken for being for kids</a> to come out of the 80s.
</li><li> The animated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em> is an infamous example amongst British audiences. Brought out in the late 70s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait">and often broadcast on TV at Christmas time</a>, a cartoon about talking bunny rabbits having an adventure seems like the perfect thing to stick in front of the kids for a couple of hours, right? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverdrawnAtTheBloodBank">You could</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasChamber">not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats">be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence">wrong</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> has been noted for its ability to entertain both kids and adults, but a lot of people tend to believe that it is a kids' show and it is broadcast as a kids' show despite all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/Kaeloo">adult jokes</a> in it.
</li><li> While they tend to serve as a middle ground for both kids and adults, animated action shows are the frequent victim to this stigma. It's all too easy for parents and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> alike to rip a network a new one over a show's violent content or themes. Many shows had to either tone down the content or be moved to a later time slot, if not outright canceled.
<ul><li> It's also worth mentioning that because of how expensive action cartoons are in general, most of the shows produced for television tend to have less of a chance in longevity. Their main source of revenue is from merchandising and video sales, which don't always sell for various reasons despite the show's popularity. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yw0b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yw0b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yw0b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">theatrically-released action cartoons (i.e. <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> and <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em>) don't usually have this problem since most of the money can be made back from ticket sales alone.</span> It's easier for networks to produce animated comedies because they're less expensive, binge-friendly, and more likely to turn a profit from kids without any hassle from their parents or watchdogs. Even when a network does produce an action action, it's always the more darker, serious-toned, and older-skewing series that get the least support, in contrast to shows wholeheartedly aimed at children (a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scarymommy.com/5-cartoon-series-adults-love-kids/">This website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claims that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> is a children's show. While the series does have a few great messages about family, and is a lot tamer than your typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> cartoon, <em>Bob's Burgers</em> is anything but a kids show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets">The Crumpets</a></em> is mainly identified and distributed as a children's show, and it's a loose adaptation of a line of French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureBooks">Picture Books</a>. Looking deeper, it isn't exactly a kid-friendly show when it happens to contain parental sex, nudity, animal harm (like birds getting shot), suicide jokes, a substance addiction crisis that encompasses <em>children</em>, mild profanity, and grown-up topics like adultery and money. In season 3, many of these elements became mild or nonexistent.
</li><li> TV Guide UK once classified <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OurCartoonPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OurCartoonPresident">Our Cartoon President</a></em> as a children's show because of the word "cartoon" appearing in its title. Because of this, kids' shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HorridHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HorridHenry">Horrid Henry</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> appeared as recommended, and it was also recommended to several shows aired on Cartoonito <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note82f93');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note82f93" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note82f93');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> a British preschool channel run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a></span> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam">Fireman Sam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CuriousGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CuriousGeorge">Curious George</a></em>. The show itself actually has tons of vulgar language and several examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>. The listing would later be corrected and is now categorized under the correct label of "Comedy".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>'s streaming service Peacock <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46705725/here-are-the-movies-and-shows-coming-to-peacock">classifies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FatherOfThePride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FatherOfThePride">Father of the Pride</a></em> as a children's show, sandwiched in between things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostmanPat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostmanPat">Postman Pat</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears">Care Bears</a></em>. This is despite the fact that this trope was part of the reason it was a Short-Runner: it was promoted as a family show, but actually was made with an adult audience in mind.
</li><li> This is one of the reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> was cancelled and retooled into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies">Spinoff Babies</a> show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramarama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramarama">Total Dramarama</a></em>. Despite the fact that it has a lot of adult humor (mainly in the earlier seasons), the show ended up canned because the premise of the show was no longer appealing to children, in spite of the large adult and teenaged fanbase. Many people viewing it as a kids show doesn't help at all.

<ul><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> itself has averted this for the most part, there have been complaints by some users of the site as well as critics of the site simply because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedSeries">Animation works</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationTropes">tropes</a> are cataloged. A number of these complaints can be summarized as "why does this site catalog these stupid kids cartoons instead of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">proper literature</a>"?" and such. Of course, this is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability">There Is No Such Thing as Notability</a> rule exists...it apparently never crosses any of these folk's minds to actually add whatever works and tropes they so want to see here.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note90ot5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note90ot5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note90ot5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Amusingly enough however, many of the sites that tend to complain about this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">tend to document little to nothing of what they consider as "proper literature" themselves</a>, so go figure.</span>
<ul><li> This trope is at least part of the reasoning behind the Animated Film/Live-Action Film (tellingly often just "Film") split - because how dare kiddy cartoons be treated as on equal footing with live-action entertainment? (Of course, a lot of it is simple clarity: Is an animated feature "Film" or "Western Animation"?)
</li></ul></li><li> Likely not intended; but TiVo suggestions, if left on, would often give you suggestions based on what channel you recorded. If you recorded something off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> block, it wouldn't be uncommon to see it suggesting stuff for younger audiences.
<ul><li> Netflix tends to do this as well.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Phenomena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Phenomena">Phenomena</a></em> debuted in Norway in 2002, the country was stuck in the mindset that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">video</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">animation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">fantasy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">books</a> had to be for kids. Due to this, <em>Phenomena</em> was initially given a 10-12 rating, but eventually Gyldendal (the publisher) removed their 10-12 imprint and gave it a 9+ rating... despite the series featuring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Rape</a>, some more implied rapes, gruesome violence, drug use, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackandGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackandGrayMorality">Blackand Gray Morality</a>, and more. Since then, more fantasy works have been created in Norway, and despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Halvgudene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Halvgudene">some</a> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kire">others being</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, they all got 13+ ratings from the start. <em>Phenomena</em>, meanwhile, was still saddled with a 9+. The same mistake would happen again with the spin-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PictureBooks">Picture Books</a>, which are even gorier, containing lots of blood, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a>, scalping, and a character becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">Extreme Omnivore</a>... and they were rated <em>8+</em>.
</li><li> The 1988 book <em>Animation From Script To Screen</em> is a good example of how an analysis of Western animation can both try to avert this trope and end up reinforcing it. It's written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShamusCulhane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShamusCulhane">James ("Shamus") Culhane</a>, an unsung legend in the history of animation, who worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo</a></em>, as well as many other features for Disney. Culhane had an encyclopedic knowledge about animation (as well as other subjects) and pretty eclectic tastes: he praised Ralph Bakshi and Richard Williams (head animator for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em>, which was a big movie hit at the time), ridiculed the commercially-driven dreck on Saturday morning TV, and tried to present animation as a serious art form indebted to (among others) Michelangelo and Sergei Eisenstein. He even warns writers for cartoons <em>never</em> to target children only, because only if you write for adults will you be completely uncondescending. However, his prejudices toward his own profession still show through at times. He assumes that most animators aspire to make people laugh - which would be fine, except that it implies that cartoons cannot inspire any emotion other than hilarity. He also writes that "very subtle acting may never be possible to meet in this medium." (If only Culhane, who died in 1996, could have lived to see the "performances" of the characters in the Pixar and DreamWorks movies!)
</li><li> Quick: What channel on cable television, at the height of its popularity, delivered the most shows where the characters were either animated or had a cast consisting of at least 50% puppets? If you guessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>, you would be wrong. The answer was the Sprout Network,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1070w4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1070w4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1070w4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Now Universal Kids.</span> a 24 hour preschool channel which had 100% animated or puppet broadcast. Even the live segments always had at least as many puppets as people. The only questionable exceptions were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWiggles">The Wiggles</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a></em>, which have significant numbers of characters in full-body puppets, but do not always meet the 50% mark.
</li><li> Back in 2012, the Polish television channel Polsat had an advert that announced the showing of several CGI films. How does the advert begin?

Because everything animated made before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> is kiddie fare... granted, if the only cartoons you know from before 2000 are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoons, it's not surprising you're holding that kind of an opinion.
</li><li> Also as of March 2012, main Italian network <em>RAI</em> is currently <em>the</em> biggest offender of this trope. To clarify, while animation on RAI used to be far more prominent throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> animated shows started to appear at a progressively smaller rate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">until they were completely confined within an early morning timeslot.</a> Then, in the mid-2000s, the RaiGulp channel, aimed at a younger demographic, rose to fame as the "safe place" for animation in general, and most arrows were pointing to a fairly brighter future: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom">Ruby Gloom</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>, any good show, you name it. <em>Then</em>, however, things went downhill at the beginning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, where "kid [soap] operas" like <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grachi">Grachi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1116xv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1116xv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1116xv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(The fact we don't have an article for that here should tell you something.)</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">started overshadowing animation</a> at an alarming rate, culminating in live-action series getting the spotlight and <em>nearly all animated shows being confined to an after-midnight timeslot.</em> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> among them.
<ul><li> RAI then subverts this trope <strong>only</strong> around Christmas, where it becomes the equivalent of the Golden Age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">on steroids.</a> Yeah, the same network that nearly denies the existence of animation as a medium, does the complete opposite in mid-December by nearly running a marathon of <em>the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a></em>.
</li><li> Yet again, RAI made a new channel, Rai 4, which would be composed of anything that doesn't fulfill RAI's canon on TV series. This channel includes a small late-night section for anime such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MawaruPenguindrum">Mawaru-Penguindrum</a></em>. This didn't stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> for trying to ban this rather small part of the channel because the anime clearly weren't for kids, regardless of the time they were actually broadcasted.
</li><li> And they subverted it once more with their badge of idents in September 2016, which have been somewhat begrudgingly compared to Cartoon Network idents.
</li></ul></li><li> The cable provider Verizon FiOS seems to think that, just because anime series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CasshernSins">Casshern Sins</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> air on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> (when in fact they air on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>, the channel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Watershed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Watershed">Watershed</a> hour), they can be categorized as "children's shows".
<ul><li> This has become less prevalent over time thanks to the more generic "animated series" description, including having separate "Cartoon Network" and "[adult swim]" sub-sections in their On Demand service. Verizon and other providers still have issues dealing with networks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">nominally</a> cater to children during the day and adults during the night in regards to "suggestions" that pop up, however; switching from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickToons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickToons">Nick Toons</a> to CN at 1 PM is safe, but not so much at 1 AM...
</li></ul></li><li> According to People magazine <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "The Longest Daycare" and all the animated shorts nominated for Oscars are ways kids can "get into the spirit of awards season". WTF?!

</li><li> Science museums <a class="urllink" href="http://boingboing.net/2011/09/23/science-museums-are-failing-grown-ups.html">have the same problem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, being seen as mainly for children. Adult science enthusiasts have to settle for books, magazines and TV programs like Nova, which don't offer the hands-on experiences that museum exhibits do.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a> considers fans of "children's shows" and anime as creepy, socially-moronic nerds, and its userbase won't hesitate to tell you that, outside of the less goony subboards. Posting about anime unironically out of the dedicated anime subboard usually warrants at least one annoyed goon, mockery, and/or a probation.
<ul><li> Similarly, discussion of Japanese games and cartoons in 4chan, outside of /a/ or /jp/ (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">and even in them</a>), can and will get the random troll sparking a flame war over people liking this "weeaboo shit".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12tbbv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12tbbv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12tbbv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Though that's due more to others suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCringe">Cultural Cringe</a> talking up Japanese superiority in the past.</span>
</li><li> This has notably changed <em>massively</em>, as anime becomes more mainstream; while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">certain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">aspects</a> of anime are still ripe for mockery, many goons are openly anime fans, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> discussion has a habit of horribly derailing threads.
</li></ul></li><li> In Hungary, there's a catch-all term used for all animation: "mese", or "fairytale" in English,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note132xh3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note132xh3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note132xh3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The word used for "cartoon" is "rajzfilm" (literally drawn-film)... what came first, the ghetto or the shift in word-usage, is a chicken and egg question.</span> which makes the position of animated shows much worse, as "mese" is traditionally a word that describes children's fiction. But even Hungary produced adult themed animations (e.g. a rather grotesque take on Snow White satirizing the communist state). This semantic inconsistency has lead to some people coming to regard "mese" as a term only applicable to softer, more kid-friendly and generally fantasy-themed productions, but most still use it as a synonym of "animation" anyway.
</li><li> A rare written example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> had this happen a little bit - they were originally written for children, but have a sizable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>. Some countries actually published more "Grown-up" covers to make adults feel less ashamed about it. This mentality has <em>drastically</em> started to reduce.
<ul><li> Harry Potter was designed to "grow up" with the audience. The earlier books were basically children's books, while the later ones (book 4 onwards), were aimed more at teenagers.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> deconstructed the ghetto in his <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/princess-mononoke-1999">review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>, pointing out that animation can tell certain stories much better than live-action.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection">The Criterion Collection</a> struggled with this trope for years; owing to Disney and other major animation studios keeping their top-drawer material to themselves, for many years the only animated feature in the collection was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>, and only on laserdisc. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> the wall came down: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticMrFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticMrFox">Fantastic Mr. Fox</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/FantasticPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/FantasticPlanet">Fantastic Planet</a></em> have all become part of the collection.
</li><li> Averted in many political propaganda films. As it is at times easier to exaggerate the flaws and successes in animation more so than in live-action plenty of politicians use the medium to fulfill their status quo in personal reunions, as evidenced by the amount of animation in stuff such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50ZebmQq51Q">''Education for Obedience''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It is however played straight during election campaigns where animation is rarely used. This has probably to do with the fact that it might be important to see who you are voting for. The heavy usage of this medium during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> is however a big reason why animation is taken as a serious medium by historians, especially because there is a decent flood of it because it was an easy source for those who could not read.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TurnerClassicMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TurnerClassicMovies">Turner Classic Movies</a> rarely shows animated material. There's nothing in their rules against it so they have shown animation, and have covered a far larger swath of it than most people recognize exists: silent-era shorts, classic MGM and Warner Bros. shorts, the two features of the Fleischer Brothers, <em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a></em>, B-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a> titles like <em>The Reluctant Dragon</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwiceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwiceUponATime">Twice Upon a Time</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomTollbooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomTollbooth">The Phantom Tollbooth</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> films have all been covered. But in part since the channel is about the last place in North America to extensively show pre-1970 films, foreign-language films, silent films, etc., animation has to compete with all of those live-action films for airtime!
</li><li> A college textbook about restaurant marketing claimed that family-friendly restaurants such as Applebee's and McDonald's only advertise on channels that show cartoons (never mind the fact this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">clearly untrue</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AFIS100YearsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AFIS100YearsSeries">The American Film Institute</a> zigzags the trope with their published lists. Animated films are represented on several of their lists, including two on one of their Top 100s (<em>Snow White</em> #29, <em>Toy Story</em> #99). But many of these are in low placements and lost amidst many live-action American Films. Including animation as a "genre" on their <em>Ten Top 10</em> lists indicated their level of apathy by lumping an entire medium together as a distinct genre. On their year end best-of lists, PIXAR in their heyday had all their films listed for their years, along with <em>Shrek</em> in 2001, <em>Happy Feet</em> in 2006, and <em>Coraline</em> in 2009 (alongside <em>Up</em> to boot). In 2015, animation returned to their lists with <em>Inside Out</em> and <em>Zootopia</em> the year following. But these still barely made the cut and only one per year seems to suggest the ghetto is still strong. You may have also noticed most of these awarded films are Disney movies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimationIsDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimationIsDisney">which is its own separate issue</a>. Though this may be justified a little, since as far as <em>America</em> was concerned, Disney pretty much held a monopoly on the medium until about the 70s.
<ul><li> The TV section is no better. <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>South Park</em>, both adult shows, are the only animated programs to have been listed in their TV section. And no animated show has been on there since 2002!
</li></ul></li><li> It's worth mentioning that while the Ghetto's stigma has died down in the west with the airing of adult animation on television, there still exists people who, while acknowledging that not all of them are made for kids, still refuse to watch cartoons of any kind on their own time as they find the medium in general "immature".
</li><li> Strangely, in the United States, studios are on board with producing adult-oriented cartoons for TV, DVD, and the web given their success on these platforms, yet they're still hesitant on producing such cartoons for theaters for reasons unknown. This is possibly because of major studio execs thinking adult animation is still a niche medium that won't bring in the same type of success as they do on other platforms. This is the reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty">Sausage Party</a>'s</em> success at the box office has many in the industry excited as they believe it could finally lead to a wave of theatrically-released adult animation from Hollywood.
<ul><li> As of 2020, this appears to finally be happening. Since 2016, no less than three successful adult animated movies have been released in American theaters: the aforementioned <em>Sausage Party</em>, the Polish/British/American co-production <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent">Loving Vincent</a></em>, and the stop-motion <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IsleOfDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IsleOfDogs">Isle of Dogs</a></em>. A number of other adult animated films are planned for the near future. They include <em>America: The Motion Picture</em> (a satirical take on the founding of the United States being produced by Netflix), an animated horror movie called <em>To Your Last Death</em>, an R-rated comedy called <em>Fixed</em> directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenndyTartakovsky">Genndy Tartakovsky</a>, a film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em>, and a possible sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPicturesAnimation">Sony Pictures Animation</a> has also announced its commitment to producing animated films for adults.
</li></ul></li><li> On a related note, many have criticized the rating system of the MPAA, which has a history of assigning films with mismatched ratings without rhyme or reason. One example being the 1975 animated film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coonskin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coonskin">Coonskin</a></em> which received an R rating by the association when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">director's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat">previous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyTraffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyTraffic">titles</a> earned an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameContentDifferentRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameContentDifferentRating">X rating for having much of the same content as the latter</a>. Granted it's worth noting that a film's rating doesn't always accurately reflect its content and instead indicates the audience best suited for it, but this only leads us back to the ghetto since most audiences would still associate most live-action PG movies as being for adults over animated films.
</li><li> Up until 1998, Billboard had this problem when classifying CDs and VHS tapes based on adult-based animation. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> CD "Songs In The Key Of Springfield" <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22songs+in+the+key+of+springfield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ_6mYjfvaAhUkw1kKHSM5C5wQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">was classified as a "Kid Audio" CD<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> alongside CDs featuring traditional children's songs and music from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em>, and VHS tapes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2w8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=beavis+and+butt+head+law+abiding+citizens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO86GLjvvaAhWlwVkKHbiQAAcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">were listed alongside<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tapes based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime">The Land Before Time</a></em>.

She tells them that she isn't concerned about the game's violence because it's a cartoon and she's old enough to watch them.

It has been argued that this trope is the reason the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> series only received one entry to cover all movies whereas every movie of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> trilogy each got its own entry.
</li><li> As a result of being fined for violating COPPA<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note144ylh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note144ylh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note144ylh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Children's Online Privacy Protection Act". To put a long story short, someone saw all the re-emerging and endless pirated/bootlegged, constantly copyright-infringing videos that several channels use to make money by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubeKidsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubeKidsChannel">baiting impressionable small children</a> into watching them (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YoutubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YoutubePoop">YTPs</a>, although some of these bootlegs include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a>), and saw them as an attempt to gather private information from children under 13</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> made this into an official policy of sorts (in effect as of January 6, 2020); while you can manually mark your video(s) as not being suitable for children under 13, an automatic system scans all videos for typical signs of it being made for children, which includes bright colors, 2D animation and the video title or description mentioning the name of a popular children's franchise (for instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em>). If it is marked as being suitable for children but it's determined as being an attempt to gather their info, one can get fined for up to $42,000. And if <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reclaimthenet.org/youtube-coppa-changes-violent-videos-made-for-kids/amp/">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is to be believed, things have already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">gone</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">sideways</a>...
</li><li> One advertising engine that supplies the ads to several websites, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a>, falls under this trope. It's very common to see ads for products aimed at kids, or touring shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol Live!</a></em>, on webpages talking about adult animation or anime aimed at mature audiences.
<ul><li> Prior to the implementation fo COPPA, this also happened on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. It was pretty common to see things like ads for (mostly unlicensed) mobile games based on stuff like <em>Peppa Pig</em> or a pre-roll ad for a show like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WheresWaldo2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WheresWaldo2019">Where's Waldo?</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> on anything from clips of otaku-oriented anime to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop">YouTube Poops</a> of children's shows.
