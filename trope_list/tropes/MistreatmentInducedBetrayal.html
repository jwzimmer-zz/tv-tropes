Lumsy disliked K. Rool's plan to destroy the island where the Kongs live. In response, K. Rool imprisoned him. Conveniently enough, all of the Kongs' progress occurs as a direct result of K. Lumsy's intervention. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Way to antagonize the guy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">who's about as big as the island you're trying to destroy</a>, K.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kyle Schneider and Dr. Drago Pettrovich Madnar's reasons for defecting to Zanzibar Land in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2">Metal Gear 2</a></em>. In regards to Kyle Schneider, he initially supported NATO/FOXHOUND in regards to taking down Outer Heaven, but after Outer Heaven was destroyed, he and his resistance were stabbed in the back so to speak when NATO commenced an air raid that completely and indiscriminately wiped out pretty much a lot of people, and he himself was also captured and experimented upon at NATO for an extraterrestrial special forces project. After traveling to the Mercenary War, he ended up joining Big Boss and Outer Heaven not just due to what NATO did to him, but also because unlike NATO, Big Boss actually saved his resistance as well as the rest of his soldiers. As for Madnar, after defecting to America from the Soviet Union, even abandoning his own daughter, his treatment by the American government and the Scientific Community was... not too good to put it simply. Aside from being ridiculed for his theories about Metal Gear, he also was frequently abused by his superiors and often treated with complete contempt, especially when they only wanted him to make stuff like SDI, NEDW, and brain bombs. Eventually, he had enough and joined Zanzibar Land.
</li><li> Although not a direct result of Outer Heaven, it is implied that Gray Fox's defection to Zanzibar Land, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">his obvious loyalty to Big Boss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">his need for war</a>, also came from a Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal. While watching the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988, Gray Fox (living under the paper-thin alias of Frank Hunter [his last name, Jaeger, was German for Hunter]) he ended up falling in love with Gustava Heffner, a ice-skating competitor from Czechoslovakia, and they attempted to elope together, with her attempting to defect to America. Unfortunately, America rejected her request, which also made life a living hell for her and the rest of her family as she was stripped of her competition rights and she and her family were later hunted down. Suffice to say, Gray Fox was not too happy about this at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> has a rather twisted double subversion: The President of the United States, James Johnson, secretly worked with the Sons of Liberty in their Big Shell takeover because he was never given any real power besides creating an illusion that the People actually voted for him under their free will, and wanted to have power similar to The Patriots. However, they presumably refused to grant him this. Unfortunately, this backfires on him when Solidus ends up keeping him alive just to reconfirm his vital signs, stating that "pawns cannot become players." It is also later revealed by Ocelot that even his reasons for defecting were in fact manipulated by The Patriots, and the script even mentions this.
</li><li> Ocelot is a slight subversion. At first, it seems as though he aids Snake in stopping Volgin because he became too disgusted with his former employer to continue working with him. However, it turns out that the real reason why he's aiding Snake is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that was his mission given to him by the CIA, his true employers</span>. Possibly played straight in Portable Ops, when he executes the CIA Director in cold blood if one buys his statements about regaining what the DCI stole from them about The Boss.
</li><li> In <em>Portable Ops</em>, Elisa defects to Naked Snake's side when she realizes that Gene is going to launch a nuke due to negotiations failing since she feels that nukes should never be used after she was exposed to radiation from the Khystym Disaster. Ursula, although she took longer, also ended up turning against Gene (it is also implied that the reason why she didn't turn sooner is that she didn't discover her boss's true intentions until after she barely survived her battle with Snake. Cunningham also intended to go through with the Pentagon's plan of defacing the CIA's reputation due to their casting him aside when he was forced to amputate his leg, and also because of disgust towards them for selling The Boss out.
</li><li> Huey Emmerich initially worked for the Peace Sentinels under the belief that he could maintain true peace under deterrence and not have to launch a nuke even once. After discovering that Coldman, the leader of the Peace Sentinels, had actually planned to launch a nuke just to show the world its power, and presumably to get a step up in negotiations with the CIA (the organization he used to run as director until they eventually became so disgusted with him they ended up Kicking him Upstairs to Station Chief of Central America), he ended up going against him, and his chances of defecting from him increased substantially after Coldman pushed him down the stairs. Although not as clear, Strangelove was also implied to have undergone a similar Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal. If the player managed to complete the quick-time event that cumulates in Snake swiping Strangelove's ID badge, she apparently allows Snake to keep the badge. The fact that the torture sessions afterwards do not show her with an ID badge at any point hints at Snake stealing her ID badge being canon, which means that she was actually helping Snake, the one person she hated the most due to his involvement in The Boss's death, escape and presumably take down Coldman's group.
</li><li> Big Boss <em>himself</em>. His entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> was triggered by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having to kill his maternal figure The Boss.

This worked out, but the power of said machines made the other inhabitants of Hyrule fearful, and the Sheikah were banished from the kingdom lest they become a threat. While some abandoned their technology in order to be readmitted back into mainstream society, others, who came to be known as the Yiga Clan, decided to take revenge against Hyrule by swearing their allegiance to Ganon and eliminating any who opposed the Demon King.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em>, since Sixshot wasn't exactly loyal to Galvatron in the first place.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> also plays with this a little on several occasions. It makes an effort to set up a "chicken or the egg" question of if Megatron berates and brutalizes Starscream so often because of Starscream's treacherous nature or if Starscream is so treacherous against Megatron because <em>Prime</em> Megatron is a horrendously abusive and dubiously sane commanding officer. Megatron's callous disregard for the lives of his own men gives Starscream a following among some of the other Decepticons, including Breakdown considering his offer to join him when Starscream's time came or Knockout being perfectly willing to finish Megatron off to become Starscream's Dragon. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ironically, in Starscream's last episode, he renounces his ambition to usurp Megatron and becomes a loyal officer right when Airachnid is trying to worm her way back into Megatron's good graces.

<ul><li> Near the end of Season 2, Dreadwing, after learning that Starscream was the one who turned his brother, Skyquake, into a Terrorcon zombie and disgraced his death, and that Megatron was willing to hide that fact from him, betrays the Decepticons by handing over the Forge of Solus Prime to the Autobots, though he stays with the Decepticons.

<ul><li> In the same season, Varrick is an unscrupulous businessman and mad scientist and has had no issues at all helping the tyrannical overlord Kuvira with her conquests. When he starts to show just a hint of reluctance about weaponizing Spirit energy though, her immediate response isn't to reason with him but to hurl him off a moving train. He switches sides shortly after.

But according to Arnold himself, colonial command had not acknowledged his role in any early American successes in the war, including Saratoga, which was the battle that convinced France to enter the war on behalf of the Americans and was won almost entirely by Arnold; at the time this was the highest insult to an officer. Then, when he was military governor of Philadelphia, his political opponents charged him with corruption, and he officially reprimanded for it. Also, he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">extremely jealous man</a> who thought he deserved all the promotions other officers were obtaining. So, he offered to betray the Americans in return for a hefty sum of money and a generalship in the British army. In return, he offered them West Point (which at the time was named Fort Arnold, for him). Days afterward, Washington offered him command of approximately half the Continental Army. He refused, citing a leg injury he received at Saratoga, and asked for West Point instead. His plan would have succeeded, except his contact in the British Army was captured the night Arnold gave him the information (on paper) about the fort that the British would have used to take it.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, escaped slaves were more than happy to provide assistance and information to the Union Army, for obvious reasons. Things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">only got worse</a> for their former masters when the Union Army started accepting black enlistees.
</li><li> This was one of the reasons why Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick and the original Kingmaker, deserted Edward IV of England and restored Henry VI to the throne (apart from Edward finally demonstrating he was not Warwick's puppet). Warwick had bled for the Yorkist cause at Towton and was in the middle of negotiating a marriage for Edward to a princess of France when he got word that the king had already married. The woman he married, at the time, was completely unsuitable, being the widow of a Lancastrian commander, a commoner, and something of a parvenu who secured all the best positions at court for her relatives, who, until a few months before, had been sworn enemies to the Yorkists. Warwick was also left in the embarrassing position of having to explain to the King of France why his daughter had been jilted. It's no wonder that Warwick defected and brought a significant portion of Edward's support with him.
</li><li> Played straight throughout the ages on armies based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a>. Conscripts are more prone to desert, surrender or set up a mutiny than professional soldiers since they have personally little else on stake but their own personal survival while subjugated to harsh conditions and discipline, constant fear of death and few amenities. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> variant of this trope was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Liberation_Army">Vlasov Army<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Costa Rica team was performing way beyond their paygrade and everything seemed to be going fine; cue their elimination and trip back home, where they were received as heroes. Some days later, coach Jorge Luis Pinto was dismissed from the national team on the players' accounts of him being one of the most overbearing and accosting people they've ever had to work with; the accusations included the coach showing up at the players' homes when they called in sick to verify that they were actually sick, endless hounding of the players and the support staff, and being a remarkably rude person as a whole. Though Costa Rica was thoroughly grateful for his work in the team, they soundly asked him to never, ever come back. If they had bothered to ask why Pinto was ousted from the Colombia National Team, they would have found that a coach like him demands too much patience and that Pinto left few friends at the Colombian Federation, leaving with a reputation of being a remarkably caustic man; granted, he is an incredibly talented coach if you don't mind being stripped of your privacy and dignity. In hindsight, and after reviewing the video evidence, it was noted by the media that none of the players or the support staff in Costa Rica ever celebrated scoring with their coach. When Pinto sought support in the eve of his ousting, he found no friends in his staff.
</li><li> Sima Quin, the great Chinese historian, described this trope as the reason for the first major rebellion against the Qin dynasty, which relied on extremely heavy punishments for even minor offenses to maintain order. This lead to a situation where a military unit found itself late and realized that since the penalties for lateness and rebellion were both death, they might as well rebel and die fighting.

In the interim, Gunn was hired to write and direct a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad</a></em>, which he will complete first before resuming work on the third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>.
