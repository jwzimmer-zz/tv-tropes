Monaghan is initially just incredulous that he's remembered at all, as he was mostly an unimportant contract killer who shot mobsters for money... though he doesn't take long to start giggling at the fact that, among other things, "Natalie" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">was actually Natt.</a>

Superman and Supergirl were metas from Krypton who gained their powers from exposure to Kryptonite radiation. Supergirl was the last being to leave Krypton after many failed attempts to save the planet. She and Supermen then journeyed to Earth, where they fell in love, got married and had a son, Superboy. Supergirl gained the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshift</a> from Kryptonite radiation and used it to transform into her secret identity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lo Slane</a>.

The museum does acknowledge that some archival sources suggest that Guy came from a dysfunctional family and that he was a high school dropout, a mediocre sportsman and an "obnoxious, womanizing hothead" who turned on the Green Lantern Corps. However, the tour guide Lumita claims that all of these stories are either inaccurate or were deliberately created to sully Guy's reputation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out that Guy is still alive and well, Lumita is his daughter and he created Warriors to promote himself and his legacy.</span>

Hatchet's main objective when writing is to depict the protagonist, Lio Convoy, as a manipulative and violent revolutionary who was responsible for just about everything bad that happened in the war, apparently in contrast to the common narrative that he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> who saved the planet. (Neither of these are true; Lio did cause or allow some morally ambiguous things, but he was generally a good guy who was entirely right to rebel.)

This was all done by the gods in order to remove the sinful and impure from the planet, and their ancestors survived because they honored the gods and were righteous (they lived in the shadow of a massive military complex that served as a government retreat and survival bunker, surrounded by last-ditch nuclear explosives whose radiation kept the Psychlos away). When Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, the protagonist, encounters other isolated people, they each have their own legend of what happened. The Scots, who have managed to retain a semi-accurate history because their territory received less attention from the Psychlos, remember America as a distant village that some other Scots went to and settled a long time ago.

This extends so far as to include a restaurant opening night that included as patrons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a>.

</li><li> Stephen Vincent Benet's short story "By the Waters of Babylon" supposes that not only has the United States of America ceased to exist as we remember it (apparently, it was destroyed in a great war), but the descendants of modern-day Americans have returned to living in tribes, hunting wild game with bows and arrows and forsaking Christianity for polytheism (believing, for example, that their ancient ancestors were actually gods). The protagonist finds a ruined statue at one point and notes that it depicts a man with long hair like a woman  in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>. However, the protagonist can only call Washington "Ashing", as only that much of the inscription on the statue is left intact.

Many planets retain reliable records, but some records of the past, especially of Old Earth, are not exactly precise. For example, the names of some famous authors ended up getting mangled (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a> is called "Annette McCloskey", while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault">Charles Perrault</a> is known as "Chaurl Perry"). Additionally, a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> characters and stories are now considered to be fairy tales in their own right, and some stories somehow ended up merged together, such as the story of King Kong and Conan the Barbarian, who slew him. There's also the slightly disturbing merging of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> crime and a children's story called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackAndTheBeanstalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackAndTheBeanstalk">Jack the Giant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Ripper</a></em>.

As its builders knew they didn't have either the time or the historical references to get it <em>all</em> right, they deliberately decorate it in the style of this trope (e.g. a sepia photo of Comanches with machine guns battling knights in armor) so that any <em>actual</em> incongruities will pass for more of the same kitsch.

The Galactic Empire is described as being founded by Alexander the Great (as the "First Empire"), with its capital (the "Imperial Seat") moving throughout the ages to Rome, Byzantium, Madrid, London, and Washington. Nations are reimagined as Galactic Empire-style noble Houses - e.g. House Washington (USA), House Windsor (Britain), House Zedong (China), House Ghandi (India), etc.
<ul><li> "House Washington" is described as being the first to use "atomics" (i.e. nuclear weapons), an invention of the "raw mentat" Einstein, in an "intra-provincial" war with "House Nippon" for control of trans-Pacific trade routes. Hitler, a "Pretender" to the Imperial Throne, in this history was overthrown during the previous decade.
</li><li> Stilgar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuneMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DuneMessiah">Dune Messiah</a></em> did not understand why Genghis Khan or Hitler were considered so historically significant, having killed "only" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">four and six million people, respectively</a> (by comparison, Paul Muad'dib's jihad has slaughtered at least sixty-one <em>billion</em> in only twelve years).
</li><li> Which is weird, considering how many characters in the series have access to the memories of their ancestors and predecessors (in Duniverse terms, "Other Memory"). The Bene Gesserit, who form the vast majority of those with access to Other Memory, consider written history to be fallible and little better than fiction (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>).

Millions of times in the ages to come those last few words would flash across the screen, and none could ever guess their meaning: A Walt Disney Production."</em></span>

Possibly these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> politico-economic sniping.
</li><li> A somewhat milder version is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>, where different planets retained different things in the transition from Earth to the "present" of the books. For example, Honor, while on Grayson, spots a large group of men walking through a park with wooden clubs and immediately assumes they are an angry mob (there has been much political and social tension of late, and an outbreak of mob violence is unpleasantly likely). She is about to call in her police forces when Andrew LaFollet points out they are just playing <em>baseball</em>, and those are just <em>bats</em>, not clubs. She has never heard of baseball, and asks if it is at all like <em>golf</em>, which Andrew has never heard of, and they spend a few minutes going back and forth, each comparing one sport to a different sport that the other has never heard of. In another book, William Alexander is visiting Grayson and remarks on how novel Iced Tea is, and how he is looking forward to introducing it at his next dinner party back on Manticore, while his older brother (Hamish Alexander) is impressed with the buttery-goodness of waffles, which he thinks compare quite favorably with the pancakes of Manticore. However, there is some information that has been lost to <em>both</em> cultures, as it seems that <em>nobody</em> can figure out just what a "movie" is, even though they know for a fact that at least one copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai">Seven Samurai</a></em> was brought on the original colony ship to Grayson. A humorous example comes from people who grew up on a space station and among other things believe that the people of old Earth used to believe in the Dollar, a boogieman responsible for ... a lot of problems that money has caused, but interpreted as daemonic possession rather than just the problems of capitalism. In another short story (also by Eric Flint), a Havenite secret agent is apparently unaware of what a dollar is... despite their country being at war with Manticore, whose currency is the Manticoran Dollar.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos">Hyperion Cantos</a></em> does this very subtly.

The journal's writer details her conversations with a historian and her world's concept of ancient history, based on wildly inaccurate and overly literal interpretations of present day records: among other things, they think silk was made from earthworms that ate mulberries, that a Turkish philosopher named Aries Tottle invented science, and that America was founded by warring tribes of cannibals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mirabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mirabile">Mirabile</a></em> is set on a colony world that has societies, such as the Australian Guild and the Texan Guild, which seek to resurrect and preserve the language and traditions of an Earth cultural group. They're working from written and filmed records rather than actual members of the group in question, so the results tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">The Theme Park Version</a> at best. The chapter "Getting the Bugs Out" has a subplot involving a guild that's come across the expression "bats in the belfry" and got the impression that this is a necessary element of the Gothic-style cathedral they're building.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em>: An early scene in the first book mentions an exhibit in London's museum featuring plastic statues of Mickey and Pluto, "animal-headed gods of lost America". Also several other examples, such as theories that those ancient heaps of rubbish they sometimes dig up were actually places where people would sacrifice valuables  as who would throw away such fantastically thin metal sheets of tinfoil? At the end of the series, a flash-forward reveals that in the far future, people don't believe that the central premise of the setting (mobile cities "eating" one another) ever happened and treat it as a story for children.
<ul><li> The prequel series <em>Fever Crumb</em> uses this trope as well. It seems to be an even bigger problem in Fever's time — while chronologically closer to our "present," Fever's society is less advanced than what develops by the time of <em>Mortal Engines,</em> and has a less rational and more mythologized understanding of history. One notable example is a play Fever helps put on that dramatizes the tale of mythical hero Niall Strong-Arm, who, at the behest of Mad King Elvis, steals Apollo's fiery chariot and uses it to woo Diana, Princess of the Moon. Fever herself, having a scientific mind-set, of course realises that the whole story must be mere fairy-tale, with no possible connection to any real history at all...

While professional historians still have some understanding of Earth's past, most people see historical figures like Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and Lenin as legendary heroes, all of whom lived at about the same time (i.e. during the "pre-Atomic age"). It's noted that the captain of a starship called the <em>Lenin</em> has no idea what Communism was actually about, despite being an aficionado of Russian culture.

Made more blatant than usual, despite the centuries long time skip between the trilogies, by the fact that due to the longevity of elves, several of the people in those stories were <em>still alive</em> (and for some reason had made no attempt to correct the histories).
</li><li> In <em>The Outrider</em> series by Richard Harding, someone sees a large sign near the ruins of Las Vegas advertising KINO CRAPS SLOTS and assumes it's a public insult directed at a guy named Kino.

As one character put it, they "know everything about everyone and everything they ever did."
</li><li> In Peter Ackroyd's <em>The Plato Papers</em>, set in the far future, the eponymous character is a Socratic orator as well as a student and teacher of history. He specializes in studying our own age, which he loves to expound on. Most of the works of the great author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> have been lost, except one: the novel <em>The Origin of Species</em> brilliantly satirizes the attitudes of the time while pretending to talk about natural phenomena. Most of what they know about the past land of "America" comes from a volume <em>Tales and Histories</em> retrieved from a casket labeled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">E. A. Poe</a>. American. 1809-1849". They believe that the inscription stands for "Eminent American Poet", indicating that "Poet" was a title given to historians as well as the writers of verse. It was a gloomy age — corroborated by other information that people of our time were obsessed with "webs" and "nets". They also uncovered an (ancient to them, far future to us) statue of a goddess inscribed with a map of the London Underground, from a time when the city of London was worshiped as a deity (none of this gives away any plot, by the way). The book works the other way around, as well, showing how different our conception of "reality" is from what is known in this far future time.

They also believe the Empire invented the metric system and had to force it on Earth. Oddly, they know a considerable amount about Sumerian culture because the stone tablets they wrote on have lasted much longer than the books and discs that we recorded our information on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RangersAtRoadsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RangersAtRoadsEnd">Rangers At Roads End</a></em>, it is known that in the past, people were more diverse and there were, for example, blondes and readheads and a greater variation of skintones. However, this knowledge is controlled by the religious authorities, and they don't make it widely known as they would then have to admit that the depictions in the temple (that show the Elder-Ones with green or blue skin and the like) are wrong.

He comments that they got the customs and clothing of that period wrong. Note that, due to a huge overhaul in human psychology (a forceful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">treatment that removes all aggressive impulses</a> instilled in every man's early childhood), the "old times" but a hundred years ago are even more incomprehensible for the future Earth-folk than Medieval times are for us.

Among other things, the origins of most of the relics found in the Outland are lost — several hardy machines are mistaken for unusual animal species — as are most details of Previous life and society. Certain notable Previous are remembered in a distorted manner, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">M'Donna</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris">Chuck Naurice</a>, while the difference between fiction and non-fiction accounts has gotten blurred — the Chromatacians are fairly confident that Oz wasn't a real place, but it took them some time to work that out.

Someone writes an article where he claims to have met this man and was told that in the year 10 million, all historical events from the year 0 A.D. to 1 million A.D. will be forgotten. Instead, history textbooks would read: <em>Following the death of Jesus Christ, there was a period of readjustment that lasted for approximately one million years.</em> The actual person in question is amused by the fabrication.

In one case, the secret holy name of Firbasforten passed on by the Holy Mother Church is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the colony's original designation, "Forward Fire Base Fourteen"</span>. This also tends to happen a <em>lot</em> in World's religious practices; the original tradition of looking up at the sky to pray (in part because Muslims among the original colonists couldn't agree on which direction Mecca would be) eventually evolved into the Mother Church's believers praying to the brightest non-solar object in that sky as their Goddess. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The object is actually a nearby gas giant.</span>

Here it is deliberate policy by the dictatorship, which has expurgated even the works of Marx and Lenin as insurance that nobody will be able to use them to reconstruct capitalism.

The organization he set up is intended to counter this very trope. It isn't working too well; another character mentions that it must be working because they have managed to recover copies of all three of Shackspire's plays.

His last name is <em>Merrilin</em>. This is a large-ish theme and plot point: since time is cyclical, the events of the novels are both our far future (several references to the age before the Age of Legends appear to be garbled versions of 20th century events such as the Cold War and the moon landing) and distant past, being the basis of several of our oldest stories (mostly Arthurian legends and Norse mythology).

They originally thought the flashing police lights were just an accessory that he was showing off and when they finally stopped, the cop asked Phil's dad: "Have you been drinking?" Phil's Dad cheerfully answers "yes" though he was referring to his soda. Really, about half of the jokes in the early part of the series was about how clueless the family is about the present, such as mentioning things that hadn't been invented yet, or trying to prove to Phil's teacher he is normal by having a dinner straight out the fifties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em> had the apes occasionally misinterpret human relics they found. The second episode "The Gladiators" had Prefect Farlow conclude that their (ape) ancestors must have been excellent metal-workers but while their work was very advanced, the use to which they put the metal was primitive. He then presented a golf club to Galen which he described as, "beautiful workmanship, but so inefficient for combat."

However, this might be because Holly's computer-senile and Rimmer is an idiot, rather than because it's the future. Holly also loves practical jokes.
</li><li> There is a cat race that evolved from Lister's pet cat over some 3 million years. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">based their culture and religious beliefs</a> on such oddities as Lister's laundry list (which they believed to be a star map).

This is definitely a case of stupidity, though, as Rimmer knows the difference between the two.

One of them finds an ordinary beer mug and believes it to be a ceremonial chalice, another is mystified at the sight of a parking meter. Strangely, when the archeologist guesses that the site dates back to the Renaissance, one character probes him if he means the 1600s. The archeologist confirms this. This somehow means that modern-day culture took place at the same time as the cultural revival on our world.

Despite being major fans of Superman and most info about Superman being public knowledge in their time, they get confused that Clark Kent doesn't meet most of their expectations. They thought he was already using the costume and Superman name, knew how to fly, and was willing to kill. Also, while they know about Clark's important friends like Lana Lang, Pete Ross, and Lois Lane, they've somehow never heard of Chloe Sullivan, even though she's his <em>sidekick</em>. This is probably a reference to how Sullivan is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em>, a group of recruits on a training expedition on Mars are repairing a communications array when they happen to check out the "sounds of Earth" message included for the benefit of any aliens finding an off-planet installation. Among the snippets is the song "Blitzkrieg Bop", by the Ramones. One of the recruits mentions that he's heard this one in his history studies, identifying it as being a song by "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>".

The joke is that if you don't know what it is, then it's "ritualistic", if you know what it is, but not what it is for, then it's "ceremonial".</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>: Oddly enough, one of the most perfect futures of all seems to fall into this trope at times. Characters often display a glaring degree of ignorance as to the workings of 20th century (or prior) Earth.
<ul><li> This is particularly notable in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "The Big Goodbye", which introduces the Holodeck, where even the ship's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> Historian is shown to be fairly clueless about how a 1930s era American city works.
<ul><li> Made even worse by the fact that Kirk and Spock had at least outline knowledge of 1920's Chicago in the TOS episode <em>A Piece of the Action</em> (with Spock specifically mentioning the effects of gang warfare on 20th-century Chicago's infrastructure) and a book on Chicago gangsters of the era was in print at most a hundred years prior to that episode. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy also seem to have a decent working knowledge of the era in <em>The City on the Edge of Forever</em> (along with access to an artifact that could clarify any discrepancies just by asking). Was the knowledge somehow lost in the century between Kirk and Picard?
</li><li> Whoever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">made the holodeck program</a> had it spot-on. It's more likely the Enterprise just wasn't carrying anybody who was an expert in that period of time.

An astronomer (a fresh-off-SNL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahSilverman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahSilverman">Sarah Silverman</a>, oddly enough) picks up the ship on her instruments and sends a greeting to the aliens she assumes are on board. Tom Paris, who treats twentieth-century culture as a hobby, is sent to smooth the situation over. He tells her that he and his colleague are secret agents, and then:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rain Robinson:</strong> The UFO, what is it? <br/><strong>Tom Paris:</strong> It's a Soviet spy satellite. Part of a massive KGB operation. We're trying to stop it. <br/><strong>Rain Robinson:</strong> Soviet? The USSR broke up five years ago. The KGB doesn't even exist anymore. <br/><strong>Tom Paris:</strong> That's what they'd like you to think.
</div></li><li> This is also lampshaded by Rain.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rain:</strong> You keep calling yourselves "secret agents", but nobody says "secret agents" anymore. You're always not quite getting things just quite right. It's as if you don't belong to this time period.

In a mix of this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">Politically Correct History</a>, the aliens interpreted fragmented records of the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">so as to vilify Voyager's crew</a> (the Doctor is an emotionless android, Seven forms her own mini-Borg collective, and Captain Janeway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack">wears black gloves</a>), imagining them as a band of bloodthirsty pirates and describing Voyager as a heavily-armed warship — because this let them interpret their own history more favourably. It is up to the Doctor to dig up historical evidence and clear the names of his long-dead crew-mates. It is later revealed that most of the episode is itself a historical record. After a second war, the members of the now combined civilization mention how The Doctor eventually set out for Earth on his own, since he wanted to see if his friends ever made it back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They did.</span>
</li><li> In "11:59", Janeway speaks with pride on her ancestor, Shannon O'Donnell, a star astronaut and one of the first Mars colonists who single-handily pushed through a massive tower project against huge opposition. But, going over Earth records, Janeway discovers that over the centuries, Shannon's "exploits" have been overblown: She was never an astronaut, she only consulted on the tower and there was no mass opposition to it. Janeway lampshades how records can be skewered to Chakotay.

(Technically, it was before the founding of Starfleet.)
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> points out, Brannon Braga in particular really tended to overplay the trope, like the <em>Voyager</em> episode where a 20th century truck is discovered floating in space, and Tom starts looking in it for "something called a key", despite keys still existing. He also has to explain what AM radio is to a science officer.
<ul><li> He doesn't so much describe it as explain why the <em>Voyager</em>'s sensors haven't picked up the AM transmission - they weren't calibrated to scan for it. Again, this indicates that some knowledge of history has been lost since the previous century - in multiple TOS episodes, Uhura and Spock are both able to pick up signals said to come from "amplitude modulation radio waves".
</li></ul></li><li> In general, it's implied that at least some of the reason various Star Trek crews have trouble understanding the past is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil">Good Cannot Comprehend Evil</a>.

One episode of <em>TNG</em> had the crew utterly baffled by the behavior of a fairly-typical group of cryogenically unfrozen people from the present, in a later one the entire crew is able to easily infiltrate 1890 San Fransisco (Even Data!).

Subverted when it turns out he's a 22nd century inventor who stumbled on a time traveler's ship, stole it, and was using it to steal technology from the future to reverse-engineer and take credit for inventing. After he is caught, Picard comments that 24th century historians would love to talk with a man from the 22nd century.

Cities such as Atlantys and Nova Yourk are cited as being the most legendary and ancient cities of Old Earth. Nations known as Jermani, Merica, Britania and Bania are said by scholars to have prospered and wilted during this time, while some tech-priests believe that ancient humans had to contend with orcs and brontosaurs and used enormous insects called onagers as beasts of burden. Given that they have only very general records of the founding of the Imperium in the 31st millennium, it's fairly impressive that they even know Earth is the original human homeworld. Virtually everything between those tidbits and the rise of the Imperium is <em>entirely</em> lost.
<ul><li> Someone <em>did</em> forget that Holy Terra is the original human homeworld: the <em>Horus Heresy</em> novels show Horus conquering for the Imperium a world whose emperor claimed his homeworld was the actual Earth and tried to force him to submit. Horus slayed him personally.
</li><li> They do retain some basic information concerning one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">ends</a> of the world — "Yndonesia" was a major player in one of the wars, that warriors clad in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">thunder armor</a>" were involved, and a few other details.
</li><li> Presumably this wasn't a huge issue, since the Emperor could have easily corrected the errors, having been personally involved in many important historical events. Sadly, he isn't currently able to fix any historical errors at the moment...
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> novels are rife with these. For example, a character reminisces his family's home in Merica, atop a cliff that had the carved faces of ancient kings chiselled into it. Also invoked by Games Workshop when fans complained that the novels didn't match what earlier fluff said happened. GW pointed out that all literature and fluff in <em>40k</em> is written from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> perspective and has therefore been filtered through ten thousand years of history. Officially the <em>HH</em> novels are what <em>actually</em> happened.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, a set of toys with the letters CCCP are found in one novel. CCCP stands for "Союз Советских Социалистических Республик", which in English is Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is a testament to how much humanity has lost in the WH40K universe that the discovery of the last earthly remnants of a thuggish dictatorship actually feels like a bittersweet triumph to the reader, and the reader still feels sadness that even this fragment of our own age will not be truly known to the characters that perceive it.
</li><li> In-universe, Bjorn is a living version of this trope for the Space Wolves and the Imperium as a whole. As one of the oldest living member of the Imperium (implied to be THE oldest) due to being a dreadnought and having walked alongside his Primarch Leman Russ and the Emperor when he was still of flesh and blood, Bjorn is revered by the Chapter for being the last link to the past they have and is often awaken on special days to recount the events of his youth. Unfortunately it's been roughly 10,000 years since he was entombed in a Dreadnought, his memory is heavily muddled and often gives a romanticized version of whatever story he was telling (although he still remembers that the Emperor emphatically did <em>not</em> want to be worshiped).
</li><li> The Dark Age of Technology is something of a misnomer — it was actually a Golden Age for humanity, with science allowing much safer Warp travel and living conditions than the modern Imperium. But since the "god" part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> wasn't there yet, the Ecclesiarchy makes sure everyone knows it was a horrible, soulless time.

In fact, they don't even know Elvis' <em>name</em> since the non-destroyed material they found referred to him only as "the King". But they took to his "teachings" of every man being free and independent to live his life as he wishes, and figure that since there was an entire school dedicated to being more like him before the War, he must have been someone highly respected and worthy of emulating. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">They're not exactly wrong, as such...</a>

This is especially weird since transwarp technology means that anybody with a transwarp-capable ship can jump back in time to see how things were.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em>: Nearly every episode in the first season has a brief segment at the end where Zeta and Ro look at an object from the past and come up with assumptions on what they were for that are way off. On one such occasion, Ro jumps to the conclusion that a diaper pin was used to actually pin the diaper to the baby rather than to keep the diaper together so it didn't fall off. Zeta replies to Ro's conclusion by reminding her that the past was a very barbaric time.

<ul><li> Most of what historians have discovered about past centuries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">has been revised when new facts were discovered.</a>
<ul><li> When occasionally people dug up dinosaur skeletons in the centuries before the 19th century they believed they had found the remains of animals that didn't survive Noah's flood. In China they thought they were digging up the bones of dragons.
</li><li> Even once the true nature of fossils was recognized, scientific assumptions about them could still be rather wide of the mark. Paleontologists of the early 19th century thought that the dinosaur genus <em>Iguanodon</em> was built like a reptilian rhinoceros, complete with a horn on its nose. Once more complete remains were uncovered it was realized that it had a considerably lighter build, could likely switch between moving on two legs and four (previously it had been assumed to be entirely quadrupedal), and the "horn" was actually a misplaced thumb claw.
</li><li> Many older visual representations of Ancient Greece or Rome show temples and buildings that are completely white, just like the ruins of these temples look today. Actually: back then all temples were painted in bright colors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate">Historical Beauty Update</a>: Many famous people in history have been portrayed according to the beauty ideals and standards of later centuries. Thus nowadays when we think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist">Jesus Christ</a> we imagine him as a white skinned, brown or black bearded man which would be very odd in the Middle East in the days of the Roman Empire. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a> is typically imagined to be a thin, slender 20th century style fashion model, while many rich people were actually quite plump or even obese back in the day. And, of course, all these people had perfect teeth, beautiful haircuts, no warts or other beauty spots and all look as if they take a bath every day.
</li><li> Our idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges">The Dark Ages</a> is also colored by 19th century ideas that this time period was savage, primitive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">filthy</a>, compared to the more <em>civilized</em> Greek and Roman era before it and the Renaissance and Enlightenment that came after it. Modern research has proven that the Middle Ages weren't always that backward.
</li><li> Before the age of photography almost every visual representation was made years later, since it was impossible to capture something on the moment it happened. This allowed artists to fantasize their own ideas of how a certain person or historical event looked. Even paintings made by eyewitnesses or while the subject was present to pose are dubious, since artists were forced to idealize or romanticize everything according to their patrons' wishes (when they didn't outright depict historical figures with the faces of the patron). It's a good rule of thumb that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll">the less idealized a portrait looks</a>, the more likely it is accurate.
</li><li> Very old paintings like those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HieronymusBosch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HieronymusBosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, for instance, mystify people of our day, because many scenes appear to be surreal antics. A lot of stuff, however, is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSymbolism">biblical symbolism</a> or puns on old sayings that are now mostly forgotten.
</li></ul></li><li> That was the concept of the Swiss exposition "futur antérieur", with how archaeologists of the Fifth Millennium might interpret 20th century society based what few archaeological remains would be conserved. The expo proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> the guesswork and conflation which sometimes occur in the historical reconstruction, as well as our tendency to link every little artifact with religion. Highlights include conflating the victory pose of sportsmen and that of a crucified Jesus; garden dwarves interpreted as statues of important leaders or priests (pottery conserves too) and motherboards reconstructed as 3D city maps.
</li><li> For decades, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillyTheKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillyTheKid">Billy the Kid</a> was believed to be left-handed because the only known photograph of him was reversed. This was corrected when experts more closely examined the rifle that he was holding in the photograph.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, of all things, underwent this sort of thing in 17th century Japan. With Christianity outlawed and European missionaries expelled or worse, the few thousand Japanese Christians (or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakure_Kirishitan">Kakure Kirishitans, "Hidden Christians"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) left had to worship in secret. Problem: there wasn't a Japanese translation of the Bible. So they wrote their own, with half-forgotten Catholic doctrine and already badly-translated, misremembered stories that had been passed down: hence in "Beginning of Heaven and Earth", "Deusu" creates "Adan" and "Ewo" in a Japanese Garden of Eden. The "Biruzen Maruya" is impregnated when Deusu, in the form of a butterfly, flies into her mouth. Pontius Pilate is distilled into Ponsha and Piroto. Jisusu proclaims: "The person who eats his rice with soup every morning is the one who will betray me." Maruya's friend composes a prayer at the River Abe (Ah-beh) — "Maruya, full of grace, to you I bow." Consequently, the prayer becomes known as the "Abe Maruya."
<ul><li> Relatedly, in the 19th Century, when trade opened up with the United States, a Japanese author produced a book called "Osanaetoki Bankokubanashi" (basically, "A Children's Illustrated Book of Countries") which contained a <em>highly-mythologized</em> history of the United States written for the benefit of Japanese children. In it, George Washington fights a tiger with his bare hands and defends his wife "Carol" from the British. They meet John Adams, who battles a giant serpent with his sword. Adams and Ben Franklin fight the British navy by holding cannons with their bare hands, until Adams' mother is swallowed by the returning serpent, so he seeks a mountain spirit who summons a giant eagle to aid him. The complete book <a class="urllink" href="https://archive.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kosho/bunko11/bunko11_a0380/bunko11_a0380_0002/bunko11_a0380_0002.html">can be found here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and historian Nick Kapur <a class="urllink" href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1062823813338091520.html">lays out the details.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> A less extreme present-day example: there's a nontrivial number of people (outside the fandom's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>, that is) who think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> was a real person, presumably because the series has just the right combination of age, popularity, lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a> elements, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">Direct Line to the Author</a> to encourage such things. People even still write to 221B Baker Street, his address in the novels (which didn't even exist when they were written), asking for Holmes's help. Since the 1930s, the Abbey National Building Society and then the Sherlock Holmes Museum have answered these letters, as they occupy the address.
</li><li> Modern depictions of prehistoric people painting invariably show them doing it deep in a cave. They likely painted on any surface available, especially outside where the light's better. However, paintings deep in caves were more likely to <em>survive</em> to the present day (and now there is concern that they are decaying due to visits from tourists whose breath introduces more moisture, causing the countries which have these sites to limit them).
</li><li> Most of what we believe about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> is greatly exaggerated. Cowboys rarely fought Native Americans. Most settlers' wagon trains weren't attacked (and circling the wagons created an almost unbeatable defense); similarly, most settlements didn't fight with the Native Americans very much. Desperadoes robbing banks were very rare, and most of those who did (the James gang, for example) were die-hard Confederate guerrillas who shifted to personal profit after the Civil War, rather than simply run of the mill criminals (who usually aimed at easier targets, as they lacked the skill of the former guerrillas). The image of dozens of wandering gunmen plying their deadly trade is a near complete fabrication from dime novels sold on the East Coast to promote the frontier. Most towns actually had strict <em>gun control</em>, something which is almost never shown in media (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em> being a major exception, in which it's actually a plot point).
