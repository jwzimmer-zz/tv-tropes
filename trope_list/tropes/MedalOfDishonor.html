In fact, it's for something of which you're very, very <em>not</em> proud and for which you <em>certainly</em> don't want an award.
</p><p><strong>There are two kinds of Medals of Dishonor:</strong>
</p><ul><li> The purposeful kind - The award is a joke specifically meant to make the recipient's life miserable, such as an "award" for "ugliest hair", "worst body-odor" or "tiniest brain". These can generally be treated in two manners.
<ul><li> The award is given publicly and is meant to make the receiver a figure of ridicule.
</li><li> The award is given by friends and colleagues as a form of good-natured ribbing.
</li></ul></li><li> The accidental kind - The award is honestly meant as an honor, but it isn't received as such. There are several possibilities here.
<ul><li> There is an ethical dissonance between the awarder and the awardee. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a>.
</li><li> The awardee takes it as an honor but thinks they don't deserve it. Perhaps the heroic deed was only partially successful, with the awarder taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidEverythingYouCould" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidEverythingYouCould">a positive view</a> and the recipient taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">a negative one</a>.
</li><li> The medal itself is just an eyesore, even if the awarder doesn't think so.
</li><li> The pain of being reminded of the cost of heroism outweighs the satisfaction of being recognized for it.

<ul><li> Smoker of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is <em>furious</em> at the promotion given for Alabasta's salvation when it is the Straw Hat Pirates who were the country's saviors. His participation in it was negligible at best compared to even his immediate subordinate Tashigi. The Government was basically cornered at this point; either cover up the truth with this sham of a medal or openly admit that <em>pirates</em> saved a country from one of their own rogue privateers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, Mu La Flaga is given the nickname "Hawk of Endymion" in honor of his victory in the Endymion Crater on the Moon, namely destroying 5 GINNs with his Mobius ZERO. However, he knows its a formality and he hates the title because the Earth Alliance used it to cover up the fact that the battle ended when they set off a Cyclops System.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MassEffectParagonLost">Mass Effect: Paragon Lost</a></em>, James Vega is awarded a medal for saving critical intelligence on the Collectors and delivering it to the Systems Alliance, but views it as this because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">he had to sacrifice the entire rest of the colony of thousands of people to do it</a>.</span>
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em> omake features the Sanzo-ikkou participating in a local fighting tournament to win some hefty prize cash. However, the prize also comes with a ridiculous "champion costume" that none of them wants. Upon knowing this, finalists Sanzo and Hakkai promptly dropped out from the match, giving the second runner up Gojyo the win. He was understandably pissed by this.
</li><li> Bakugo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> is angry... well, all of the time. But he's especially furious when he's awarded the medal for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> winning the sports festival competition</span>, because the person he beat to get it refused to use their full abilities, making Bakugo feel like he was being cheated and looked down upon.
<ul><li> He was <em>so</em> mad, in fact, he had to be bound and gagged like Hannibal Lecter from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilenceOfTheLambs">Silence of the Lambs</a> to make him even <em>stay</em> on the podium for the award ceremony, and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">All Might</a> <em>tried</em> to put the medal on him he budged his nose and then <em>bit into</em> the medal ribbon so it won't go around his neck, and was still chewing into said ribbon like an angry mad dog when class returned to homeroom that day.

<ul><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em> story staring Huey, Duey, and Louie as the Junior Woodchucks, the trio builds a homemade raft, hoping to score brownie points; unfortunately, they break several safety rules by testing it in a river with rapid water, and quickly find this out for themselves. As they try to steer to safety, a wildfire starts and the other Woodchucks are cut off from the road and blocked by said river, until the raft is jammed between some rocks; everyone is able to escape using it as a makeshift bridge. The scoutmasters debate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifesaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifesaving">whether to punish or reward the trio</a>, until finally coming up with a unique award, the "Doubtful Medallion".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron">X-Wing Rogue Squadron</a></em> comics have Baron Fel, best Imperial pilot since Vader's death, put under the command of an incompetent Admiral with terribly lax morals and no sense of strategy. He gives Fel and Fel's pilots medals, which Fel refuses because he thinks they didn't do anything worth accolades. They flew against Rebel pilots and, close to victory, were suddenly recalled by the admiral when the man saw reports of X-Wings too close for comfort and wanted the protection of his entire force. Fel's pilots accept at the ceremony, and we see that the "starburst" medals were designed by the admiral and are <em>really</em> ugly. Thus, they fall under <em>all three</em> of the "accidental" categories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>: In the Roman Legion, retiring legionnaires were given a parcel of land somewhere in the Empire.

</li><li> In another, the Pointy-Haired Boss gives out rings with precious stones to all the team, noting that they'll get more valuable rings based on their performance, with the highest level being diamond. The next panel has the employees all examining their ring and wondering if Talc counts as a precious stone or not.

<ul><li> <em>Wraith Squadron</em> has character Kell Tainer awarded with the Kalidor Crescent (an award recognizing conspicuous and simultaneous achievements in piloting skill and bravery) for the spectacular maneuver he pulled in an attempt to save his teammate Jesmin Ackbar. Kell inwardly doesn't agree to that and looks like he's going to throw up... because, well, the maneuver actually failed to save Jesmin at all and he was scared out his mind the whole time. Eventually, his friends coax him into realizing the fact that he made the attempt at all and didn't manage to crash his own bird qualified him, even if the lack of success was tragic.

</li><li> Another purposeful type is shown at the Imperial Academy. Cadets are 'awarded' armbands to show that they've been killed or wounded in simulated exercises.

The partner is not happy about the deception because it means that he has to lie to his friends and family about being a hero. However, the audience knows that the partner would have done exactly the same thing as Jamie did if the timing of events was slightly different and his actions that day earned him the medal fair and square.

Meanwhile, People who are Destroying America and the Wag of the Finger portion of Tip/Wag are nearly always an inversion — sarcastic condemnation of people who are noble, courageous, progressive, or at the very least not hurting anyone.

O'Neill would not normally have a problem with this, but just prior to the award ceremony, a reporter who was planning to expose the Stargate program was killed in a convenient car accident and literally died in O'Neill's arms. O'Neill clearly does not think it was an accident and is in no mood to be honored by the organization responsible.

However, Faber knows quite well that the executed men were actually just innocent villagers and the massacre was done purely for political reasons to hide the fact that a SS officer confessed to the assassination. Faber agreed to supervise the executions because a refusal could see him arrested and it gave him the power to reduce the tragedy by limiting the executions to only older adult males rather than the entire population of the village. He considers it a deeply shameful action and the accolades he receives for it trigger a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> and later a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.

He said "Sure, why not?" and the Razzies founder went to Helgeland's office to give it to him. Reportedly he keeps them side by side on his shelf in his office as a reminder of Hollywood's fickleness.

</li><li> <em>Esquire</em> magazine's annual Dubious Achievement Awards. The publishers' decision to discontinue the awards after 2008 was itself regarded as a dubious achievement by many of <em>Esquire</em>'s readers.
</li><li> The Ig Nobel awards are normally not this — they are given out to research that sounds silly but is actually very useful (for example, new insights on structural failure gleaned from research into how a piece of dry spaghetti snaps). However, they are also sometimes given as a criticism, such as the Medicine award that was given to several tobacco company executives who testified under oath that they believed that nicotine was not addictive; the Mathematics award given to Enron, WorldCom et al "for adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world"; Volkswagen's award in chemistry for "solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested"; and the Literature award given to the editors of <em>Social Text</em> due to their part in the infamous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair">Sokal Affair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Most winners who are actual researchers do, in fact, collect their awards at the annual ceremony. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> targets don't.
</li><li> Browse through the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuinnessWorldRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuinnessWorldRecords">Guinness World Records</a></em> book sometime. There are records in there that few people should want to have, such as "Most Facial Prosthetics" or "Largest Kidney Stone". Jonathan Lee Riches, who won the World Record for "most lawsuits" by filing hundreds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuits</a> from prison, <a class="urllink" href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/washington/waedce/2:2009cv00154/47562/">sued the Guinness Book of World Records<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the surprise of absolutely no one.
<ul><li> Guinness ended up having to "retire" quite a few records because they felt they were encouraging people to endanger themselves (or their pets—The category of "fattest pet" was retired under allegations of people purposefully abusing and overfeeding their animals) or for accomplishments that could become illegal in extremes (squick-worthy example being youngest pregnancy).
</li></ul></li><li> Dutch TV used to have a consumer show which gave a golden acorn award (noting that the Dutch word for acorn, <em>eikel</em>, also means <strike>"idiot"</strike> "dickhead") to companies that had particularly poor consumer service. In a subversion of the trope and owing something to the Dutch cultural mindset, these companies' CEOs would often appear in person to accept the award and promise a change for the better.
</li><li> Another popular Dutch show, <em>Kopspijkers</em>, had an award that changed name every season, but was essentially given to the worst thing seen on TV. The evangelical broadcasting station that literally reduced an entire class of children to tears by trashing the gifts they bought for each other to give a rather convoluted message about not having sex before marriage was a memorable winner. So was the dubious but famous medium, who was displeased with the host and said that she was receiving the number 10 from the other side. Said host later left the left-wing public broadcasting station for a billionaire's pet project channel named Talpa, originally named Ten. His career never really recovered from that move. Huh, guess the other side is pretty vengeful.
</li><li> The Purple Heart medal receives a mixed welcome from various members of the American military. Some see it as rewarding failure, while others see it as proof that you're willing to put your life on the line. Some recipients jokingly refer to it as the "Enemy Marksmanship Medal". Most would nonetheless probably personally favor not ever being eligible to receive the medal (which is to say, not get harmed in combat).
<ul><li> Similarly, the Prisoner of War Medal was debated in the United States for over a decade before it was established, as some felt that receiving an award for being captured was shameful and embarrassing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1c5g7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1c5g7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1c5g7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">some people</a> prefer those who weren't captured.</span> However, it was ultimately passed, awarded to anybody taken prisoner in a combat situation (later expanded to also include being taken hostage by terrorists) and who behaved honorably in captivity, retroactive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">April 5, 1917</a>. Like the Purple Heart (which can also be awarded to anybody injured while in enemy captivity), it shows that the recipient went into harm's way.
</li></ul></li><li> There have occasions of people getting military medals despite not having earned them. The objective is to avoid admitting a mistake was made or the military needs good publicity. This often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> in communist nation-states.
<ul><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state">communist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-party_state">single-party nation-states<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> often overlaps with this. While every society can fall victim to political awards, non-democratic nations are more likely to give medals and orders that promote loyalty to the state.

</li></ul></li><li> Members of the US Army's Officer Candidate School elect one candidate "most expendable".
</li><li> In Great Britain, patriots and early feminists shamed men into joining the army by awarding them a white feather as a symbol of cowardice. Although the practice dates back to the 18th century, this was most prevalent during World War I when the Order of the White Feather was formed to have women present men not in uniform with feathers. The campaign wasn't popular among soldiers due to public servants, veterans, and men on leave often being handed feathers by mistake. A few men were even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by the shame.
</li><li> Each graduating class at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">West Point</a> "awards" its lowest-ranked cadet the dubious honor of being "the goat." Additionally, each cadet (usually around 1000 or so) in the class donates a dollar to the goat, so at least he or she gets something out of it. Funnily enough, in sports and hip-hop nomenclature, the term "GOAT" has the exact opposite meaning, used as an acronym for "Greatest Of All Time".

The player is also awarded the title "Mr. Irrelevant" and invited to Newport Beach for a parade and humiliating roast.
<ul><li> Ironically, as most teams use those late-round picks to select players best suited for Special Teams needs, whoever gets tabbed "Mr. Irrelevant" might actually garner a decent career in the league. <a class="urllink" href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/where-are-they-now-catching-up-with-20-different-mr-irrelevant-draft-picks">Check out the list of notable "winners"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

A "1st prize" likewise existed if the storyboard was approved.
</li><li> Interesting, even the biggest awards in a field can become this. There are certain awards from the big award shows that some people are a little suspicious of because of a track record that they might be cursed. A couple:
<ul><li> Best New Artist at the Grammys: The award is notorious for its completely erratic track record. You either go to soaring new heights or you completely disappear from the public eye. Almost every Best New Artist winner is asked afterward if they're worried about the curse. More specifically, the 1990 award, which was awarded to Milli Vanilli and was later revoked. They had planned to give the award to one of the other nominees (Neneh Cherry, the Indigo Girls, Soul II Soul, or Tone Lōc), but none of them wanted it.
</li><li> Best Supporting Actor and Actress at the Oscars: Louis Gossett Jr. said, after his win, that he felt it was something of a double-edged sword. While he did have an Oscar to his credit, he said he felt like he was trapped in a strange gray area where smaller productions don't think they can afford you (since you're an Oscar winner) and big productions don't think you can carry a film on your own (since you're a Supporting Actor.) They also have a similar hit and miss record as Best New Artist, with winners such as Brenda Fricker and Mercedes Ruehl virtually disappearing afterwards.
</li><li> Most "Car of the Year" awards are similarly erratic. The Simca 1308 beat out the first BMW 3-series for the 1976 European COTY, for instance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/People" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/People">People</a></em> magazine puts out annual Best and Worst Dressed lists, the latter supposed to be this Trope. Sometimes a subversion, with some second and third Worst Dressed recipients often expression public displeasure at not having the number one spot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a> really loved medals of this type. In 1709, he "awarded" (in absentia) an "Order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousJudas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousJudas">Judas</a>" to Ukrainian hetman Ivan Mazepa for betraying him and siding with Swedish king <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex">Charles XII</a>. In 1714, he introduced the <a class="urllink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Za_pjanstvo.jpg">Drunk Medal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, a huge chunk of cast iron (weighing between 9 and 18 pounds), to be worn for a week as a punishment for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski">Vodka Drunkenski</a>.
</li><li> When Finland ended up fighting alongside Nazi Germany to recover territory lost to the Soviet Union during the Winter War, their ranks included Jewish officers. Some of them received the Iron Cross, one of Nazi Germany's highest awards, which they all told the Nazis where to stick.
</li><li> The Bad Sex In Fiction Prize, awarded annually by <em>Literary Review</em> to the writer who has produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IkeaErotica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IkeaErotica">the worst sex scene</a> in literature that year. A notable nomination in 2010 (though not the eventual 'winner') was a passage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a>'s memoirs about sex with his wife on the night after his predecessor as Labour Party Leader died; the nomination was a double insult to Blair, implying not only bad writing on his part but also dishonesty in the rest of the book, as it bears repeating, this prize is an award for bad sex in <em>fiction</em>.
</li><li> SF fandom has (or had) the Hogu Awards, a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward">Hugo Awards</a> with such categories as Worst Fanzine Title, Best New Feud, Most Desired Gafication (or in non-fanspeak, the person the voters would most like to leave fandom - in a bonus parody of the Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund that sends British fans to the US and vice versa, the winner of this award is said to be eligible for the <em>Mid</em>-Atlantic Fan Fund) and Special Devo Award for Harm to Science Fiction. The Hugo is a statuette of a space rocket on a wooden plinth; the Hogu is a wooden plinth with a scorch mark on top.
</li><li> The Golden Poo from consumer-awareness website <em>The Consumerist</em> is given to the "Worst Company in America," as selected by site voters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> got the dubious honor (along with the resulting hit in stock and the need to send CEO John Riccitiello <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">packing</a>) two years in a row back in 2012 and 2013, and Bank of America has been a contender for the award ever since the website has been running the contest.
</li><li> "Most Improved" awards at school are often treated with embarrassment by students since they imply that you weren't very good to begin with.
<ul><li> Similarly, any "Participant" trophy can smack of this, as it's simply a "Thanks for showing up!" award.
</li><li> Some real trophies can come across as this if the competition pool is small enough. Third place is normally a notable accomplishment... except when only three people show up to compete in that category. If only one person shows up, it also overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">Overly Narrow Superlative</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Italian football has Bidone d'oro, the golden trashcan, which is given to the "worst" player in Serie A. This award has only been given to top club players, so it's really closer to biggest disappointment. France also has Ballon de Plomb, the lead ball, for the most disappointing player in Ligue 1.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a> awards the Red Lantern (La Lanterne Rouge) to the rider who came in last. The award is named after the red light that used to shine on the rearmost car of a train. Cyclists who fell hopelessly behind on the race would actually compete with each other for this award, as "winning" would at least get your name in the papers, and get you invited criteriums, which could be rather lucrative. Not to mention that winning the Red Lantern means at least the cyclist <em>finished</em> the race, which given the overall distance of 3500 kilometers many participants fail to do.

</li></ul></li><li> Cambridge University students who graduated with a "third-class honour" (the lowest passing grade for an honour's degree program) were once given a wooden spoon. The spoon got bigger and bigger with every passing year, and by the time they banned it in the early 1900s, the thing was two metres long.
<ul><li> In many sports, the team that finishes in last place on the ladder/table at the end of a season is said to have won the wooden spoon.
</li></ul></li><li> Each year, the French soccer magazine <em>France Football</em> awards the "Golden Ball" (Ballon d'Or) to the best player in the world over the season. And each year, the French satirical site <em>Les Cahiers du Football</em> responds by awarding the "Lead Ball" (Ballon de Plomb) to the worst player of the French soccer league. Some awardees take it better than others. They also reward the "Lead Mic" (Micro de Plomb) to the worst soccer commentator on French Television − and there is <em>serious</em> competition on that one.

</li><li> School yearbooks sometimes go with this with the "Most Likely To" categories. While most of the awards tend to be the usual "Most Likely To Succeed" type awards, some yearbook committees can parody the concept with stuff like "Most Likely To End Up In Prison" or "Strangest Haircut." Others are a deliberate joke poking fun at a particular student's quirks, like a Civil War buff being voted "Most Likely To Secede."

</li><li> In the medieval era, knights who screw up big time would be forced to add an <em>abatement</em> to their personal coat of arms. And the knight and his descendants would be forced to carry the "stained" shield until the Court of Heraldry and the monarch see fit to remove it. Different crimes result in different abatements so that everyone on the battlefield would know what you did, and react accordingly. Or at least, that's how the romanticized Victorian view of the matter goes; the only heraldic abatement definitively known to have been used was turning the coats of arms of convicted traitors upside down, usually on a paper surcoat they were forced to wear while being paraded to their place of execution.
</li><li> On Dutch television, there's an annual award ceremony for the best TV advertisement, the Gouden Loeki (Golden Loeki, after the animated lion that served as the mascot for the national advertisement broadcasting foundation). Its counterpart is the Loden Leeuw (Lead Lion), for the year's most annoying ad.
</li><li> The movie poster website impawards.com has an annual tradition where they vote for both the best and worst posters of the year in several categories and genres. There's also a third section, not part of the official picks, where they award various tongue-in-cheek prizes for things like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">Best Review From a Dead Dictator</a> Award" or "Least Romantic Poster for a Romance Movie".
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://covercafe.com/contest.shtml">Annual Romance Cover Contest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> includes a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover">worst cover</a>" category. There's been at least one case of an author <em>lobbying for her own book</em> in this category as a way of pointing out her lack of input on the art.
</li><li> At one Felix Award ceremony (Felix Award being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec">Quebec</a>'s version of the Grammys), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion">Céline Dion</a> was awarded <em>Best English-Speaking Artist</em> given that she just began her successful streak in the English market after having spent her early years singing only to French markets. She said in her speech that the title <em>English-Speaking Artist</em> doesn't suit her (owing to her Francophone roots) and thus she rejected the award. This apparently caused that particular category to be subsequently known as <em>Most successful artist performing in a language other than French</em>.
</li><li> In Germany exists a <em>extremely</em> persistent rumor that if you manage to receive your Abitur (Highschool Graduation certificate) with exactly 4.0 (the worst mark possible since a 4.1 means you failed), you would win a car. It is unclear where the rumor originates from, but bad students are infamous for attempting to at least get the 4.0 for this reason. Considering that the student needs to get <strong>exactly</strong> 280 points (5 points in each course), it is needless to say that most candidates not only don't get a car but also no certificate.
</li><li> The French <em>Légion d'Honneur</em> has become this for some people. Created by Napoléon in 1802, it was initially the greatest honorific distinction, awarded to those who achieve great service for France. Nowadays though, it is better known as "the award of the President's friends", given away to people who didn't do much to deserve it (including the Prince of Saudi Arabia). As such, it is often refused by people who either don't want to be associated with the government in any way or reject the idea of that award entirely.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud">Iznogoud</a> Award is granted to the French official who has perpetrated the year's most high-profile failure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye">Private Eye</a></em> bestows the Order of the Brown Nose (OBN) upon people who engage in egregious sycophantic praise. There are also three annual awards or sets thereof announced at Christmas or New Year:
<ul><li> The <em>Nooks and Corners</em> architecture columnist "Piloti" awards the Sir Hugh Casson Medal for the Worst New Building of the year. (It's named after an architect whom Piloti despised because in his later years he routinely took a fee to give evidence in favour of demolishing worthwhile buildings.)
</li><li> <em>Rotten Boroughs</em>, the local government column, presents a set of awards to local councillors, senior council staff, etc. that it has reported on throughout the year. The categories vary from year to year but have included e.g. "Tory Bigot of the Year", "Jailbird of the Year" and "Nepotism Award".
</li><li> The <em>Literary Review</em> column presents the Christmas Log-Rolling Awards for the most blatant examples of log-rolling (i.e. writers trading favours by praising each other's books) and other such disreputable practices in newspapers' and magazines' "book of the year" pieces.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/05/26/texas-junior-high-student-gets-most-likely-to-become-a-terroris/22111238/">This story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> proves that this sort of thing is <em>not</em> as funny in reality than in fiction. (To make it even worse, the "award" was given right after the terrorist attack in Manchester, Great Britain, where 22 people were killed.)
</li><li> While not intentionally handed out, one dubious yet frequent occurrence at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> is the phenomenon of a country somehow not receiving points from any of the other countries. As an inverse to the famous "douze points" (12 points) awarded to a country's top pick, this distinction (as coined by longtime British commentator Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TerryWogan">Terry Wogan</a>) is referred to as "nul points" (this, of course, is not proper French, but leave us not pick at straws). Thirty-eight songs over the years have received it.
<ul><li> This wasn't an uncommon phenomenon in the contest's early years. Given a voting system that only favored a country's top five, this left many songs that weren't necessarily bad, but couldn't quite finish in the top five, to languish. At least one country received <em>nul points</em> every year from 1962 to 1967. In fact, from 1962 to 1965, four countries each year shared last place. Notable occurrences include 1963 (where almost every Nordic country received <em>nul points</em>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Sweden</a>, along with the Netherlands - the one major exception being Denmark, who won the whole thing with a fair deal of support from their Nordic neighbors), 1964 (where Portugal became the first country to score <em>nul points</em> for their debut entry), and 1966 (where one of the two recipients was Italian singer Domenico Modugno, responsible for two stone-cold Eurovision classics in "Volare" and "Piove (Ciao, ciao, bambina);" it was also the sole <em>nul points</em> for both Italy and Monaco).
</li><li> Following a similar fate for usually-successful Luxembourg in 1970, precautions were taken to ensure no country could finish that low again. A system from 1971 to 1973 required juries to award points to every song that year, so while a country could still come in last, it was never with nothing (as poor Malta found out when their first two entries both bottomed out the scoreboard). Then 1975 saw the introduction of the 12 points system that's more or less been used in variations ever since. People thought <em>nul points</em> were still basically a thing of the past...until 1978. That was when Norway sent singer/comedian Jahn Teigen and his song "Mil etter mil" to represent them in Paris, France. Apparently disgruntled at the way his song had been arranged for the contest (loud and brassy as opposed to the smooth country-rock tune he intended), Teigen decided that if that's the way his song was to be played, he'd perform accordingly. And thus, we got <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVj8tlXQ1Vg">this masterpiece<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a perfect storm of bizarre choices regarding performance, vocalization, and, er, wardrobe, with a hefty dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> on top of it all. It ended the night with nothing, making Teigen something of a Eurovision folk hero (and, indeed, he competed on two more occasions), but that would've been the end of it. Until...
</li><li> 1981 saw Norway once again bottom out the scoreboard with <em>nul points</em>, this time for folk singer Finn Kalvik and his composition "Aldri i livet." A fairly chintzy number (despite production assistance from Bjorn Ulvaeus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>), its fate combined with that of Teigen and Anita Thallaug (who scored <em>nul points</em> under the old system in '63) established Norway as the "<em>nul points</em> country," which took Norway some time (and a win in 1985) to shake off (to a degree, but that's for later).
</li><li> 1982 to 1983 saw more countries take <em>nul points</em>, with Finland's punk song "Nuku pomiin" by Kojo doing so in 1982 and the double whammy of Spain's "Quien maneja mi barca" by Remedios Amaya (an intense, let's charitably say interestingly-sung flamenco number) and Turkey's "Opera" by Cetin Alp and the Short Waves (what do you think it sounds like?) doing so in 1983. After a few more charitable years, the same fate once again befell Turkey's Seyyal Taner in 1987, Austria's Wilfried in 1988, Iceland's Daniel in 1989, and (once again) Austria's Thomas Forstner in 1991. Wilfried's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fKcQb3ZEG4">"Lisa Mona Lisa"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was voted by Eurovision fans to be the worst song to receive <em>nul points</em> in 2003. (For what it's worth, Remedios Amaya was deemed the best).
</li><li> There were sporadic occurrences throughout the rest of the '90s. Lithuania, one of seven debuting (largely Eastern European) countries in 1994, scored <em>nul points</em> for their first-ever entry (a distinction it shares with Portugal), leading them to withdraw until 1999. 1997 saw two countries do so, one being Portugal and the other being - you guessed it! - Norway, a year after a highly successful hosting gig in Oslo. Switzerland's Gunvor, who by the time of the contest had become a Swiss tabloid fixture, worsened her hometown reputation by earning <em>nul points</em> in 1998. That was that for a few years, until...
</li><li> 2003 saw a triple whammy for the United Kingdom's ill-fated Jemini and "Cry Baby." It was the first British entry to finish last, the first British song to score <em>nul points</em>, and the first English-language song to receive no points (also, it remains the only Eurovision performance on this very site's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">So Bad, It's Horrible</a> page for music). The duo blamed several causes for their failure, including non-functioning monitors preventing them from hearing the backing track (and therefore starting the song in the wrong key, which they barely recovered from before the end of the song), and - in relation to that - sabotage by other contestants. Terry Wogan believed it may have been a result of "post-Iraq backlash," but the common counterpoint was that the song just kinda stunk.
</li><li> The introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 should theoretically have made <em>nul points</em> even harder to achieve, as now most countries have to earn their place in the final as opposed to just being there by virtue of their score the previous year. However, the very first year of the semi-final saw Switzerland earn <em>nul points</em> for Piero and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicStars">Music Stars</a>' "Celebrate" (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUX3_0KM7fc">here's why - proceed with caution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and 2009 saw the Czech Republic's Gipsy.cz and "Aven Romale" also finish their semi-final with nothing, leading them to withdraw until 2015. And speaking of that year...
</li><li> 2015 is the last year to date where a country has finished with <em>nul points</em> in the final...or, as it should happen, two countries. Austria and Germany's infamous mutual Eurovision hate-crush combined with nothing from the other juries meant that both Austria's Makemakes and Germany's Ann Sophie ended the night with <em>nul points.</em> This made Austria the first host country to finish with no points (not the first to finish last on home ground - the Netherlands did it in 1958 and Portugal would do it in 2018), as well as tying it with Norway and Switzerland as the country to most frequently receive the dreaded score. Interestingly, Austria isn't officially listed as finishing last, despite its shared lack-of-score: due to current tie-break rules, ties are broken by placing the country that performed earlier over the country that performed later, so Germany is officially listed as finishing last. No country has finished with <em>nul points</em> overall ever since, although one song has received no points from the jury vote (Spain's 2017 entry) and two songs have received no points from the televote (The Czech Republic in 2016 and Austria in 2017). It has also appeared in the semi-finals several times: 2017 saw no televote points for Malta and no jury points for San Marino, while most recently, 2018 saw Iceland pick up no televote points.
</li></ul></li><li> The French <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat&lt;!--C3--&gt;A9gorie:G&lt;!--C3--&gt;A9rard">Gérard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>award is essentially their version of the Razzie awards (and a parody of the César movie trophies, but where a César is a golden statuette, a Gérard is a cinderblock), given as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to politicians and TV/movie stars with highly evocative categories like:
<ul><li> "Gérard for Talking So Much About How Well He Did As A Local Elected Official That You Want To Tell Him To Stay In His Dump Of A Backwater"
</li><li> "Gérard for Best Presidential Bootlicker And When We Say Boots It's A Euphemism"

</li><li> "Gérard for Best Singer Who's Gone Into Acting, Or The Other Way Around, In Any Case He's Bad At It"
</li><li> "Gérard for Best Movie Where It's Explained To You That Racism Is Bad"
</li></ul></li><li> As of January 2019, British Conservative Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheresaMay">Theresa May</a> has two dubious honours of overseeing the biggest ever defeat for a democratic government in the Commons (for her Brexit deal, 432 noes to 202 ayes, a difference of 230) and being the first government in British history to be held in contempt in parliament (for defying a vote to release legal documents related to Brexit).
</li><li> Since January 2014, the hosts of the British TV show <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastLeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastLeg">The Last Leg</a></em> has presented the Dick of the Year award to the person who is voted to have been the biggest dick of the previous year. They have also attempted to actually give the golden dick trophy to some of their winners - leading to a highly amusing video of UK politician Jeremy Hunt trying to avoid getting the trophy handed to him. Previous winners of the award include Russian President Vladimir Putin, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, the aforementioned Jeremy Hunt, the year 2016, US president Donald Trump, UK politician Jacob Rees-Mogg, and UK prime minister Boris Johnson. Notable runners-up include Donald Trump (two times, although he was a major factor in "2016" winning before he actually won it in 2017), pre-premiership Boris Johnson (the year before he won the award), Rees-Mogg (the year after he won), former UK prime minister David Cameron, former UK prime minister Theresa May (twice), Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, Australian politician Bob Katter, UK chancellor Phillip Hammond, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, political commentator Piers Morgan, cricketer Steve Smith (who was accused of ball-tampering), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em> villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>, Prince Andrew (after he got engulfed in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal), the Chinese government (during the midst of the Hong Kong protests), Rebekah Vardy, the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy (because of her Instagram feud with the wife of Wayne Rooney), and the controversial Video Assistant Referee system that was introduced in UK football.
<ul><li> The show also has the "Katie Hopkins rule" that nominees for the award is not to be seen as a compliment, disqualifying pundit Hopkins in 2014 and disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fmla');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fmla" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fmla');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this was the year he was outed as a sexual predator, and the award could be interpreted as referring to his penis</span> (who was instead awarded the "Steaming Turd for Lifetime Achievement") on that basis. Former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em> writer Graham Linehan was the runaway audience nominee in 2019 for being an unrepentant transphobe but was similarly disqualified after saying he would go on the show to accept it.
