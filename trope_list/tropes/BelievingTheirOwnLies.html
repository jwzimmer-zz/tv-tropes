With all the people cheering for him, he has a tendency to get swept up in the moment and actually believe he can take on the likes of Cell before he remembers that no, he really can't.
</li><li> In the anime/manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em>, Rajendra dramatically broke down in tears at his father's funeral. The scene appeared to be a bit too melodramatic to be not planned but Narsus believed the prince's tears are genuine. Rajendra had played the role of a loving son for so long, he ended up believing it.
</li><li> The manga-only arc Onisarashi-hen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> has Natsumi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stating to the police that her mother killed her grandmother, then, after hiding the body, stabbed her father in the back of the neck for being incompetent and useless, then killing herself by slashing her throat open with a knife that she tried to kill Natsumi with.</span> In chapter 7, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">we find out that</a> it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Natsumi</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe">committed all of the murders</a>; she killed her grandmother, then got her parents to help hide her, stabbed her father in the front of his neck, and then killed her mother after she called for help when Akira called the house.</span>

While knowing that, in the Sky Islands, "God" is merely a title for an island's leader, Eneru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Lightning-based Rumble-Rumble Fruit powers</a> combined with the near-omnipotence granted by his enhanced mind-reading Mantra ability convinced him that he truly <em>was</em> divine.

This hit a critical mass when it emerged <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he once served on the Pirate King's ship, alongside one of the current Four Emperors.</span> As a result, he started thinking he had a chance of taking Whitebeard's head. To put that in perspective, Buggy is on the low end of <em>One Piece's</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>, and Whitebeard is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a> with zero exaggeration.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlotte Pudding</span> is one of Big Mom's top agents and children. This child is a master actor and able to sway both men and women into loving and respecting them.

In the end, he's in a tight spot where only manifesting actual psychokinesis can save him, and he believes so hard he actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessHallucinations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessHallucinations">hallucinates that it's working</a>.

<ul><li> In an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> story, Veronica tells Archie and Reggie that whoever scores the most baskets in the next school game gets to take her out that weekend. Reggie attempts to sabotage Archie by telling him that the best way to improve his basket-shooting is to criticize himself constantly and harshly while practicing. This goes Reggie's way until Coach Clayton sets Archie straight, telling him that he should do the opposite while practicing and build up his confidence. Archie indeed goes on to score the most baskets, leading Reggie to wonder whether there was something to his "advice" after all. The story ends with Reggie practicing while berating himself and surrounding himself with demotivational posters.

One issue of The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin Series</a></em> had him actually in tears as he told the psychiatrist of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive childhood</a>, only for the psychiatrist to coldly point out that it's the <em>seventh</em> story he's told now.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> <em>actually believes</em> that he is fighting to protect humanity from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>.

</li><li> Judas Traveller from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> was a guy with apparently limitless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping">Reality Warping</a> powers who claimed to be a near-godlike immortal sorcerer. It eventually turned out he was a former psychologist with a psychic ability to make people believe things ... himself included.
</li><li> A recurring theme in IDW's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> comics:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Onyx Prime</a> was initially a brave warrior and crusader who could bring the rest of the Thirteen Primes down from their storytelling and blind idealism. Then Alpha Trion pointed out to him how stories could be used to inspire people; Onyx decided to try that out and began making up stories about himself, the other Thirteen, and their allies. At some point he started believing his own propaganda and devolved into a total egomaniac, partly leading to the first major war on Cybertron.
</li><li> Alpha Trion later argues that <em>all</em> of the Thirteen did this and he has a good point. We're shown that Nexus Prime died because when Galvatron came to kill him, he responded by spouting nonsense about how "only a Prime can kill a Prime". It was blatantly untrue, but Nexus seemed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">genuinely think he was immortal</a>, not bothering to defend himself or flee at all. Galvatron killed him with one shot.

<ul><li> The Olivia Goldsmith novel <em>The Bestseller</em> has Daniel and Judith writing a crime novel (Judith actually doing most of the work as she's a far better writer) but, to sell it properly, Daniel takes on the identity of "Jude Daniel", the sole author. The plan is to wait until the book is published to reveal the truth but Daniel is soon seduced, first by his editor, then by the New York publishing lifestyle, loving the acclaim of a supposed bestseller, the big advance paydays, and parties. This takes its toll on his marriage to a pregnant Judith and during a huge fight, Judith realizes Daniel honestly has convinced himself that he alone wrote the book, she contributed barely anything and he'll fight her in court. It's all moot as the book turns into a massive bomb, Daniel gets the blame and his standing in New York plummets as he's already blown through most of the advance money and quit his job. The novel ends with Judith ready to publish a sure hit while Daniel is left drifting in a bad teaching job.

The good guys don't ever really come up with a fully satisfactory answer, but they do sway a few of the Ori's followers by demonstrating that while the Ori have the <em>power</em> of gods, they certainly don't behave like the loving and benevolent overlords they claim to be.

The "captain", Tim Watters, believes that it is their destiny to make their mark on the Dominion War and seek to do so by attacking a prototype Jem'Hadar ship and the crew follow along, believing him. This is despite the fact that they're just a group of cadets that had their training cruise interrupted by the start of the Dominion War and some of them would rather just go home.
</li><li> The 1989 mini-series <em>Twist of Fate</em> has SS Colonel Helmut von Schrader on the run after taking part in a failed attempt to kill Hitler. In desperation, he has himself surgically altered and hides as Jewish prisoner Benjamin Grossman. Circumstances cause Grossman to eventually become a well-known hero in Israel and marrying a Jewish woman. 25 years after the war, a couple of his former SS buddies track him down in Argentina. They mention that Grossman's son, Danny, is doing a documentary that "perpetuates the Jewish Holocaust hoax." Grossman's face makes it clear he can't believe what's crazier: That the former Nazis are claiming the Holocaust never happened to each other; or that they're saying this to a man who was not only a <em>prisoner</em> of such a camp but <em>helped run one himself.</em>

When an Immortal declares that the best thing he can do in the name of his vow to one of the protagonists is absolutely nothing, he waits to see if there's any effect before being glad he believes his own hype.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Katamari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Katamari">Katamari</a></em>, Ace is completely convinced that the Prince is a prideful, selfish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> who'll do whatever it takes to come out on top.

And then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">gophers</a> that Minos threw with his super-strength start falling from the sky.

<ul><li> This was one of the critical flaws of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Miko Miyazaki</a>. She was fundamentally incapable of seeing herself in the wrong, and would frequently convince herself of whatever she had to in order to keep it that way even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the gods themselves strip her of all of her powers as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">paladin</a> in response to her killing of Lord Shojo</span>.

Yet he seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">genuinely believe in his own cover identity as a hero</a>, claiming to be a good guy even when directly confronted with evidence to the contrary and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">seeing good fortune as a personal reward from the gods for his bravery</a>.
</li><li> Master Shake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompulsiveLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompulsiveLiar">Compulsive Liar</a> and also has a loose grip on reality. Often he'll make up lies for his own benefit, then start acting as if they were true. In "Bus of the Undead", he completely makes up a story about how the school bus parked outside the Aqua Teen's house is "a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">reverse vampire</a>" and "possessed by the ghost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a>," because he was watching <em>Assisted Living Dracula</em> at the time. Despite the fact that this is entirely his own invention, he proceeds to operate throughout the rest of the episode as if everything he made up was real, to the point where he runs screaming back into the house after a failed attempt to "drive this stake deep into the heart of the crankcase of the vampire bus."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em>: A psychologist could have a field day with Mr. Peanutbutter on this one.
<ul><li> He believes himself to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> whose natural talent, charisma and good attitude earns him numerous gigs and scores in his business. Not only is he a complete covert cad with no idea of how to handle his PB Livin brand beyond obtaining rights for meaningless projects, funding asinine ideas and spending money without earning revenue; his idiocy and tactless behavior is what keeps him getting acting jobs since its fused with his fun-loving, clean side.
</li><li> He picks up women who he thinks are just as free-thinking and cheerful as he is......ignoring the fact theyre way younger than him, making him a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>, and his immaturity compared to them makes him the odd dog out when they outgrow and leave him. Furthermore, his assumption he just dates women with these features leaves him ignorant of his subconscious superficial nature by being unwilling to date someone his age.
</li><li> He thinks he and BoJack are friends and he respects him very much. While this is just self-denial (BoJack is not subtle in his contempt), it speaks volumes of his self-delusion that hes kept this belief for more than 20 years, and is genuinely hurt that BoJack isn't familiar with the show that made him famous. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfOnlyYouKnew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfOnlyYouKnew">"It's like you didn't even watch my show."</a>)
</li><li> He thinks believing in yourself and having a good disposition is all that's needed to be successful at life. Partly, yes, but this is only because thats what has worked for him in a town like Hollywoo and he believes it's the same for everyone.
</li><li> He insists he's a good boss even though he's willing to ignore their desires and needs if it inconveniences him.
</li><li> In a more specific instance, in Season 1 he stole credit from BoJack for the Hollywoo Heist. By the next episode he seemed to genuinely believe he did it.
</li><li> In Season 6, he becomes "the face of depression" across America when he claims to have depression after a public "incident" where Mr. Peanutbutter was supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>. Though that was because Princess Carolyn pushed him in front of a moving car, which was going maybe five miles per hour. In any case, the driver saw Mr. Peanutbutter in plenty of time, and stopped before their car even touched him. After going on a long tour for depression, Mr. Peanutbutter seems to genuinely believe he's depressed, and that his happiness is just a mask. And it <em>sort of</em> is already, but not the way he thinks it is.

Fry and Leela use this to their advantage to terrify them with outrageous threats and escape.

</li><li> Angelica of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> usually torments the younger babies by lying to them about some mundane thing to make it seem terrifying. Correspondingly, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">comeuppance</a> often involves circumstances making her think she was right:
<ul><li> "Rhinoceritis!": After tricking Chuckie into thinking a disease she made up is turning him into a rhino, a horn-shaped bump on her head, along with gray-colored scabs on her legs, leads her to think that <em>she</em> has contracted "rhinoceritis".
</li><li> "Chicken Pops": After all the babies come down with chickenpox, Angelica convinces them that they'll all turn into actual chickens. By the end of the episode, she herself has contracted the pox, and when an egg falls into her car seat, she freaks out and believes that she's turning into a chicken herself.
</li><li> In the episode aptly titled "The Sky is Falling" She tried to convince the babies that the sky is falling, and ends up believing it herself after a stray tennis ball falls on her head.
</li><li> "Hand Me Downs": Stu and Didi give Tommy's old toys to Dil, and Angelica tells Tommy that once his parents give all of his old stuff to Dil, he'll disappear. In the end, Susie explains that a person doesn't disappear from giving away hand-me-downs. Angelica <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">expresses her thankfulness on being an only child, and thus gets to keep all of her stuff</a>. But then Drew comes by and tells her that he and Charlotte have decided to give all of her old stuff to Tommy. This causes Angelica to scream in fear that <em>she'll</em> disappear once her parents give all of her old stuff to Tommy.
</li><li> "Down the Drain": After an incident where Tommy accidentally loses one of his toys down the drain, Angelica scares Tommy and Chuckie by saying they could suffer the same fate. Throughout the episode, they try to find ways to get out of it, which includes flushing anything bath time related down the toilet. Ironically, she accidentally flushes her own doll, Cynthia, down the toilet. The plumber recovers it, but the doll is ruined.

Eventually, he starts claiming he was the only one who wrote the joke while Jimmy was the one on the couch, and each time the story is told, he adds an increasingly outlandish event to it. It turns out he really does believe his own lies.
</li><li> In "Jewpacabra", Cartman spreads vicious rumors about a Hebrew-based monster attacking at Easter. Somewhere along the way, Cartman starts to believe his own story, hiding in fear of being attacked.

Unfortunately, Patrick takes it too seriously and soon ends up believing that he truly is a genius and SpongeBob really is dumb.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>, Knuckles starts bragging that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">he defeated Eggman by himself, won over the girls, and was elected governor while Sonic cowardly ran away</a>.

Taken to ludicrous extremes in "The Super Shredder," where he rants at Splinter for supposedly turning Karai against him and brainwashing her, which is <em>exactly</em> what Shredder has done her entire life, and in a more literal sense with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">brain worms</a> a season before. He goes so far as to swear that he <em>saw</em> Splinter kill Tang Shen with his own eyes.
