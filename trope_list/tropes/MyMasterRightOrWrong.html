</p><p>The trope is mostly used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">vaguely medieval settings</a>. Feudalism, after all, is based on <em>personal</em> obligations to a liege-lord (in other structures, the loyalty is more impersonal, usually based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">a community or an ideology</a>). The underling usually is a minor noble of a warrior caste, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant">knight</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">samurai</a> or such.
</p><p>To make certain that the public understands that this character is not following out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience">Blind Obedience</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">sadism</a> and in fact disagrees, he will get a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments, appeal to his liege to re-think a decision, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSpareHimMyLiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSpareHimMyLiege">beg for the lives of others</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">angst</a> visibly when he's alone, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion">try to twist his orders a little if possible</a>. He often doesn't even consider the heroes his enemy and is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">honorable opponent</a>. Also, he might be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">suffering as much under his lord as the next subject, for sympathy points</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>These types tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a> who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">sworn an oath</a> to unreliable leaders and refuse to break their word. Such characters are prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> because all they need is to broaden their ethic horizon a bit. It's also popular for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>, presenting feudal ideals and showing the modern public how an obviously compassionate man can be made to freely follow obviously cruel orders. (However, their actions can also be interpreted as the way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>: their goal is clear, remaining loyal to their master and doing whatever they want, ranging from recycling garbage to mass genocide, even though their hearts may not be into it).
</p><p>If The Heroes call someone out for playing this trope, he might attempt to justify this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>.
</p><p>Of course, in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">real</a> feudal systems, trying to force a vassal to act dishonorably—or making him jeopardize the value of the land-grant that secured his service in the first place, e.g. by overworking his serfs—could jeopardize his vassalage itself. In "High" Medieval Western Europe, also, a vassal could hardly be said to have a "master"; vassals were obligated to <em>show up</em> with troops when their liege asked, and stay for a term (usually 90 days or so). After that term, they could leave, and while they were obligated to generally assist their liege they were (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">in theory</a>) their liege's equals—hence why nobles are called "peers"—and thus <em>didn't</em> have to take orders, so battle-planning involved negotiations over who would do what.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This deals with such questions as: What is an oath worth? What are wrong and right, personal mercy or abstract principles? What is honor? The liege is evil, how evil is the vassal?
</p><p>Liege and vassal are great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foils</a> for each other and for the relationship of a leading hero and his followers.
</p><p>Especially tragic when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">vassal is also more competent than the liege</a>. Very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a>, only more personal.

Not out of his clear contempt, anger, or hate, but as his second.
</li><li> Allen Walker of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> may fit this trope to a point. He is our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>, who loves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">wants to save everyone, even Akuma</a>. Two of his comrades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech">have scolded him about his naive attitude</a>. His master is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Cross Marian</a>. Cross is one of the protagonists, and seems to be on the side of saving humanity and ending the Holy War. But he is not above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a> now and again to accomplish a goal, or to get more favorable results. Allen comes face-to-face with Apocryphos, a sentient Innocence who is responsible for attempting to assassinate his master. As far as Allen knew, his master had been killed. When he finds out about Apocyphos' attack on his master, he attacks him in rage. Apocyphos tells Allen that Cross was just using him as a sacrifice to awaken the 14th Noah -while attempting to merge with him. Allen just replies that he is Cross Marian's apprentice, and that the thought of merging with the one who killed his master makes him want to puke.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> MetalGarurumon challenges WarGreymon to a fight on Yamato's orders. He even pretty much says this trope, though it was more like "my friend needs to know <em>somebody's</em> on his side, so it's gotta be this way."
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, Wormmon has this approach to the Digimon Emperor. Unusually for this trope, the Digimon Emperor has nothing but contempt for him, but when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">sacrifices himself</a> to save the Emperor's life, it prompts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>.
</li><li> Renamon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is this in the early part of the series. She kept a soldier-like nobility despite being treated as a soulless fighting machine by her Tamer, and it's eventually revealed that <em>Renamon</em> chose <em>Ruki</em> and not the other way around. Both had to undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and learn there was more to life than becoming stronger, but it didn't happen to them at the same time or in the same way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield">Gaomon</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> is depicted as <em>very</em> servile to his partner; "Sir, yes sir!" can be his entire dialogue in some episodes, and in the Japanese version, his catchphrase was "Yes, Master." However, when his partner temporarily joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> because only he could save his sister, it seemed like Gaomon was finally going to have to act with a will of his own for the first time ever to prevent some true horrors from taking place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, Touma was only pretending and Gaomon had long since worked it out.</span>
</li><li> The biggest example in the Digimon franchise is the Royal Knights. They are the elite protectors of the Digital World and absolutely loyal to their leader, no matter who sits on the throne. When that's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, or a misguided computer that's decided that that "free will" stuff was a bad idea, that means they'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> as readily as they once fought to protect the same world.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> only) character of Sasuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, who serves the Kunou's every whim, no matter how deranged or unpleasant.
</li><li> Done several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>. One such instance occurred with the Leo Saint realizing that his master was not acting in the interest of Athena but actually against her and deciding to confront him before being brainwashed back into his service. The Sagittarius Saint went rogue and broke into the Sanctuary to saving baby Athena from being killed by the Pope, the ruler of the Sanctuary.
<ul><li> It also happens the other way around in the Asgard arc, in which, no matter if their princess is right or wrong, her warriors decide to fight for her until their death, even if they do acknowledge that she has changed. Yet in another variation, near the end of this arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Siegfried disobeyed his princess' orders when he realized that the ones he was fighting against were not the real enemies and were, in fact, trying to free his princess from the mind control ring she was subjected to. He actually gave them the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> required to free her and sacrificed himself by turning on the emissary of his true enemy.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> episode <em>Island of the Giant Pokémon</em>, Jessie's Ekans and James's Koffing explain to Meowth that they're not necessarily bad Pokémon, and go so far as to assert that no Pokémon is truly bad; Ekans and Koffing, for example, just do what Jessie and James tell them to do. Granted, trained Pokémon in general seem to follow this trope, since the point of capturing a Pokémon is to gain a faithful companion.

He orders Sceptile to use some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">questionable tactics</a> during the fight, and while Sceptile is clearly shocked by each command, he still follows them.

It never really becomes much of an issue after Eva's one token attempt at forcing her way to freedom, though, as Eva turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> at worst, and she usually allows Chachamaru a degree of freedom.

It doesn't matter how evil Orochimaru is, he gave him a purpose.
</li><li> Even further, many unnamed shinobi probably have been forced to do things for their village that they thought were immoral, like slaughter another, smaller village's people in an enemy land. But as a ninja, you are no longer in control of your free will. Like soldiers, you are trained to do what your masters tell you to do, and to do it well. Emotions just get in the way, which is why the ninjas are taught over and over throughout the anime and manga to be emotionless and cold and to not feel anything for their victims (which is something the above-mentioned Haku sorely lacks).
</li><li> There are also Danzo's ROOT, who have at least in theory had their ability to 'care'' whether their master is right or wrong trained out of them. Sai at least regains it, due to the Naruto factor.
</li><li> Uchiha Itachi turned out to be an interesting variation on this. He was one of Danzo's, but (as the heir to a great house and all) he didn't have as heavy an indoctrination as ROOT members, and it wasn't his loyalty to Danzo specifically that was played on, but to his village; he was also laboring under the expectations of his clan and a split sense of duty along with apparently a kind heart, and got used into to ground. In this case, though, he actively chose one loyalty over another when 'both'' were demanding this of him, though since our information is largely third-hand it's unclear whether the deciding factor was that he felt the Uchiha were more wrong than the village or that siding with the Uchiha would just cause more casualties.

</li><li> This is one of the main themes in P.C.

Among the Kencyr people, obedience to one's Lord is considered a foundation of honor; if one's Lord orders one to do something dishonorable, the feeling goes, the dishonor rests on his head, not one's own. However, the whole system is set up with the expectation that such occasions will be few, minor, and moderated by the priests and the judges. Then a situation comes up that wasn't expected; the Highlord of the Kencyrath, the highest authority in the Kencyr people, decides to betray his people to their ancient enemy in return for personal immortality, but he needs the co-operation of others, particularly those close to him in his own House, to pull this betrayal off. Do the rules of honor still apply? When the order is not simply mildly dishonorable but utter betrayal, does honor still compel obedience? Some decide that it does, and, with a heavy heart, commit atrocity. Some decide that it does not, and struggle against him. Others decide that suicide is the only honorable option, while yet others don't know the full extent of what they're asked to do until it's too late. However, honor only requires obedience to the Lord's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>; some decide to obey their orders in as unhelpful a way as they can possibly get away with.

The sergeant's (quite sensible!) response was to tell Vimes to stick it where the sun doesn't shine. (This was the point on Vimes' part as well.)
</li><li> Igors have this as something of a clan policy. They maintain that it's "a pleasure to be commanded in a clear, firm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">voithe</a>" and will follow any directions their master gives to the best of their ability. If the mob actually manages to break the door down, the Igor in question will have fled by his own private back ways long beforehand and will be safe (loyalty to Igorhood comes before loyalty to their master), but they will still follow an order even if it's guaranteed to bring the mob to their doors. The only time an Igor is ever seen to rebel in the Discworld books is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>, when his master has been consistently mistreating him and, interestingly, trying to modernize by not giving these kinds of orders.

</li></ul></li><li> An interesting subversion in <em>Crusade</em>: long in the past, the war leader Cranaa'tolnatha was ordered by the leader of an allied clan - overall commander of a combined force - to obey a battle plan that he knew would result in the forces of all the joined clans except the traitorous warlord's being killed. But he didn't have any actual proof, so he had to choose between obeying his orders and dooming his clan, or disobeying orders and being stripped of all honor and banished from all inhabited lands. He chose to save his people, and was disgraced. But centuries later, Cranaa'tolnatha, the warrior who had the courage to dishonor himself in order to save his people, was remembered as the single greatest hero of the Orion Khanate, while <em>nobody</em> remembered the name of the treacherous warlord he betrayed, not even the clan he once led.

<ul><li> Jaime Lannister is widely despised as an oathbreaker for <em>not</em> following this trope.
</li><li> Ned's sense of duty and honour means he will <em>not</em> refuse a direct order from his King. When Cersei demands the execution of Lady in lieu of the direwolf that bit Joffrey, Ned looks about ready to tell her where she and the other Lannisters can shove it. He only eventually acquiesces when Robert gives him a "get it done" look before storming out. However, as shown by his initial refusal to partake in the conspiracy to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen, his loyalty to Robert <em>does</em> have its limits.
</li><li> Davos tells his son emphatically that he doesn't believe in <em>any</em> God, but if he <em>had</em> to choose one, then as far as he's concerned, Stannis would be it. He plays this off against Maester Cressen as well.
</li><li> Melisandre tries to use this to excuse the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">burning of Shireen Baratheon</span>. Davos explains why this trope is bad.
<div class="indent"><strong>Davos</strong>: If he commands you to burn children, your lord is evil!
</div></li><li> Steelshanks is very loyal to Roose Bolton, and won't take any bribes. Following different orders from Bolton might even entail Steelshanks and Locke dueling each other to death...
</li><li> Maester Wolkan. He's bound to serve the realm, regardless of the actions of House Bolton.
</li><li> Kevan is the first Hand since Ned to have this attitude towards his King (rather than manipulate him).
</li><li> As Kingsguard, Barristan Selmy is sworn to serve the ruling king. In effect, this meant he once served the Targaryens, and following their defeat, accepted a pardon from Robert Baratheon and served him loyally. Despite his misgivings about Joffrey he would have served him loyally had he not been dismissed. Later, he tells Jorah that being freed of his vows by Cersei and Joffrey actually made him want him to serve someone truly deserving. This is also the reason why he did nothing to aid Rickard and Brandon Stark when they were cruelly and unjustly executed by the Mad King, even though he considered it a horrific crime. Ned Stark, being honor-bound himself, understands this and doesn't hold it against Barristan at all.
</li><li> Rakharo is visibly hesitant about the decisions Dany makes, especially when she goes against Dothraki culture, but remains loyal nonetheless.
</li><li> Like Rakharo, Irri seems often less than thrilled with Daenerys' decisions, but still remains faithfully at her side.
</li></ul></li><li> It's implied that Teal'c was like this before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. He did terrible things, and hated himself for them, but he was ordered to by, well, his god. When O'Neill gives him the chance of freedom from Apophis, he jumps at the chance.
<ul><li> Oshu, First Prime to Lord Yu, is a more extreme example. Not only does he know that Yu is not a god, but he knows that he's going senile. Despite this, he remains loyal to Yu until both are killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Replicarter</a>.

Though come to think of it, it rarely occurs to Uther to specifically <em>say</em>, "Arthur, don't release my prisoners from the dungeon."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> episode "Comrades", the team capture a Russian Mobster who, among his many amiable qualities, was an enforcer, a murderer, and a sex-slaver.

<ul><li> To a lesser degree, Lennier has this same thing going on with <em>his</em> boss, Ambassador Delenn, best summed up with one of his introductory lines: "Understanding is not required, only obedience." Lennier is implied to be far less idealistic than Delenn, and also devoted to protecting that same idealism, and ultimately the only thing to threaten his loyalty to her is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ironically enough, his unrequited love for her and jealousy towards John Sheridan.</span>

Both Sisko's team and a Jem'Hadar unit (led by Third Ramata'clan) are stranded on a planet along with an injured Vorta. Unfortunately, the Vorta is nearly running out of Ketracel White, which is necessary to prevent the Jem'Hadar from going berserk and killing everyone they see. The Vorta arranges to be healed by Doctor Bashir and offers his surrender and a comm unit to ensure the Federation's rescue in exchange for the Federation killing off the Jem'Hadar unit. That way he gets to spend the rest of the war in the comfort of a Federation prison (known to treat prisoners fairly, especially compared to the alternatives in other cultures) instead of risking his neck for the Dominion. He plans on sending the Jem'Hadar to attack whether or not Sisko agrees, leaving Sisko with no choice but to agree. Sickened by the thought of ambushing soldiers who are just following orders, Sisko tells the Third about the Vorta's betrayal. It turns out the Third already knew. And, despite having questioned the Vorta's decisions in the past, it doesn't change his commitment to carry out his orders because that is what it means to be Jem'Hadar.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sisko</strong>: Kievan doesn't deserve the unwavering loyalty you're giving him. <br/><strong>Third</strong>: He does not have to earn my loyalty, Captain.

<ul><li> This is the struggle Karai faces in the second and third seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, as the character's loyalty to her adoptive father, the Shredder, clashes with her more noble instincts. One of the forms this clash takes is in her reluctance to kill the turtles, who had agreed to help her restore the New York Foot in exchange for ending the syndicate's vendetta against them. While the agreement was made under false pretenses—it was made under the assumption that the Shredder was dead and that Karai would be leading the Foot, which Karai knew was not the case—she still felt compelled to keep it, despite her father's wishes.
<ul><li> Following the Shredder's exile into space, Karai <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">takes up his mantle</a> and decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvengingTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvengingTheVillain">avenge him</a>, so she ultimately does pick him over the turtles...
<ul><li> ...until he returns in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> movie, now as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>. This proves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">too much for her</a>, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">sides with the turtles against him</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Since Megatron is the undisputed Leader of All Decepticons, Always, anyone wearing the purple has to murmur this phrase if they want to stay sane. The least loyal of Megatron's troops have used excuses for staying under him ranging from "It's still better than the Autobots" to "I get to live how I want", but some 'Cons just say "He's the boss." All except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">one</a>.
</li><li> Cyclonus in Season 3 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">Generation One</a> is a particularly good example of this, to Galvatron.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Machines</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with. The generals Strika and Obsidian are loyal to Cybertron, first, foremost, and always...and, by their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>, whoever is <em>in</em> control of Cybertron, at the time - <em>regardless</em> of who that individual is, or what his plans are - <em>is</em> Cybertron, and will shift their allegiances accordingly. This means, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">as their fellow Vehicon Thrust points out</a>, that they're perfectly willing to sacrifice the sanctity of the planet itself, if that is what its current despot deems necessary (which, yes, <em>does</em> in fact render their "loyalty" to Cybertron moot).
</li><li> Thrust himself: twice during the second season (once at the beginning and again near the end), when it seems as though Megatron has been killed, he refuses to bury the hatchet with the Maximals, deciding, instead, to await Megatron's inevitable return. He stays loyal to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">very end</a>, despite knowing that completing Megatron's plans will involve <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having his own spark ripped out and absorbed</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ravage pulls this off in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, abandoning his mission to kill Megatron after learning that the guy was following the orders of the <em>original</em> Megatron, whom Ravage was still loyal to...even though said plan involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">changing the future by assassinating Prime in the past</a>, the consequences of which he should've been around long enough to figure out on his own (read: involuntary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Lugnut</a> is like this out of blind loyalty. If his <strong>GLORIOUS</strong> master commands it, he will carry it out.

<ul><li> Zuko in the first half of Season 3 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does not say anything when his father orders his generals to <em>commit genocide</em> on the Earth Kingdom by <em>raining fire on everything</em>. To be fair though, you can't really blame him for not wanting to speak out in a war meeting again.</span>
</li><li> It's rather a subversion, because he was probably quietly thinking about the best way to prevent it from the very moment he heard of it. It is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> because Zuko's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a></span> in <em>The Day of the Black Sun</em> looks very inconsistent when you think about how nice his father is to him at this point and how Zuko acted in the season two finale. Then, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, you learn what they said during this meeting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>.
</li><li> Azula as well. By the end of the series, she is so desperate for her father's approval that she'll accept an assignment from him which takes her away from an opportunity for power, glory, and the chance to be at his side. The toll this (as well as the fear that Ozai doesn't think she's good enough and a few other things) has on her psyche is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">not pretty</a>.
</li><li> Season 1 Zuko actually <em>was</em> like this, not so much out of an understanding of honor that stated he had to obey even if his father was evil and wrong, as from conditioning against believing that it was <em>possible</em> for his father to be wrong, no matter how cruel he might be. He was just at the age to start really defining himself ethically, after already thirteen years of propagandistic brainwashing and persuasive evidence that he was considered expendable by his family, when he spoke up against a really coldblooded battle tactic and <em>his father burned half his face off and told him it was his own fault,</em> so he's spent the last three years policing himself for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">thoughtcrime</a>. This is actually more psychologically plausible than this trope pure, not that the trope hasn't turned up plenty in reality.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>, it seemed like Shining Knight was once ordered to destroy a village, but it turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">test of his judgment, and he did the right thing by refusing</a>, thus being an inversion of this trope.
<ul><li> However the General he told this to did not agree, claiming he was a failure for not immediately agreeing to an order from his commander.
</li></ul></li><li> Kif is this to Zapp Branagan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, replete with eye rolls and groans when Zapp does something idiotic. Granted, this is implied to be not out of loyalty or respect for Zapp, but because he has gotten stuck under his recruitment somehow. His self-esteem has withered to such a point that he is still subordinate to Zapp's orders even when both are temporary fired, and he becomes absolutely giddy at the thought of getting another employer.
</li><li> An unintentional and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">and terribly done</a> example occurs in the much-maligned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarePants">Spongebob Square Pants</a></em> episode "One Coarse Meal", where, after having spent the majority of the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">terrifying Plankton to the point of driving him to suicide</a>, it seems like Mr. Krabs is finally going to get his comeuppance; but Spongebob intervenes to save him, letting him get off scot-free, despite how badly Spongebob himself is treated by Mr. Krabs.

<ul><li> This is a defining trait of a Samurai, being basically a Japanese knight that serves unwielding fealty to their lord. In fact, the primary difference between a Samurai and a Ronin is that the Ronin can be described as a Samurai with no lord.
