</p><p>This guy is the ultimate pencil pusher from a government agency or corporation, and he creates the red tape that normal citizens hate. He's an unlikeable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> with a bad temper and a sizable streak of callousness. Works for any and all bureaucracies, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyBankruptBanker">banks</a> and possibly even your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">afterlife</a>. His job, storywise, is to get in the way of whatever the heroes need to do, sometimes because what the heroes are doing is against some form of regulations, but other times because the character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who just doesn't like the heroes and is using "regulations" to make their lives difficult. In disaster movies and other works that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist">lack a real villain</a> (or whose villains are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">too cool to effectively hate</a>), expect this guy to be the work's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes he can be restored to humanity by uncovering the secret dream buried deep beneath his efficient exterior. Failing that, you may be able <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">to use his respect</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">against him</a>.
</p><p>On the other hand, sometimes he is obstructing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath">Matter of Life and Death</a>. Threat of force, or actual force, may be needed to get by him, which could turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">Kick the Son of a Bitch</a> moment. A common cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall">Divided We Fall</a>. Many a surreptitious entry into, or exit from, a location, or requisition of supplies, is needed because it would take too long to get by him. Almost all this form-filling out serves no useful purpose; for the hero to put in a list that will allow him access to a facility, for instance, is a very rare subversion. Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy (see above) is always in effect.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Rarely, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterOfLifeAndDeath">Matter of Life and Death</a>, a benevolent Obstructive Bureaucrat will go and obstruct the villain. He may actively devise regulations to impede and hinder him, and then, with the same mindless fervor as any other bureaucrat, insist on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">being followed to the letter</a>.
</p><p>The tropes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Beleaguered Bureaucrat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">Social Services Does Not Exist</a> overlap since they all involve the same problems. The employees are often overworked, underpaid, lack resources, and suffer the publics wrath. They then turn into the Obstructive Bureaucrat and use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">Bothering by the Book</a> to slow down the workload or get revenge on the people who make unreasonable demands.
</p><p>This trope also has a darker version, where the character is still a government employee concerned with the bottom line, but what he does in daily work probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">violates the Geneva Convention</a>. He is likely to be a murderer and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">a torturer</a> who defends himself by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">"I'm just doing my job"</a>. In short, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> whose overriding motivation is being Employee of the Month.
</p><p>Note that this is not the same as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, another type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">horrible things for some greater good</a>, whereas the Obstructive Bureaucrat has no concept of "greater good", and cares only about following procedure, or rather believes that procedure is equivalent to the "greater good". He's not just <em>prone</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>: as long as the orders match the rules he thinks it's his job to enforce and follow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> is what he is all about. In another sense, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> is the extreme <em>leader</em>, the Obstructive Bureaucrat is the extreme <em>follower</em>.
</p><p>If he has no idea that the job he's doing is evil, he may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDeputy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDeputy">Clueless Deputy</a>. This sort of Obstructive Bureaucrat can be drawn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> more readily than one who does know and just feels it's none of his business (a fella's gotta eat)...
</p><p>For a character who isn't so much obstructive as much as overworked, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Beleaguered Bureaucrat</a>. For a bureaucrat who can actually get things done, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBureaucrat">Badass Bureaucrat</a>. For a civil servant who's outright crooked, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat">Corrupt Bureaucrat</a>.
</p><p>In the US, this character can also be a member of Congress (usually a senator) who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubcommittee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubcommittee">investigating the heroes</a>.
</p><p>This type of character is also known as a "jobsworth" in British slang, named for their tendency to deny a perfectly reasonable request with "That's more than my job's worth."
</p><p>This species might easily proliferate around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBarnum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBarnum">The Barnum</a>.
</p><p>These characters tend towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a>, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>. Usually tends to be a subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain">Villainy-Free Villain</a>.

Rivka gets worse: she is banged up in an insalubrious cell. Apparently that forgotten lump of Klatchian bhong resin in her luggage was a deciding factor.

So what if they need to save Superman? Hal has no travel permit, and that's it.
<div class="indent">Green Lantern was being hassled at the WarPort entrance by the emigration officer. "I'm sorry, sir, but you need official authorization to use the Port to Earth," said the man, a balding, mustached type in a brown outfit. "We just can't authorize passage to non-K worlds without it." <br/>Hal had dealt with planetary bureaucrats before. He held up his ring hand and let the power ring display an aura of green energy. "This is my authorization, officer. I'm a deputized member of the Green Lanterns of the Universe. My authority comes from the Guardians, and I am recognized on every world in my space-sector, which is 2814. And I am a native of Earth." <br/>Kara, behind him, said, "I'll vouch for him, tanth. We both need to get to Earth. It's very important. It involves Superman." <br/>The officer was standing fast, blocking the passageway to the teleportation device a hundred yards distant. Armed guards were on hand, and so was an attendant, and none of them looked like they wanted to be there. <br/>Nonetheless, the officer had just been promoted a few months ago, and he was going to live up to his responsibility. That was the lesson his mother had drummed into him, and by the sun he was going to exercise it. <br/>"It well may involve Tanth El, Tynth Zor-El," said the officer. "But until the gentleman before me produces some government documents, I cannot allow him to port to Earth. You may do so, however, with my blessings." <br/>"This is ridiculous," said Kara. "What's your name, officer? I want to mention it to the Drygur Moliom next time I talk to him." She had two fairly bulky suitcases in her hands and didn't want to set them down yet, even if Hal had negated their weight to make them liftable. One of them held over 100 pounds of clothes. <br/>"You may do so, Tynth Zor-El," he said. "My name is Di-Marr. You may obtain my address from the Central Directory. But unless the Drygur himself authorizes it, I may not allow the gentleman to use the Port. Now, please either both of you leave, or let the Lantern leave and you, tynth, use the Port.

After General Savage takes over the 918th Group, he institutes policies that are seen as excessively harsh, leading to all of the pilots putting in for transfers. Savage needs time to prove that he is right, but is at a loss as to how to proceed. To the rescue comes the Group's Ground Adjutant, Major Stovall, formerly a civilian lawyer. He points out that all those transfer requests will have to be carefully checked, since of course the General doesn't want incomplete paperwork coming out of the Group. Many requests will have to be returned to the squadrons to be redone, then checked again. By the time <em>all</em> of the requests are ready to be submitted to higher headquarters, Savage should have been able to convince the crews that his methods are justified. Savage remarks that it's "a hell of a way to run a war."

For those unaware, a bomber crew member was likely to get injured or killed within 30 missions. He was essentially trying to kill everyone who joined his command.

While it's supposedly their job to create and maintain Britain's Independent Deterrent, that's a long term goal, whereas the Public Relations Committee meet every Tuesday, and therefore the minutes of the last meeting have to be done <em>now</em>. Scientists are frequently disturbed by Security men wishing to check that "valuable equipment" (cheap pocket calculators and ancient slide-rules) are still in the office and haven't been taken home, and the security measures at the front gate seem to be there purely to inconvenience people because that makes things <em>look</em> secure. However, since many of the scientists are rather sceptical about the nuclear deterrent they tend to the view that, while these things are hugely inconvenient for them personally, at least it stops them from actually making weapons, which is probably a good thing. (This situation is, of course, nothing like the real-world Atomic Weapons Establishment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">where Langford worked for five years</a>.)

They are thwarted by Obstructive Bureaucrats in an unusual way: First, they categorically refuse to use the horrifically convoluted official record-keeping procedures, inventing their own, just because they don't want to deal with the paperwork, making the processing once requisitions get to them much faster. Second, because of the long delays caused by the bureaucrats in getting the requisitions to the supply depots, the 'accidental' mistakes often improved things (like sending summer-weight uniforms to a unit that requested winter-weight uniforms and vice versa, not realizing that the units in question had since been redeployed to areas with warmer or colder climates). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">As a result, their sabotage made their depot the most efficient facility in the army.</a>

</li><li> Richard Woolsey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> is exactly this. Even though he strictly believes in rules, he is generally benign and fair, although annoying. When he took command of Atlantis, the initial reaction was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">A Tyrant Has Taken The Helm</a>, exactly because of this trope. However, he turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchTyrant">capable leader</a> after all.
<ul><li> Even once he becomes a good guy Woolsey, uniquely, remains a bureaucrat. In fact he gets a few CMOA out of his skills as a lawyer and underhanded politician.
<ul><li> Senator Kinsey also counts. In his first appearance he tries to get the Stargate Program shut down, under the guise that it's a money pit and exposes the Earth to unnecessary dangers. While he's right, the fact that he's trying to take on a more advanced race with regular weapons and believes God wouldn't let them lose is what cements him as this trope. Later on, he's shown to be working with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> that wants to handle interplanetary relations their way, accusing the SGC of being "too soft". This includes them slaughtering millions of Jaffa, not caring whether the planets they attack are home to Free Jaffa or Jaffa that serve the Goa'uld, thus tacking on "hypocrite" to the above (which he also justifies by citing the Bible).
</li><li> Kinsey's actions, even as part of a conspiracy, are absolutely ungodly stupid. They seem to believe that they could defeat the Goa'uld by stealing certain pieces of alien technology from the Tolan, Tok'ra, and even Asgard and Ancient tech. They never seem to consider that without the help of these guys, especially the Asgard, Earth would have been conquered, glassed and/or shattered by at least a dozen different bad guys.
</li><li> There's also the fact that his initial objection about exposing Earth to alien threats ignores the fact that you can't put the genie back in the bottle. Earth had <em>already</em> been exposed to the Goa'uld, and shutting down the Stargate program wouldn't make them go away or ignore Earth. It would just require them to take (very slightly) longer to attack using spaceships (a point made by Col. O'Neill in the pilot and during the episode in question). Which they do. The very next episode. Understandably, after the shit had barely missed the fan, the rest of the government told Kinsey to put a sock in it and overruled him.
</li><li> Worth noting, Woolsey was introduced as Kinsey's assistant. When he realizes what sort of person Kinsey is and what he's up to, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">he collects evidence on him and turns it over to the President.</a>

Of course, she is also trying to take over the ship, so she's the darker variant. She gets better after things have settled down.
</li><li> The entire IOA counts as this. After watching enough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, you would think the only decisions they make is to put the blame on whoever else they can.
<ul><li> On the rare occasion they <em>do</em> take action, they usually make things worse. Particular mention goes to their borderline-suicidal plan to stop the Ori in <em>The Ark of Truth</em>, which involved reviving the Replicators and taking away their only weakness.

Either way, this means it's time to bring in the next and start the cycle again.

<ul><li> On the other hand, you do see their perspective on things—though the writer clearly disagrees, the Civil Service seems to genuinely believe that it knows what's best for the country, and Humphrey himself is hardly a one-dimensional character. He actually gets a fair number of sympathetic moments in. In the end, you see that they're still Obstructive Bureaucrats, but also see that there's a kind of twisted method to their obstructiveness.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, red tape is one of the many perils of life in Alpha Complex: for example, Troubleshooters might be forced to fill out Personal Authorized Handmounted Firearm Requisition Application Forms (in <em>triplicate</em>) to get laser guns so they can defend themselves from a horde of rampaging mutants.
<ul><li> While being shot at by said mutants, no less.
</li><li> Source materials encourage this, even suggesting a GM may send forms <em>other</em> than what players requested and then execute them for treason if they fail to fill them out correctly or protest that they got the wrong ones.
<ul><li> Another favorite: the equipment they need is available at their clearance level for once, but <em>the requisition form for said equipment</em> isn't. Or, for experimental equipment, the instructions aren't.

They are very close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> when working with other modrons but tend to turn into obstructive bureaucrats whenever they interact with other species. Like Vogons, they can easily push it to the lethal extreme, though it's not due to malice, it's due to Modrons being beings of perfect law to the point that they don't understand the concept of individuality or creativity: they have no choice but to follow laws and instructions exactly as they are given.
</li><li> There are two uses for the Bureaucracy skill and its related Charms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. One is to evade these characters. The other is to become one. With the Charms, you can <em>magically aid</em> your obstructions to be nearly insurmountable.
</li><li> The Vilani Imperium in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> composed of these. They were completely incapable of running the war against the Terrans because of this. Interestingly, they were deliberately designed this way to ensure that the Imperium ran on autopilot and had as little disorder as possible. As there hadn't been a real enemy for thousands of years, it made sense in its day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dominion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dominion">Dominion</a></em>. In this early-Renaissance-themed deck-building card game, the Bureaucrat is an Attack card that forces everyone else to move some useless-in-game cards (which are sort of like deeds to lands) to the top of their decks. These cards therefore take up space in one's hand for two turns in a row, and the Bureaucrat player gets a shiny coin for his trouble.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> roleplaying game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>, one of the locations described is the "Scrivener's System" of Prol, an entire <em>solar system</em> filled almost completely with Obstructive Bureaucrats. There is <em>literally a civil war brewing</em> in the Prol system because they're running out of places to store all the paperwork. All sides making their points in multi-volume treatises is not helping.
<ul><li> It's not like the rest of the Imperium of Mankind's Administratum is all that competent either, as entire planets have been lost because of misplaced paper work or <em>rounding errors</em>. The Tau, on the other, hand, avert this with the Water Caste. Their job is to make everything run better, not worse, and they tend to be good at that job.
</li><li> The Imperial Guard gets this constantly. One of their old codexes gave the example of a regiment that was wiped out making a heroic last stand, officially recognized for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, accidentally assigned to lead an attack due to a filing error, and then <em>posthumously sentenced to death for desertion</em> when they failed to show up. In other cases specialized regiments have been mistakenly sent to the wrong warzones. With jungle fighters being sent to ice worlds, and arctic combatants being sent to battle in rain forests.
</li><li> The Inquisition was made specifically because the High Lords of Terra couldn't be bothered to wait for due process to deal with the billions upon billions of criminals in the Imperium, as it takes centuries to fill out request forms for <em>ammunition and food</em>. Consequently they have absolutely no checks or balances and little in the way of a formal hierarchy or structure, but this has created a chaotic internal environment where political struggles and backstabbing (sometimes metaphorical, sometimes literal) between opposing Inquisitors often delay any useful action, making the Inquisition not that much different than the Administratum they were suppose to circumvent.
</li><li> There is at least one order of the inquisition devoted entirely to cutting through as much as of the Administratum's red tape as possible. Whether they're having any success or making a real impact is unknown and doubtful though.
</li><li> Imperial justice is usually extremely fast, but anything that can't be resolved by crushing somebody's head with a shock maul on the spot can take centuries or millennia to get resolved, with punishment doled out on the criminal's distant descendants.
</li><li> There are apparently entire departments dedicated to redacting information that other entire departments spend all their time collecting. Everyone involved is fully aware of this and do their jobs to the best of their abilities anyway.
</li><li> The audiodrama <em>The Watcher in the Rain</em> focuses on an Inquisition agent sent after an administratum file clerk who got a thousand soldiers killed with a single misfiled document folder. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out she'd done this thousands of times, intentionally, purely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> after her mind snapped from the sheer tedium.</span>

They must pay back their debts to their lenders (a process one card implies takes roughly 500 years), and are mostly used a pencil-pushers to deal with the poor and undesirables the bank has no interest in lending money to, drowning them under mountains of paperwork. Mechanically, their function is to tie up the opponent's resources (for example, depleting their Character cards to no effect). One card's flavor text sums up the experience rather aptly: "Could I please speak to a <em>living</em> person?"

Then we are introduced to his personal resurrection machine (that creates a clone of him and transfers his consciousness to it whenever he dies) and he gradually starts morphing into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> who is just trying to do his job surrounded by people who openly insult him for no reason other than the fact that he's the only guy willing to apply regulations on what is ostensibly a <em>military vessel</em> and often getting killed in the process. The pinnacle of this was a recent storyline where he used his machine to "single handedly" (in other words, going through <em>a lot</em> of dead clones) to take back the <em>Paradigm</em> from hijackers and saving the lives of the rest of the crew...only for Vanderbeam to berate him for taking too long and giving all the credit to his dead clones. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Poor guy.</a>
<ul><li> He ultimately turns out to be a good guy when he is confronted with just how corrupt the government really is. Even then, he is slightly conflicted about breaking laws. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife</span> points out that the government's leadership is betraying the founding principles of the government, so Quine's "insubordination" is actually nothing of the sort.

<div class="indent"><strong>Hermes</strong>: <em>[singing]</em> And they said, "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat / Born to be all obsessive and snotty" / I made my friends and relations file long applications / To get into my tenth birthday party.
</div></li><li> Nicely summed up by the leader of the Central Bureaucracy in this line:
<div class="indent"><strong>Number 1.0</strong>: Hermes, you are <em>technically</em> correct. The <strong>best kind</strong> of correct!
</div></li></ul></li><li> Vice-Principal Bone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> was one of these characters. He had a seemingly never-ending list of rules for student behavior that made it almost impossible to do anything that wasn't against the rules somehow. In one episode, Doug daydreams of himself as his superhero alter-ego Quailman, who battles "The Rulemeister", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> that looks and sounds exactly like Mr. Bone, and who is eventually defeated by being trapped in his own rules. Mr. Bone catches him and grabs his comic away, causing Doug to point out that "No grabbing other people's comic books" is one of his rules, and manages to convince Mr. Bone to let him and the other kids out of detention. In another episode, Quailman battles the "Robo-Bones", robot versions of Mr. Bone. Rather than trapping Bone with his own rules as in the previous example, Doug uses the "Secret Dream" version of escape by convincing the Robo-Bones to become a professional yodeling troupe.
</li><li> An example of this being used for good in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthWormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthWormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em>, where one of these foils 'The thing that dares not speak its name's plan to destroy the universe by making it fill out paperwork first. Paperwork so long that it would take a billion years to fill out. And after that, it turns out it was given the wrong paperwork!
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> film <em>The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</em>, the eighth task is to find Permit A-38 in "The House That Drives You Mad", a Roman bureaucratic office so convoluted it does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. After getting the runaround for a bit, Asterix turns the tables on the bureaucrats by tricking them into looking for the non-existent Permit A-<em>39</em>; after the place is in total disarray, they give Asterix Permit A-38 just to get rid of him-and then goes insane when he realizes someone actually got a permit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a> sometimes works with an Interpol-like spy organization called SHUSH. One SHUSH bureaucrat, a Russian bear named Vladimir Goodenov Grizzlikov, loathes Darkwing and his unpredictable methods; Grizzlikov treats his agency's manual as if it were his Bible. (By contrast, Darkwing's immediate supervisor is too impressed by Darkwing's excellent track record to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">object to his unorthodox techniques</a>.) Subverted in "The Darkwing Squad", in which SHUSH retrains a team of agents to fight crime in Darkwing's anarchic style ... and the squad eventually triumphs by following the book.

She's really under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Long Feng's</a> order to prevent them from doing anything. Also, there was a bureaucrat literally obstructing the Gaang and others at the ferry in Full Moon Bay. The Earth Kingdom in general and Ba Sing Se in particular is depicted as symptomatically bureaucratic, much like the ancient China that pretty much codified the concept of bureaucracy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

They're so into bureaucracy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">it's often their downfall</a>.

An example of how strict he is: Gus and Mikey were standing in line with their permission slips for an excursion, but when they finally got to the front of the line, Menlo pointed out it was a few seconds past the due time, and got angry when they suggested still taking the slips. He seemed to find the fact that there was a line irrelevant. In one episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">he teams up with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant">Randall</a>, and together they basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">take over the entire playground</a> through blackmail, because there's always <em>some</em> rule Menlo knows everyone or one of their friends is actually breaking it.The gang in general reacts quite negatively toward his legalism, although in one episode they are shocked to discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Menlo and T.J. used to be inseparable best friends, but grew apart, some time before the gang got started - and both still have fond feelings for each other, despite the rivalry.

Played for laughs as strict bureaucrat who cannot be threatened (but can be bribed). Also subverted in the sense that his placement is probably for the best, since the ISIS staff have a penchant of taking weapons for personal use, or for sale on the black market.

They once try to arrest Jenny for her vigilantism, but are unable to do so because the necessary paperwork would take <em>decades</em> to fill out. It's little wonder Nora Wakeman retired from Skyway Patrol and began working on creating her daughter. Even Brad realized that being a Skyway Patrol Officer in "Last Action Zero" wasn't all that cracked up to be, especially when basic duties, such as making arrests are completely mummified in red tape and paperwork in triplicate.

It seems that one of Jesus's main purposes in coming back, aside from His sacrifice, was to clarify some very literal and twisted interpretations of Old Testament commandments. The Pharisees tried several times to catch Him in a logical contradiction using Hebraic code.

And proof of ID from the man who signed it. He insists that it is regulations — though regulations that had not been enforced before due to watchmen being scared. This stops them for a while, as no member of the Unmentionables wants to have his name connected to what they do to people. And asking for proof of ID made sense since the Unmentionable who initially signed for the prisoners did so with the name "Henry the Hamster" and Vimes, quite reasonably, pointed out that he'd look a bit silly if he went back to his captain with that on a receipt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, Mayonnaise Quirke of the Day Watch has completely screwed things up, leading to a riot. When a Day Watch officer arrives at the Watch House for help, Carrot first points out they've been relieved of duty, and then asks him a series of questions. Based on the answers he announces that, according to the Laws and Ordinances of Ankh-Morpork, the "Citizen's Militia" is now in control of <em>everything</em>. The Citizen's Militia consists of the Night Watch and whoever else they felt like recruiting.

How is this a good use of resources?" and, somewhat more justifiably "What is the point of Corporal Nobbs?" Vimes tries to wind him up by saying that if he wants to know how the Watch operates he should experience it, and putting him in the middle of a riot, and is rather taken aback when Pessimal enthusiastically gets involved and chooses to remain in the Watch. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em> he's become the Watch's forensic accountant, as long as every so often he gets to wear a helmet and walk a beat.

</li><li> Cornelius Fudge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> proves to be this. He primarily acts as headpiece for the Ministry with recommendations from Malfoy and other respected individuals deciding his actions rather than his own opinions. However, unlike his Undersecretary who is decidedly evil, Fudge simply wants to stay in control, and he seems to know that any disturbance in the peace would see him quickly ousted. As such, he refused to review the case of Sirius Black or accept Voldemort's return in order to maintain the status quo.

In <em>Lieutenant Hornblower</em>, they rescind his uncomfirmed promotion due to the Peace of Amiens and then put him under <em>complete</em> pay stoppage until he's "repaid" the commander's salary he drew during that time—while he's furloughed in London in the middle of winter. He has to pawn most of his possessions and become a professional whist player to survive. In <em>Hotspur</em>, the supplies office gets on his case for using what they deem is too much shot, powder, and cordage while at serious blockade work for months, but Cornwallis fortunately has his back there.

He asks for help investigating this from the four Vice Co ordinators of the four regions in that Earth is divided.

When Hakeswill says the ink ran, he loftily declares that obviously it was corrected.

The team spends its time working on an anti-tank weapon that is theoretically efficient but has little practical field value. The protagonist is a decent yet weak man who fails to take the tough steps needed to improve matters, while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> friend delights in deposing those whom he's deemed incompetent, but ends up putting an even more incompetent man in charge of the team.

In contrast to most of the normal folk encountered on Gemworld (who tend to be pleasant and welcoming enough), the Jeptah - and Bertoran in particular - resent the presence of anyone trying to actually help rather than blindly follow the rules, and complicate plans to save the planet considerably.

While he has some legitimate concerns (regarding Cortana's Rampancy), he is completely dismissive of a soldier whose entire life was defined by protecting humanity (going so far as to flippantly respond to the Chief asking for intel about a combat zone he was being sent to), as well as his own officers. His refusal to try and interdict the Didact allows the Forerunner to retrieve the Composer and wipe out all life in the city of New Phoenix with it, before the Master Chief managed to stop him. Del Rio, meanwhile, ended up thrown in the brig for his treatment of the Chief.</span>

When the bevildered Marines explain, that the Forge is needed urgently to make weapons against the Tyranid Fleet that threates the entire sector, Derosa haughtingly retorts that no Tyranid presence was registered on Meridian (implying that the rest of the sector can go frag itself). However, it turns out she wasn't entirely at fault. The lack of intelligence on Tyranids was due to the meddling from the Eldar, and Derosa was instructed to stall the Marines by the treacherous planetary governor. Once both those issues are resolved, she becomes much more helpful.

First off, the Captain Picard expy and his civilization get massive penalties to spatial travel and are sentenced to planetary rebuilding because they didn't save a planet with intelligent, non-advanced life over First Law regulations. Then 'Yoda' is charged with abducting children to be indoctrinated into a cult and assassinating a legally-elected ruler over 'religious differences'. Finally, what seems like an open-and-shut case of a space pilot making a fatal decision to a young housewife because he wasn't prepared or determined to come up with a third option (spacecraft was carrying crucial medical supplies and there was too much weight, classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdEquation">Cold Equation</a>) ends up going the opposite way because of the bureaucracy forcing him to do it: The shuttle was a deathtrap because of "safety regulations" banning advanced technology or even redundant systems, the housewife stowed away because the local TSA was "cracking down" on space pirates, which made getting a shuttle too expensive, and she was able to get stow away because TSA TERRORIST REGULATIONS BANNED DOOR LOCKS (YES REALLY), and finally, while the pilot wasn't smart enough to just use the chair instead of the housewife, he did call for help and got a direct order to follow protocol and execute her. Fortunately, he got a slap on the wrist<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because he didn't even try to kill her, he intended to kill himself first</span>, and she got paid enough for medical bills (she survived spacing herself) and her own ship. And the TSA was cracked down for designing this no-win situation intentionally to justify their "losing spacecraft constantly"; the plan was to decrease security, wait for hitchhikers to board one of the deathtraps, and then get their recently-promoted pilots to panic and do something stupid, thereby justifying the rumors of pirates (frame the pilot as a murderer, record the death of the housewife, or watch the ship blow itself to bits).

</li><li> Giving every combat aircraft that wasn't a seaplane to the Royal Italian Air Force and putting in place a needlessly slow and complicated procedure for the Army and the Navy to call airstrikes on the enemy, fostering resentment against the Air Force (especially from the Navy, who wanted and needed their carriers).
</li><li> After the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto">Battle of Taranto<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> proved that carriers were necessary, they blocked the construction and development of carrier-based aircraft again on the basis of technical issues that should have already been solved and the carriers' vulnerability in the confined waters of the Mediterranean Sea. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">While they had a point about the vulnerability of carriers</a>, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ended with the crippling of a battleship and the loss of three cruisers and two destroyers <em>precisely because there were no carrier-based aircraft to provide air cover and prevent the torpedoing of the battleship</em>.

Through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">sheer determination</a></em> and blatant disregard for the traditional means of operation of the Japanese bureaucracy, he gets the park built before he dies. At his funeral, his fellow Obstructive Bureaucrats get drunk and promise to take up his example and no longer ignore the cause of their citizens... and the final scene is of everyone doing just that. Well, almost everyone...

Making an entire world act like a bad fantasy novel might seem like a funny concept, until you take into account the people who are tortured, raped or killed because of it. A more benevolent version of this trope is found in another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> book: Brother Lawrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASuddenWildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASuddenWildMagic">A Sudden Wild Magic</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> universe features the Auditors, mysterious, cosmic beings who balance the books of reality. They would prefer an existence devoid of life, which makes things untidy, and intelligent thought, which is even less tidy and predictable. They have repeatedly attempted to eliminate the Discworld in an attempt to tidy up their books.
<ul><li> If they even <em>think</em> the world "I" or "me" or any other personal pronoun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofThree">too many times</a> they Vanish In A Puff of Smoke. They don't have names or even designations. They don't have faces. They never have any original thoughts. They have no feelings. Period. Abstract concepts cause them difficulties as the Auditors want to quantify everything that exists, but cannot isolate these concepts; at one point, they even disassembled a portrait to its component atoms in a vain attempt to locate the beauty.
<ul><li> In <em>Thief of Time</em> they were introduced to mortal delights. Unlike the description in the page header where this could free them of their evil, this doesn't. The shock of experiencing chocolate was enough to make them vanish. Their attempts to catalog everything their body experienced made them think so hard they forgot to exist.

</li><li> One might point out cynically that by defeating the Auditors, Death is protecting his own job, since if there's no life anymore he's literally redundant. In fact the real reason is probably because the Auditors are trying to disrupt the natural order of things, of which Death is a part.
<ul><li> But while he is Bill Door he saves a little girl — even though it's usually his job to take people's lives away. The implication is that while he would prefer to be saving people, he's attached to his job to make sure that no one <em>worse</em> does it.
</li><li> Death has been shown as being the only remaining thing at the end of the universe, and then waiting for another one to inevitably form. His job is safe.
</li><li> By the end of <em>Reaper Man</em>, he makes it clear that he cares, first by asking the Ultimate Death, "What can the harvest hope for if not the care of the Reaper Man?", and, later, having installed fields of corn in his deathly estate, proceeds to carefully notice that they are <em>not</em> all alike, but are individuals each worth caring for. Of course, his waiting for a new universe occurs in an earlier book (he started out as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>) and this was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> book.

He should have a job which isn't vital but affects everyone's day to day life. Something like being in charge of the office supplies.

Kafka manages to incorporate (obstructive bureaucratic) evil into the very fabric of reality. This was actually based on his day-job, where he did everything he could to not be one of these. He largely succeeded, doing more work before 2 PM than most people did all day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxHavelaar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxHavelaar">Max Havelaar</a></em>, the titular character's attempts to do something about the merciless exploitation of the Javanese peasants by their feudal overlords are thwarted at every step by those above, below, and next to him in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. Some actually don't want him to succeed (it's easier to keep the peasants in check if the local feudal system remains in place, after all), but others are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a> who don't want to step on any powerful toes - especially not since Havelaar's similarly idealistic predecessor died in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">terrible accident</a>.

It proves to be more difficult than it appears. Here's why: <em>Deadly Deals</em> reveals her chief of staff, Aaron Lowry, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a>, had been obstructing the presidential pardons, supposedly because it would be political suicide for the president to even try it. She ends up firing him as well as charging him in <em>Game Over</em>, because he turns out to be in bed with Baron Bell, a lawyer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> who had been selling babies! <em>Game Over</em> also has the president obstructed by her advisors, who are more interested in their own agendas than in being loyal to her. At the urging of Henry "Hank" Jellicoe, head of Global Securities, she ends up throwing out many more people, and he supposedly pulls strings to replace them with people 100% loyal to her. She also has the pardons signed, and she paves the way to make it easy for the Vigilantes to sneak in and snatch the pardons! It's hard to be president!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles">Smaller &amp; Smaller Circles</a></em> has Attorney Arcinas, who siphons off resources from the Payatas murder cases and turns down the priests' assistance in order to go chasing after far more sensational crimes.

<ul><li> In his defence, even Arcinas thinks (however mistakenly) that: a) the Director will agree with him that the Bureau can conclude the investigation without the priests' help; and b) the person he framed might actually be the murderer (although the former could just be Arcinas trying to throw the priests off or an attempt to win more glory for himself, and the latter is mostly Jerome's speculation).
</li><li> Subverted by a few other government workers, the NBI Director most of all. The novel pointedly goes on to state that he is something of a rarity in the Philippine government, precisely because he is remarkably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">competent and honest</a>. In fact it is because of this that the Director found it difficult to get good appointments in a public sector crawling with Obstructive Bureaucrats, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat">Corrupt Bureaucrats</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">friends and family of incumbent politicians</a>.

He was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></em> as a Bothan council member of the New Republic, proudly flaunting his species' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">backbiting political savvy</a> (the other hats being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfSpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfSpies">spying</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">hacking</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifeSaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifeSaving">great personal courage</a>). He literally cannot imagine his fellow Council members as <em>not</em> out to get him just as much as he is out to get them; everyone who opposes him is his enemy. He will try and bar them at any given opportunity. And he's on the New Republic's side, shows no signs of going over to the enemy, and does not actually engineer events so much as take advantage of them, so he is never the outright <em>enemy</em>, to several characters' frustration, as that would've given them the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">just shoot him</a>. And unfortunately for everyone, he's <em>very</em> good at recovering from even the most embarrassing political setbacks.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> he does, after Coruscant's fall, surrender to the highest-ranked nearby Vong, and then trigger a massive suicide bomb. Books that don't have him as a petty semi-villain portray him as brave in his way, but unable to let go of his paranoia and vindictiveness.
</li><li> Fey'lya, up to his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyering</a>, tries to take control of Booster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnGunship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnGunship">Star Destroyer</a> and pull off an elegant piece of backstabbing that will end up killing Corran Horn. Fey'lya unfortunately doesn't take two things into consideration; although Booster dislikes Horn, Corran is engaged to his daughter and more importantly Booster, being a 'former' smuggler, doesn't give a damn about any rules or laws protect Borsk. What follows is a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">beatdown</a> of Fey'lya by Terrick that ends with a broken nose and a lot of blood. Whats even funnier is that Fey'lya knows that if he ever does try and get Terrik arrested he'll become a laughingstock among Bothans because he, a fairly young Bothan, got his ass handed to him by a middle-aged human despite the fact Bothans are supposedly much physically stronger than humans.
</li><li> Another example, during the Black Fleet Crisis, rejected Tenn Graneet's application to join the Republic military because he came from an Imperial planet.

They are constantly telling protagonist Holt that they will find him a berth on a ship and allow him to leave the planet "next week" (they seem to take sadistic pleasure in denying him). Finally he meets one who tells him he can get a berth on the ship he arrived at Grayrest on immediately...provided he can get a signature from his missing and presumed dead captain. This infuriates Holt so much that he strangles the dan'lai to death in a fit of rage and has to go into hiding in the titular Stone City...

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> novel <em>The Caves of Ice</em>, there are <em>two</em> particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a>, the local heads of the Administratum and Adeptus Mechanicus. Their constant arguing over protocols and procedure affects not only the normal operation of the promethium-mining facility there, but also the efforts of the Valhallan 597th as it works to prepare defenses against an oncoming Ork onslaught. Fortunately, Cain is able to find some lower-level officials in both ranks who not only are on amicable working terms with one another (and the mining population), but also happen to be able to actually get things <em>done</em> despite their superiors' constant bickering. The "dark" element of this trope comes into play when it is learned that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mine is built atop a Necron tomb; as later evidence proves, the site was intentionally chosen by the AdMech to give them easy access to the facility away from prying eyes should a way be found to investigate the tomb and recover its ancient technology.</span> Fortunately, Cain and his comrades are able to deal with the "obstructive" part of the problem by imposing martial law and threatening to shoot anyone who gets in their way. The Valhallan 597th also owns some thanks to the Administratum, which still thinks they're two regiments, as such they are given twice as much supplies and recruits than most (also why the men/women ratio is always 50/50)
</li><li> Subverted by the Administratum bureaucrat Scrivener Quintus from <em>Death or Glory</em>, who single-handedly organizes logistics for Cain's ragtag army with impeccable skill for several months. He's also quite easy to get along with and even has something of a sense of humour.
</li><li> Also subverted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bursar Brasker</span> in <em>Cain's Last Stand</em> who is using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> to conform to peoples' expectations of a fussy bureaucrat and is actually quite an amiable (and helpful) fellow once Cain finds out. Though, it wasn't so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> as it was Cain never seeing his skills as necessary before, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brasker</span> never really having anything important to do before. The book is written from Cain's perspective, who would have had little interest in how competent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brasker</span> was at his job until the planet was being invaded and he had to ask for his help.
</li><li> There's also a subversion in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a> novel <em>Necropolis</em>. When the government begins bickering over whether they should call the Imperial Guard to help, the ranking Administratum official goes over their heads and contacts the Imperium anyways. He justifies this by saying that the planet is crucial for its production of military equipment, so it is therefore the Imperium's problem, not a local one.
</li><li> It should be also noted that the Administratum, is only Obstructive Bureaucrat because it covers such a large Empire, this is why fluff always shows that the lower-levels are so good at their jobs.
</li><li> The 5th ed. Imperial Guard codex has a mention of a unit that died to a man in battle. The paperwork wasn't completed properly, and their leader was selected to lead a later attack. When they didn't show up, the entire unit was posthumously sentenced to death for desertion.
</li><li> There's an example in one of the <em>Eisenhorn</em> books when Aemos tells someone that if all the data generated by the entire Imperium in a single <em>second</em> was put through all of Earth's cogitators, they would <em>explode</em>.

Another mission has you running all over the city trying to find the bureaucrat with the authority to hand out the new medical supplies; the highlight of that mission is when a guy tells you to talk to his superior, who is <em>five feet away from him</em>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder41');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder41" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A number of German military, German civil service, and Nazi Party officials at the IMT/Nuremberg and other trials post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> attempted to weasel out of the charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity or reduce their sentences by claiming that they had been "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>"— rather than exercising initiative, acting for personal gain, or lashing out in hatred. The Nuremberg Defense has been ruled invalid in situations involving genocide or crimes against humanity, though it can still be a valid legal defense for military personnel: unlike in civilian law, the prosecution has to prove that it was unreasonable for the defendant to be ignorant of the fact that the order was illegal. Opening a gate to let a convoy through: reasonable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/TheHolocaust">Administering lethal injections to four hundred disabled children</a>: unreasonable. It should be noted that genuine fear for not following an order ("shoot them or we shoot you") can be used as a successful defence. Despite some claims to the contrary, this was never a factor at Nuremberg or any of the other post-war trials of German personnel— who were all volunteers. German citizens could not be coerced into committing war crimes or crimes against humanity, and so were worse than useless to the military and civilian security units tasked with carrying out such tasks: their units encouraged them to apply for transfers to regular military units (which undertook such tasks less frequently) so that more enthusiastic people could take their place. Of course, the Germans did force many non-Germans to kill for them as 'Hiwi' auxiliaries— but these were tried separately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoscowCentre">by the NKVD</a>.
</li><li> Early on in his career, Hitler would get around both the law and this trope by making intentionally vague orders to be interpreted in the harshest way possible, mostly as a way of downplaying his involvement in some of the Nazi-associated paramilitary groups' more violent doings. You can bet that if he wanted some Social Democrat or Communist "taken care of", he meant that he wanted that person to be shanked, or worse.
</li><li> The biggest thing keeping the Nazis from coming <em>anywhere near</em> to getting an A-bomb was, right after encouraging their Jewish physicists (i.e. <em>most of their physicists</em>) to emigrate, infighting. Of the five nuclear programmes, the most advanced was headed by <em>the Post Office</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> once claimed, "There seems to be an increasing awareness of something we Americans have known for some time: that the ten most dangerous words in the English language are, 'Hi, I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'"
</li><li> Averted during the Russian Civil War. "Bureaucracy" was a serious accusation against any official, as it was deemed that paperwork should not get in the way of revolution. In more egregious cases the bureaucrat could even be court-martialed.
</li><li> Before he became the Soviet dictator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> was General Secretary of the Communist Party, which gave him powers of patronage, the resources he needed to build up a power base in the party, and control of the civil service and Politburo. Effectively, he was Russia's chief bureaucrat, and he was good at it, by all accounts. Other members of the party gave him names like "Comrade Card Index" and "the Grey Blur", but he certainly showed that a list of names and a telephone are as useful as a gun when it comes to taking over a country. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a> had relied on the bureaucracy (as well as the church and army) as a major part of controlling the country. This directly led to General Secretary of the Communist Party becoming the <em>de facto</em> highest office in the USSR; Stalin managed to turn a bureaucratic office into the imperial seat. It wasn't until Mikhail Gorbachev that the USSR underwent a political shakeup in the early '90s and the Executive President became the Soviet Union's highest office (the Union didn't last very long after that).
</li><li> There is a reason why almost all procedural laws relating to the filling out and filing of court documents say "A document is not invalid simply because it doesn't follow a form." Of course, some don't help by immediately specifying the forms to horrifying detail (margins, spacing, font, etc.)
</li><li> Indian Agents in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> were notorious for this. They would steal the subsidies meant to keep the reservations from being more miserable than was perceived as necessary. Then they would sell guns to the Indians. They thus provided both the provocation and the means at the same time. Of course the ones who suffered from this were Indians and soldiers, and not Obstructive Bureaucrats. This was alluded to in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>'s cavalry trilogy.
</li><li> Erich Honecker, the longest-ruling and most well known leader of East Germany, was quite possibly the most conservative of all East Bloc leaders, and his country was notorious for its all-pervading, soul-crushing bureaucracy. He even <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R0518-182,_Erich_Honecker.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R0518-182,_Erich_Honecker.jpg">looked the part<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> It should be remembered that Government employees are, unlike most other jobs, enacting the law of the country; everything they do can have legal ramifications. Not following a law, no matter how absurd in a specific situation, can set a precedent that allows others, to whom the law should be a reasonable requirement, to complain they are not getting equal treatment. Civil servants are often given a range of options within which they can act, to allow them some judgement, but cannot legally act outside this clearly defined range.
</li><li> Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis became infamous because she was being obstructive for <em>not</em> doing her job. After the US Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite the ruling by claiming it was a violation of her religious rights. She was sued to try and force her to issue licenses to gay couples, from which she repeatedly tried to fight by appealing to higher courts until she reached the Supreme Court. Despite this, she still banned her deputy clerks from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. This led to Davis being jailed for a number of days for violating a court order. Long story short, she will not personally issue same-sex marriage licenses, but she isn't allowed to veto when they're issued.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourierFromWarsaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourierFromWarsaw">Courier From Warsaw</a></em> the author recounts the troubles Churchill's assistant (who may or may not have been a Soviet agent) gave him, from the "yes, sir, of course the prime minister will see you sometime in this century" variety, to outright lying his face off to discredit the author and his entire organisation.
