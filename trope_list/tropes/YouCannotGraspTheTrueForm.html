No physical description is given, however, on the basis that the sight was so terrifying and incomprehensible that it was blocked immediately and entirely from the spectator's memory.

Ollerus (a ridiculously powerful sorcerer) and Gunha Sogiita (Level 5 esper) are a couple... Gunha doesn't even know how his own abilities work (he thought he figured it out at one point, but was told that he was wrong). This is actually a great boon to these characters, as if your opponent doesn't understand what they're being attacked with, they cannot form an effective defense against it.

</li><li> A Majin wields power that very few can understand. When Othinus (a true Majin) and Ollerus (a "failed" Majin) have a brief battle, bystanders can tell that <em>something</em> happened between them, but they cannot explain what.

More unusually for the trope however, the series suggests that logically the inverse must also be true — just as a human cannot ever truly understand a Lovecraftian outer god, such a god cannot ever truly understand what it is to be human.

The closest approximation for its physical form that the protagonists could comprehend was a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">Giant Spider</a></span>; anyone who sees Its true form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">the deadlights</a> will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">driven insane</a> at the very least.
</li><li> This also happened with the eponymous character of Stephen King's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseMadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseMadder">Rose Madder</a>,</em> whose true form was something like a spider... thing. Rosie was warned several times not to look at it.
</li><li> Happens AGAIN in the Lovecraft-inspired <em>Crouch End</em>, where the woman telling the story to the police recounts how her husband saw <em>something</em> in a pit in Crouch End, she was only able to glance it but he saw the whole thing, and his mind immediately blanked it out and caused him to regress mentally.
</li><li> This is the whole plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromABuick8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromABuick8">From a Buick 8</a></em>, with the Buick not really being a car, or even anything remotely resembling one; it simply looks like one to our senses. It might be described as a gate to another dimension, but it probably isn't that either, not fully or exactly. One of the main characters actually compares it to the breathing apparatus on a scuba tank.
</li></ul></li><li> Mostly averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s works as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> tend to appear in their true form, which tends to lead to madness in those who see them. Sometimes it's played straight, though:
<ul><li> Yog-Sothoth is perceived by mortals as congeries of iridescent spheres because his true body transcends the space-time continuum and we only see the small parts of it that happen to intersect with that particular location in time and space.
</li><li> Nyarlathotep tends to appear in a form of a man because it makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">manipulating humans</a> easier. He has several less human forms too (1000 to be exact) but all of these are just avatars, or "masks". What his true form looks like is never even hinted, but as he is the soul of the Outer Gods, he might not even have a physical body outside the avatars.
</li><li> Although it's never explicitly mentioned, considering the insignificance of mankind in Lovecraft's cosmology it's very unlikely that the Elder Gods naturally look humanoid. More likely the human-like forms they appear in are used by them in order to not drive humans insane. The Elder Gods oppose the Great Old Ones, and since mankind would be destroyed if the Old Ones awaken, they are the closest thing the Derleth-subscribed mythos has for benevolent deities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Not that that's saying much</a>.
</li><li> In "Through the Gates of the Silver Key", Yog-Sothoth explicates a major implicit premise behind the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>: practically everything we experience goes under this trope, including three-dimensional space, change and time, and the individuality of what we ordinarily think of as different creatures. Ramsey Campbell's "The Render Of Veils" exploits this variation of the trope to <em>very</em> disturbing effect.
</li><li> The titular "Colour" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOutOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOutOfSpace">The Colour Out of Space</a></em>.

In that episode, the crew joins the Q Continuum rebels against the Q old guard. Because the humans (and aliens) cannot comprehend Q weapons, they perceive the situation as the American Civil War... even the weapons they're using against the old guard Q. (Tuvok threatens these Q with their own weapons after being insulted.)
</li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IQ">I, Q</a></em> goes so far as to say that the human mind does this automatically to stay sane and that Data normally shuts down because his android mind tries to "see" everything and crashes. Q must filter the sensor input so Data can function.
</li><li> In fact, the Q Continuum has never been truly perceived by visitors; they're always shown a representation which they could understand.

After Commander Sisko goes into the Bajoran wormhole, he meets the Bajoran Prophets: other dimensional beings who are the gods of Bajoran mythology. They assume the forms of Sisko's son and deceased wife, but not so Sisko can comprehend <em>them</em>: they have no concept of beings who exist in linear time, so most of their interaction is <em>them</em> trying to figure out <em>him!</em>

<ul><li> Angels cannot be comprehended except by their true vessel. Anyone else who glimpses their true form has their eyes melted out of their head, and anyone else (or any<em>thing</em> around anyone else) that is around their true voice experiences what basically amounts to tornado conditions. To even be comprehended, they must first take a vessel. Any improper vessel, even the next closest thing, will eventually explode under the power.
</li><li> Archangels are even worse. The very presence of their true form is capable of doing all of the above, but with massive earthquakes, and instant death for anyone who's around. This can even remain true when they're in a vessel. Raphael simply manifesting himself created a thunderstorm that knocked out all power to the Eastern Seaboard. In a later episode, he similarly created another thunderstorm when he manifested again. When he showed up to protect a prophet, the growing light was tearing the room apart.
</li><li> According to Zachariah, in response to Dean mocking him for still looking like a bald, middle-aged man when they run into him in Heaven, his true form has 6 wings and 4 faces, one of which is a lion.

Islam takes this bit particularly seriously; arguing that if God's true form is alien and utterly incomprehensible to humans, then you cannot picture Him as anthropomorphic, therefore doing so and worshipping God through pictures is considered blasphemous, heretical idolatry (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm">Christianity under the Byzantine Empire also tried this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but failed). Which then rubbed off on Moses a bit, since when he came back to everybody else his face blinded them into making him wear a veil. That said, several Old Testament figures (including Abraham, and for that matter Moses) are said to interact with God directly. The usual explanation is that they were speaking with an angel who was speaking directly for God (acting as a kind of cosmic telephone), or else that God was appearing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">a form they could comprehend</a>. Christians often interpret these events as pre-incarnate appearances of Christ, the "image of the invisible God".
</li><li> In another incident (Exodus chapter 24 for those who care) God appeared in full glory for seventy-four leaders of Israel total. The fun part? It mentions that they all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidWeJustHaveTeaWithCthulhu">ate and drank together</a>, it says that God stood on a sapphire pavement, and absolutely nothing else.
</li><li> Notably, this is subverted in the Catholic faith, as the saints will get to see God in all his glory in Heaven, often referred to as Beatific Vision. The idea behind it is that it should destroy your very soul, but God, being God, could perserve someone from letting that happen. (Or perhaps that "no man sees my face and lives" isn't so much of a concern if you've already died...)
</li><li> Also applies to the Seraphs, God's personal throne guards. They keep themselves hidden with their wings (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">they have six or more, by the way</a>), as any mortal who looks at them directly bursts into flames or get annihilated instantly.
</li><li> Regarding Heaven, some believers reject a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">Fluffy Cloud Heaven</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a> interpretation of the afterlife, instead preferring a metaphor-based no-true-form spin on where we cannot really comprehend the true form of those dimensions, and the literal interpretations above are just approximate interpretations of what is really happening in there. For example, Heaven is a state that is expressed in metaphor as a place of peace and bliss, while Hell is filled with so much of all kinds of sin, chaos, insanity and perversions against nature that the human (and supernatural) mind is unable to cope with it, and tries to resolve it into a Hell it can comprehend and express in art, namely a dark inferno filled with pain and disgusting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>.
</li><li> Averted with Jesus generally, although revealing Himself to Paul later on (after the Ascension), is likened to a lightning strike and knocks Paul off his horse, temporarily blinding him. Some forms of Gnosticism instead teach that Jesus never was physically incarnated, and had no tangible form.
</li><li> The New Testament condenses all of its incomprehensibility in the book of Revelation. Okay, so the four horsemen and great seven-headed beast are all <em>probably</em> metaphorical... and <em>maybe</em> angels in their native environment really are humanoids, some with six wings and using four of them to cover their faces and feet, or have four wings and four faces... but then John talks about things like how "the sky rolled up like a scroll," and you start to get an inkling of how <em>everything</em> this poor man's mind was experiencing utterly defied all human comprehension.
</li><li> Plus, John had to describe things as he understood them, using similes of things he knew. At one point, he describes "locusts with breastplate of armour" whose "wings beat with the sound of a thousand chariots going into battle," which some scholars have theorized could have been a first century man's impression of a modern combat helicopter.
</li><li> In The Acts of the Apostles, the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles "like tongues of fire". Since the only way to make light in the first century would have been A) the Sun (obviously not it) B) lightning (again, not in a flash) or C) fire, this would have been the only way someone then could have described it. They would not have said something like "descended with the brightness of a 100-watt light bulb."

</li><li> Played straight in Judaic and Talmudic literature, which says that God is incomprehensible. Oddly enough, some Kabbalistic poems describe him as though he were a human king, though the rabbis dismiss this as an elaborate metaphor.

<ul><li> This is exactly what happened to Dionysus' mother Semele, one of Zeus' lovers; Hera tricked her into doubting that he was truly who he claimed to be, and she insisted that he reveal his true form. Due to an oath he made to fulfill a promise to her, he had to comply. He managed to save her unborn child however, placing him under the skin of his thigh until he could be born.
</li><li> By definition, Medusa. Though her description is well-known — a hideous, snake-haired woman at her most basic — you literally cannot look at her or you'll turn to stone and (implicitly) die.

</li><li> In the theological theory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism">Pandeism</a>, it is proposed that those who are somehow able to contact the mind of our Creator as it unconsciously underlies our Universe find that experience so incomprehensible that their tiny human minds automatically defend themselves by interpreting such encounters as conscious communications from culturally familiar conceptions of gods, thereby explaining <em>all</em> revelation and scripture.

<ul><li> The Obyriths, <em>the</em> primordial race of demons spawned by the Abyss eons before life arose on the Material Plane. Their bizarre, horrifyingly-alien appearances grant the Obyriths an ability called "Form of Madness." Their presence is established to be an affront to all five senses, which causes anyone who so much as <em>senses</em> them to be afflicted by an oftentimes permanent type of insanity (phobias, feelings of being consumed by insects, etc).
</li><li> Pale Night, the so-called Mother of Demons, is ancient even among the surviving Obyriths, but lacks the "Form of Madness" rule. She appears as a feminine figure wrapped in a white shroud blowing on a spectral breeze, which occasionally shifts to <em>almost</em> reveal what's underneath. This is neither her true form, nor a conventional illusion — instead the veil (which she can suppress with some effort) is a sort of cosmic censor, because her actual appearance is so horrifying that <em>reality itself refuses to accept it</em>. Pale Night's "Truth Behind the Veil" rule means that anyone who gets a good look at her true form must make an immediate (very high) saving throw; success means that the character's mind refuses to comprehend what they're looking at. Those who fail die outright, and if revived remember nothing of what they saw beyond a feeling of sheer horror.
</li><li> Even some incredibly powerful forces of Good cannot be viewed safely by mortals. The <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> sourcebook mentions Zaphikiel, the greatest of the Hebdomad and the ruler of Mount Celestia. Only the gods themselves and the other Hebdomad can look upon him safely; anyone else who does so is said to be consumed by his overwhelming radiant energy and destroyed utterly. (Or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended to a higher form</a>; it depends on who you ask.)

The actual underlying processes of magic are beyond human beings' ability to understand, so there need to use metaphor and symbolism to compose their spells. For those few mages who become capable of entering the Supernal itself, it's necessary to expend great effort to force it into a comprehensable symbolic form, or else unfiltered contact with it will utterly obliterate the mage. One of the goals of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascension</a> is to achieve a state in which true perception of the Supernal is possible.

</li></ul></li><li> A fairly common trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">In some depictions</a> the Emperor of Mankind (a living deity) is so powerful that most mortals cannot gaze upon his true form (he occasionally disguises himself, both to hide his identity and to protect onlookers). Those who attempt to either die, are blinded by the power inherent in his visage, or else their minds simply are unable to process what they are seeing. Even those who can safely look at him (generally those who are extremely powerful or have strong wills) see him as somewhat indistinct, with his features constantly changing and shifting. Some of his sons, the Primarchs, inherited this ability.
<ul><li> In some depictions his form and even his words vary with the observer. To his Blank (psychically-immune) bodyguards however he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is just a man.</span>
</li><li> Magnus the Red, Primarch of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandSons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandSons">Thousand Sons</a></em>, got the lions share of his fathers incomprehensible nature, and that was before he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Daemon Prince</a>. Any two people who look upon his physical form will see two <em>very</em> different things, and a single observer who looks at Magnus multiple times will perceive him in a completely different way each time. His solitary eye is the only detail that remains consistent across all his forms, and even then it will have different structures and colours depending on who is looking at it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">The Warp</a> is a dimension that is quite literally made of this trope. It is a realm of madness where emotion is given form and where the laws of physics do not apply. Ships travelling through the Warp have protective shutters drop down over their viewports, because those who gaze into the Warp have a high risk of going mad.
</li><li> Fittingly, given that the Warp is their home (and that they're made of the stuff), daemons are similarly subject to this trope. Daemons appear differently to different people, meaning that two soldiers can fight the same daemon at the same time and give completely different accounts of what it looked like (both of which would be wrong — the human mind is simply unable to process what a warp-denizen <em>actually</em> looks like, so it just substitutes something suitably terrifying in its place).
</li><li> Psykers, particularly human astropaths and navigators, are psychically-gifted individuals whose job it is to try and comprehend the true form of the Warp in order to steer ships through it (navigators) or pass messages through it (astropaths). It is an imperfect science at best — navigators fly as much on instinct and gut feelings as any actual dictates of their training and astropaths have a notoriously difficult job because incoming messages are less "transmission of the actual message" and more "indistinct thoughts and feelings that must be correctly interpreted to mean something vaguely close to what the sender was trying to say". Making the job harder is the fact that the Warp doesn't have linear time, either, so a message from across the galaxy can be 5 minutes old or 5 thousand years, or even come from the future.

</li><li> The Daedric Princes are the spirits who did not participate in the creation of Mundus, and thus remain at full power with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>. They are really a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> who subscribe to their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> depending on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">sphere they represent</a>. When dealing with mortals, however, they often take a form that mortals are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">more comfortable and familiar with</a>. One exception is Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Knowledge (with a specialty in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">Eldritch knowledge</a>). When he takes form, it tends to be as an infinite and mind-melting mass of tentacles and eyes. Within his realm of Apocrypha, his tentacles <em>blot out the sky</em>.
</li><li> The eponymous Elder Scrolls, also called "Fragments of Creation", in addition to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Tomes of Eldritch Lore</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomesOfProphecyAndFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomesOfProphecyAndFate">Tomes of Prophecy and Fate</a>, can be this depending on the reader. If the reader is completely untrained in reading the scrolls, the scrolls appear to be a sort of star chart with indecipherable glowing glyphs printed over (and under) the map. If the reader has some knowledge of the scrolls, they may be able to decipher some knowledge, but it will likely be incomplete, and the reader will be struck instantly blind. A fully trained and mentally prepared reader, such a member of the Cult of the Ancestor Moth (who tend to be the primary keepers and readers of the scrolls), can glean significant knowledge and recover their eyesight, but will eventually go blind after repeated readings. In all cases, including for people who merely study the nature of the scrolls and never even use them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">complete madness</a> is a frequent side effect. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Dragonborn</a> can attempt to read an Elder Scroll. The result is a split second view of strange runes and writing before temporary blindness sets in. It is implied that that the only thing preventing you from going blind or insane is that you possess the soul of an immortal being (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine">dragon</a>, in this case) and thus exist slightly outside of time, just like the scroll itself.

</li><li> Featherine Augustus Aurora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> is an interesting take on this.

Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">witch of untold age</a>, she had to create a horseshoe-shaped device that hovers around her head. This thing not only contains all of her memories, but even her physical appearance. According to Lambdadelta, it once got dinged in the past, abruptly changing Featherine's personality and form.

She doesn't even write <em>what</em> killed Lambda, deciding to think it up later.

The closest to a description the narrator manages to provide when it is seen is that whereas its depiction had been scratched out from pictures on the walls before, looking at the real thing is a lot like looking at those pictures, because all you can see is still something blurry and formless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DimensionalProphecyOfZoharRedux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DimensionalProphecyOfZoharRedux">Dimensional Prophecy of Zohar Redux</a></em> The attacking Caine aliens have a form which is incomprehensible and in most parts even invisible. The only things people can see are hands which look skeletal and have lots of tumours growing on them, attacking people, or giant eyes floating in the air. Most people who saw the Caine went insane and/or started to hallucinate. Because of this, during Caine attacks, it is unknown if there is just one Caine attacking, or if there are several attackers at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Lioden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Lioden">Lioden</a></em>: When visiting Hell during the October event, souls in the forms of ghostly lions are visibly being tortured by demons. The narration notes that they probably only look like lions to you because that's the best way you can understand them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm">Orion's Arm</a></em> takes a slightly different approach. An intelligence of a lower toposophic <em>cannot</em> understand a higher intelligence. Humans are considered S0 intelligences (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">the lowest level of sapient intelligence</a>), and cannot comprehend the nature or thoughts of an S1 intelligence (Basic Transapient). However, an S1 is likewise unable to comprehend the thoughts of an S2 entity, and so forth. The highest intelligences (or at least the highest <em>known</em>) are the Greater Archailects (S6), which exist physically as multiple planet-sized objects networked together, sometimes at least partially in alternate universes of their own creation. It's said that an archailect's <em>individual thoughts</em> are themselves sentient entities, whatever that means. Given that an S6 is effectively a vast and all-powerful interstellar civilisation in itself, an S7 (if such beings exist) would be... perhaps literally incomprehensible to humans.
</li><li> The portals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar">The Salvation War</a></em> are very hard for anyone to really comprehend what they are seeing, describing it in completely contradictory terms (for example, one character notes it looks both parallel and perpendicular to the ground). It is mentioned at it at least a seven dimensional object, and what is seen is a best the "shadow" of the real thing.
</li><li> A good many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCPs</a> are likely to qualify, although most are written as mundane things with strange properties, rather than strange things appearing as mundane things. The most prominent of these would probably be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-055">SCP-055<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is a... thing. Anybody who sees it will completely forget about it within a few minutes. Anybody who hears or sees secondhand details, including picture and video, about it will also forget about those within a few minutes. The object is classified as Keter (most dangerous) simply because the Foundation <em>doesn't know</em> if it's dangerous, specifically mentioning that it could have killed hundreds of personnel in the process of getting it and they wouldn't remember any of it. People <em>can</em> remember what it isn't, however, and so far the Foundation has determined that SCP-055 is not spherical. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/revenants">This story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> dials the horror of such a... thing that isn't spherical up to eleven.
<ul><li> Go ahead. Try visualizing what number <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-033">SCP-033<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is supposed to be. The closest the article comes to explaining what it is is by using the example of humanity not ever coming up with 5, instead skipping straight from 4 to 6 simply because the quantity of 5 was never conceived of. To make matters worse, the range of numbers this integer is supposedly located in has been expunged from the record, and the number itself is so chaotic it literally cannot fit into ANY known mathematical system; absolutely all calculations, no matter how large or strange, are done without it or knowledge of it, and trying to make use of it <em>causes logic itself to break down</em>, manifested as objects on which the number has been written <em>degenerating into mush</em>.
</li><li> Then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3930">SCP-3930<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose threat is <em>driven</em> by the fact the human mind keeps trying to grasp it. It's <em>literally</em> nothing, a perfect nothing where nothing exists, nothing leaves, nothing is visible, etc. But the human mind, with its tendency to see patterns where there's none, goes into overdrive and overwrites that nothing with something; the equivalent of seeing shapes in clouds, something where there's nothing, except this time it sees Russian wilderness and a building where there's nothing at all. Anyone that enters that nothing ceases to exist, too, but the brain continues to act as if it does, and anyone watching or listening continues on like the individual actually went there and saw things. But that all breaks down, loses consistency as the brain keeps lying to itself because it can't put up with actual nothingness, right until concentration is broken and the invented individual with their invented expedition stop registering. They were always gone, but that shadow the mind invented is gone too once the thread is broken. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And in those utter voids, even these little shadows have an influence, the edge of this void starts piling up with these invented things that aren't real, but seem real enough to manifest, and they merge together. The more people know of this void and subconsciously overwrite it with their own patterns, the more they are. If there's too much of this thought together, too many of these inventions of the mind piling up at the edge of nothingness, they start to merge into one thing, it becomes complex, gains a sentience, and realizes what it actually is. It exists now, and it would <em>very much like</em> to go back to not existing. That little thing is what's known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Pattern Screamer</a>, because it's born from seeing nonexistant patterns, and it screams in hatred of thought that brought it to be. The only way to erase it is to erase the inventions that made it happen; the only way to make <em>that</em> happen is to send the ones who thought them into this nothingness, so they'll stop existing. The threshold is around ten people; any more than that knowing of this void, and the screaming starts</span>.

The character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant">Nacht</a> gives an apt analogy:
<div class="indent">Imagine that youre in a boat and you see some fish in the water. You reach your hand into the water to grab one of the fish. From the fishs point of view, this weird thing with a flat body and five tentacles and a weird thick tail that reaches out into nowhere, but no eyes, mouth or fins, just appeared in a shower of bubbles. It moves around in ways that have nothing to do with swishing its tail or moving fins in any way. Then this thing which shouldnt be any stronger than the fish is, and has no eyes with which to see, wraps itself around one of the other fish, and suddenly that fish disappears from the first fishs plane of reference. The hand is utterly alien to the fish, and it operates in ways that would seem magical to it, if fish had the brains to encompass the notion of magic. I think that your Headhunter is like that: it has much, but not all of the power of the demon at its disposal, and it has a perspective that most mortals cant have, and it operates on very different principles and motives.

<ul><li> Ever wondered why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsTheNewBlack">Purple Is the New Black</a>? <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/PurpleIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/PurpleIsTheNewBlack">Because there is no black.</a></strong> A true black would reflect no light whatsoever and would look like a hole in space. That only happens in black holes. Since vision works by light reflecting off of objects, and true black is the absorption of light, our human eyes literally <em>cannot</em> see true black. A good demonstration is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack">Vantablack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

It's simply a layer of Vantablack coating a sheet of foil. The reason it looks like a blank, formless blob is because it absorbs all the light needed to see the foil's crinkles and ridges.
</li><li> One of the great challenges for an artist learning advanced color theory is to get comfortable with exploiting the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy">Color Constancy illusion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In any piece with strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodLighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodLighting">Mood Lighting</a>, colors you think you are seeing are usually just slight tints of one or two hues. What looks like a strong green in the image may actually be, say, a pale orange-grey — it only <em>looks</em> green compared to the colors around it.
</li><li> The color magenta does not correspond to a single wavelength of light, and is not part of the light spectrum — there is no such thing as "pure" magenta light. Rather, it is the brain's way of interpreting multiple wavelengths of light from disparate parts of the color spectrum being received by your eye at the same time. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html">In the case of magenta, it is a combination of red and violet light, which are from opposite ends of the color spectrum; in order to "properly" interpret this, rather than seeing it as an intermediate color, the human brain instead perceives it as magenta.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <br/>Yet while pink is often highlighted as an example of such an "unnatural" color, in reality, the majority of colors humans see are this — anything which is not one of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spectrum.svg">colors of the rainbow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the human brain's way of interpreting a mixture of different wavelengths of light. Indeed, white and gray are the most common examples — white light is merely light which contains a mixture of light wavelengths in high enough and close-to-equal concentration, whereas gray is the same thing, only there is less stimulation. Thus, while there is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet light, colors like pink, white, and black are mixtures of light. Creatures with different peaks for their visual spectrum would likely interpret such mixed colors in a different way. A fascinating experiment involving a similar illusory color made from tiny checkerboards of green and red proved impossible to describe properly in normal terms. Trained artists could describe aspects of it like its chroma value and saturation, but the color itself refused categorization within the color wheel.

The brain cannot process or even imagine a color that is outside the range of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to humans. This is why Don Joyce's "Squant" never ceases to madden people with its premise and Crosley's matter-of-fact discussion.
</li><li> Language is also linked to our perception of colors. If a language and culture has a bigger difference between colors, people in that society are better able to distinguish colors. This goes the other way too, as people who lack distinctions for colors are slower to recognize differences between them. However, the idea that they are incapable of doing so is pure myth; the difference is in fractions of a second of recognition speed, not actual differences in visual acuity. There is evidence that colors which humans cannot manufacture do not have names and are therefore not recognized. Scholars have studied ancient texts, including The Iliad and The Odyssey, specifically looking at the usage of color words. Many very strange color identifications are given: Green Honey, Violet Sheep, and Wine-Dark Seas. These were often regarded as "colorful" metaphors until linguist Guy Deutscher realized <strong>there is no blue mentioned in them anywhere</strong>. At the time there were no blue dyes available and there simply wasn't a word for blue, so people had to use other colors to describe what we now know as blue. This is a pattern across all cultures: color usage appears in stages, and blue is always last. This can also be seen in young children; if they don't yet know a color they'll refer to things of that color by a color they do know. An example, again involving blue, children will refer to the sky as white (which most adults will reflexively say is blue) before they know the color blue.
</li><li> Some people have four types of cone cells <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2em4c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2em4c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2em4c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the type of cell which is primarily responsible for our perception of color</span> in their eyes rather than three, which gives them a small advantage in distinguishing colors, particularly in the red region of the spectrum. Because these genes are carried on the X chromosome, this condition is more common in women, but some men also carry both variants of the red-green gene on a single X chromosome. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3btf8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3btf8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3btf8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You aren't missing much if you don't have this condition, for the record. It mostly just makes it really, really frustrating to set the gamma on your monitor using only three colors, and makes people look at you funny when you try to explain the obvious difference between red and dark maroon.</span> People with only two sets of cone cells instead of three (color blindness) or with inadequate numbers of or malfunctioning cone cells (milder forms of color blindness) are less able to distinguish colors, and as a result colors which contain light of the wavelength they are "blind" to appear considerably different to them. Related to this are images taken by telescopes (or other instruments for the case) designed to work with wavelengths that do not correspond with visible light, like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope">Spitzer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (infrared) or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory">Chandra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (X-Rays). The images of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds">Space Clouds</a> that we see that have been taken by them are actually processed false-color images so we can see them with our eyes; if they were sensible to those wavelengths while we'd see something more or less with the same aspect (ie: an infrared-bright region of star formation, an X-Ray emitting galactic nucleus, etc) their "colors" would be quite different.
</li><li> In (amateur) astronomy, an interesting physiological effect takes often place when observing a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_star">double star<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as the less bright of the pair is seen in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors">complementary color<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the brightest one -ie, when observing a double whose brightest component is orange seeing the less luminous as green or blue, even if it's actually yellow or white.
</li><li> Human brains are designed to perceive the world in three dimensions, but the human eye only perceives the world in two dimensions. The brain uses the 2-dimensional input from each eye in addition to some image process recognition to construct the perception of a third dimension inside the brain, which is why people with only one eye have diminished depth perception. This can be thrown off in various well-known ways, such as presenting a different image to each eye — something 3D glasses take advantage of to create a stronger illusion of the third dimension from a 2D image. Many visual illusions take advantage of the brain's visual processing — perspective in paintings is a matter of tricking the eye into seeing 3D distance which is not actually present, while real-world environments can be constructed in order to trick the brain into seeing a 3D space as being larger, smaller, or otherwise strangely shaped. Because the brain is designed to construct 3D images, it makes visualizing an object which has more than three spatial dimensions, such as some mathematical constructs, very strange — one of the more common ways of doing so is essentially taking 3-dimensional "slices" of a 4D object, and presenting them in series over time. Similarly, human brains are designed to only perceive one dimension of time. Time and space aren't intrinsically different from one-another, so in the same way that a 1-dimensional being could not perceive the concept of turning around, we can only see the flow of time in one direction. If the universe had two or more dimensions of time, then you could "turn around" and face the past. What that would look like is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Even the concept of the <em>third</em> dimension can be mind-blowing to some people. Various conditions like <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia">amblyopia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> exist, which can inhibit or remove depth perception. As an attempt to explain it to normal people, imagine only viewing the world through the screen on a digital camera.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html">Blind spots<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Your brain compensates for the existing blind spots in your eyes (spots which are not covered with cones or rods due to the presence of the optical nerve), filling in the lost information. People who get retinal burns (because of handling lasers or arc welders carelessly, for example) get additional blind spots in addition to the natural ones. The brain input-processing mechanism conceals these spots and the afflicted human thinks he's perfectly okay, up until the point that enough of his retina is burned that the brain is no longer able to compensate.
</li><li> Extremely distant objects in the sky are so far away that the brain does not naturally model them as being three-dimensional objects in space. This is especially true of the Sun, Moon, and stars, all of which are huge objects which are extremely large distances away, but the brain does not naturally perceive them as large, nor accurately model their distance, due to lack of perspective.
</li><li> This is why the moon <strong>appears</strong> to be larger when it is low on the horizon versus up in the sky. There isn't an atmospheric lensing effect as many people believe, it's simply a visual illusion. The exact reasons <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion">are still debated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — sometimes it's stated to be because there are trees/buildings/the ground now visible in proximity to it and your brain is better able to judge a relative size, but it seems to work just as well with a featureless sea as the background. Another explanation is that we are simply used to objects on the horizon being smaller, but the moon doesn't become smaller, so we automatically compensate.
</li><li> Even non-celestial distant objects can mess with the brain's perception if there is no relative comparison. Just look at a plane in the sky, you have no way of judging how high or how fast it is moving other than "it's small so it's got to be pretty high". From the ground 2 planes (or their contrails) could appear to intersect with each other and nearly collide, when in actuality there may be 2 miles or more difference in their altitudes. Without perspective the brain just gives up and renders it as a 2D image.
</li><li> Forget vision. ALL your senses are essentially lying to you 24/7. There's nothing inherently "sweet" about sugar. There's nothing inherently "loud" about a gunshot. There's nothing inherently "painful" about a stubbed toe. These are simply the signals your body sends to your brain, in order for your body to find the most desirable environment. Just ask anyone who lacks vision, or hearing, or smell, or taste, or any other sense — they simply aren't able to detect it, thanks to something in their body and/or brain not functioning the way it should. As a matter of fact, their experiences are arguably far closer to reality!
</li></ul></li><li> Because the brain is essentially a very complicated computer made out of meat, brain damage can severely mess up people's perception of reality.
<ul><li> A patient with the two hemispheres of their brain severed may be asked to pick up an object with one hand, pick up the object named, but then call the object by the wrong name when they are asked what object it is, or vice-versa. Such people may also only be able to solve math shown to one of their eyes; if it is shown to the wrong eye exclusively, they may not be able to properly solve the problem.
</li><li> Left side paralysis caused by brain damage, not direct nerve damage, leads to the common illusion that the non-functioning body parts belong to somebody else. The reason is that since the damage originates from the brain, there is no feedback from the limbs to signal that something is wrong with them, since they are technically totally functional. Therefore, the brain invents the idea that the limbs must belong to somebody else. In cognitive science, this is referred to as confabulation. It is actually rather scary that a person under such an illusion is more or less incapable of understanding that they ARE, in fact, not right. They will acknowledge any arguments made by people trying to convince them, but they will not change their mind. When the brain no longer needs to delude itself, people are confused how they could have ever believed something so ridiculous. In some cases, the same defensive mental mechanism reoccurs, and people conveniently forget their previous puzzlement. It should be noted, this happens in people who are otherwise perfectly reasonable, sane and rational, as far as it is possible to judge.
</li><li> We rely on our memories far more than we realize, so it's next to impossible to put yourself in the place of someone who has Retrograde (loss of old memories) or Anterograde (inability to form new memories) Amnesia. As a result of damage, their brains simply lose the ability to store neural information.
</li><li> Aphasia. Depending on the type, someone can understand speech but not produce it, produce speech but not understand it, have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">extremely limited vocabulary</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">completely lose all understanding of language</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">Synesthesia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another odd side effect of how brains function. Someone with synesthesia not only perceives the world in the same way that others do, but additional senses are stimulated as nerve signals cross over in the brain. Each synesthetic person has their own way in which their senses cross over; some see sounds, or hear colors, or feel colors. This is a very strange sort of qualia, and even two synesthetic people who share the same crossings-over may not perceive them in the same way.
</li><li> Humans are extremely bad at understanding large numbers.
<ul><li> This is a problem when it comes to making decisions, as people will actually end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">caring more about a single person than a thousand people because a single person is easier for them to understand;</a> the same applies to donating money to save a small or large number of geese from an environmental catastrophe — the larger cited number actually drew SMALLER donations in one study.
</li><li> Douglas Adams pointed out that infinity is flat and uninteresting, since it doesn't present magnitude or scale, ergo, really big things are necessary to show just how big it is. A basic example is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex">Googolplex<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a number so large that it cannot be represented longhand, even if we filled the known universe with protons and wrote a zero on each one.
</li><li> An even bigger number is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grahams_number">Graham's number<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which cannot be expressed <em>with any standard system of numerical representation</em> including such things as exponent stacks (e.g. a^b^c^d^e...). However, like all things, it can be expressed using certain specialized forms of recursive notation. Graham's number is the maximum limit of the number of unique variations of a particular problem. The minimal limit, at the time, was thought to be <em><strong>6</strong></em>. It has since been increased to 13. Numbers this large can't be constructed physically, and cannot be simulated on a 1 to 1 basis.
<div class="indent"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TextbookHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TextbookHumor">Clearly, there is some room for improvement, here.</a></em>
</div></li><li> Infinity itself is difficult for most people to understand, and also has very strange consequences, as two infinite quantities are not necessarily equal, and some infinities are, effectively, bigger than others<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4f2oh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4f2oh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4f2oh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example there are an infinite number of natural numbers and an infinite number of irrational numbers, but the second set is larger, because (very roughly) even if one were to get to the "end" of natural numbers, one could not do the same with irrational numbers</span>. Related to this is infinitesimal, which is a something that can only be described as a value that is infinitely small, but still reasonably significant. It's probably first heard when taking a physics class or learning about integrals. There are also an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, or indeed, between any two values.
</li></ul></li><li> Fractals.
<ul><li> Their number of dimensions varies whether it's topological or not, and their "true" (Hausdorff) number of dimensions is often non-integer. The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge">Menger sponge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for example, is an object which has zero volume and an infinite surface area. Which means that any Menger sponge you'll see is only an approximation.
</li><li> For another example, look at <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi&lt;!--C5--&gt;84ski_triangle">Sierpinski's Triangles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (imagine a Triforce where you replace every triangle with another Triforce ad infinitum). It has roughly 1.585 dimensions (more precisely, log(3)/log(2).
</li><li> Averted in general with mathematics and geometry, however; while these things might be difficult to <em>visualize</em>, people with the right mathematical training <em>are</em> able to fully understand mathematical concepts on their own "true" terms without resorting to visual metaphors (in fact, learning to do this is essential to progress; <em>not</em> learning to do this is a large part of why some people find math hard).
</li></ul></li><li> Although imaginary numbers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, they actually have, more or less, practical and perhaps physical applications. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThatOtherWiki">That Other Wiki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Applications">has plenty of examples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Your own incompetence. Competency in a task is linked to your ability to judge your ability at said task; thus, incompetent people, with no training in the task, will consider themselves to be vastly more competent than they actually are. This is known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect;<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> however, it can be mitigated with training. Unfortunately, the very incompetence of the people may prevent them from seeking out said training, because they don't realize how incompetent they actually are. There is one exception to this rule: studies of people with clinical depression revealed that many individuals with depression have a far more realistic grasp of their own limitations than the average person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoranceIsBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoranceIsBliss">Think about that for a second.</a>
</li><li> Particles at the quantum level. To clarify, most subatomic particles exhibit 'wave-particle duality', meaning sometimes they behave like a wave, sometimes like a particle, and their true nature (if indeed they have one) is neither. In fact the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle essentially states that the more you know about one's position, the less you know about its speed or trajectory and visa versa. The kicker comes when you learn that this is not due to a shortcoming in our measuring equipment, but a law of the universe itself; there is a hard limit on how much the universe will allow you to learn about a particle, since the mere act of observing changes its nature. Since our brains are evolved to deal with concepts on the macroscopic scale, this is very hard to imagine.
</li><li> Dark Matter/Energy. A postulated form of "something" that makes up over 90% of the universe but does not have any interaction with the electromagnetic spectrum. In fact the only "Observable" effect, and hint that it exists, is its effect on gravity. Humans (and all life as we know it) is made of "normal" matter and evolved to perceive the world through a thin slice of the EM spectrum. Through technology we have been able to extend that thin slice to allow use to visualize other parts of the EM spectrum (which really makes another example of this trope: we cannot grasp the true form of any part of the EM spectrum except for the visible spectrum, only convert it into visual light which we are able to understand), but we are still limited to the parts of the universe that are also able to interact with the EM spectrum. Something that doesn't interact with it is therefore completely unimaginable.
</li><li> All of Planck's constants are incomprehensible except two: Planck mass and Planck energy. The rest describe things like smallest unit of time or length to maximum temperature. Planck mass, while describing something on the quantum level, is the mass of a flea egg, while Plank energy is a tank of gasoline.
</li><li> The concept of a timeless universe.
<ul><li> According to this idea, the flow of time as we perceive, from past to future, is just an illusion. We 3D beings are only capable of perceiving small points in time (the fourth dimension) happening around us, while there is no intrinsic difference between any given point. They are all as real as ever conceivable point in space. A good comparison would be to look at a river. The entire river exists regardless of our position in it, but we can only see the portion we are swimming in right now. Technically speaking, this also means everything that ever has and ever will happen is happening all at once.
</li><li> If you could see yourself in the fourth dimension, you'd look like a huge worm made of every single version of yourself from every moment across your entire life. There would be your embryo at one end and your deceased self at the other. All of this is without getting into the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">branching pathways.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The amount of radiation in the universe that we can perceive is infinitesimally small. If the entire EM spectrum were laid out from one end of the United States to the end, the visible light portion would be 1/100th the thickness of a piece of paper. That is everything our eyes can detect. Just try and imagine Radio waves, X-rays, or Gamma rays on their own, without any false color images.
</li><li> There are <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)">certain places<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the universe that contain...nothing. Nothing whatsoever. Not just no stars, galaxies, or planets, but absolutely <em>no matter or energy whatsoever.</em> No atoms, no subatomic particles, no electromagnetic radiation, not even any indirect signs of dark matter. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot#Supervoid">One of the largest of these<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is almost <strong>four billion</strong> light years across. A space four thousand times bigger than our galaxy, and it's completely empty.
</li><li> The universe itself. It goes on forever, has no boundaries, but is at the same time, finite<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5a1id');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5a1id" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5a1id');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">but, very likely, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#The_Universe_versus_the_observable_universe">far larger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> than the part we can see from Earth, and perhaps even infinite</span>. If you were able to move infinitely fast, you would just end up where you started. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson">Bill Bryson</a> used this example to try to explain it in <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em>: Imagine a two-dimensional being who comes through a dimensional portal to Earth. He tries to determine the size of Earth by traveling along its surface in a straight line, but keeps coming back to his starting point, and can't figure out how he did it. This is what is happening in the universe, which is "curving" in a way that our brains just can't really grasp. Just try to conceive how this can happen. <br/>And there's the issue of attempting to grasp its size: If the distances just in our Solar System are already mind-numbing, a light-year is almost <em>ten trillion kilometers</em>, but at galactic (short of cosmological) scale is insignificant (just our galaxy, the Milky Way, has a size of one hundred thousand times that and the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest major galaxy, is at more than 2.5 million l.y.). That justifies to a point why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale</a> — simply put, even astronomers cannot really wrap their heads around what those distances really mean.
</li><li> A lot of the really pioneering minds in advanced mathematics tend to have at at least minor breakdowns now and then, particularly those studying esoteric things like set theory (aka infinity + 1), alternative systems of math like knot theory, and those studying problems which may or may not actually have solutions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">Apparently, it's hard on a brain to spend your days trying to grasp the true form of things that exist in fractional dimensions braided around a 4-sphere</a>.
</li><li> Negative mass. Try and imagine holding an object that weights -5 kilograms.
<ul><li> An object like that would probably float and/or repell anything. It probably (thankfully) only exists as a thought experiment since it violates various core laws of the universe as we understand it at least, but to quote Seamus Zelazny Harper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> in regards to negative atomic mass: "That's like a planet with a negative number of moons." Only, in his universe, that stuff actually exists and it's suitably terrifying.
</li></ul></li><li> Tornadoes in open fields. Most people who witness a massive tornado in empty fields, find themselves confused if the funnel is moving towards them or just sitting stationary. This is due to humans having difficulty with comprehending spatial awareness and object enormity without having a reference point. The effect will often make it seem like the tornado isn't moving - maybe even moving away - when in actuality it's coming straight for you.
</li><li> Similarly, oceans. Standing on a beach, your horizon is, at most 5 kilometres distant. If you were looking at the Pacific, the nearest landmass (assuming you weren't EXCEPTIONALLY lucky enough for your geodesic to intersect with an island) would be <em>one third of the world</em> away.
</li><li> The concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">Cessation of Existence</a> after death. Try and imagine what true oblivion is — you perceive nothing, you feel nothing, you remember nothing, and you <em>ARE</em> nothing. You can't. You simply can't.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rosencrantz:</strong> We might as well be dead. Do you think death could possibly be a boat? <br/><strong>Guildenstern:</strong> No, no, no... Death is...not. Death isn't.

</div></li><li> Sleep. When you do it, it might feel like a sudden stop and start, but your brain doesn't actually shut down. You simply lose conscious control for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours while your body acts on its own, maintaining its vitals and keeping you busy with dreams until you wake back up. Most of what happens then doesn't even stick and will be forgotten the moment you wake up. Since the brain is still active, we don't even know the true purpose of sleep in the first place. All we know for sure is, if we go too long without it, we die.
</li><li> Someone else's thoughts. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> put it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em>, "No one is told any story but their own."
<ul><li> While you might be able to get a sense of what someone else is thinking, you can never tell exactly what someone else has on their mind. You can't climb into their consciousness and experience the world through their perceptions. The way colors, smells, sounds, and language are interpreted in your brain are completely unique to you and only you. This is the only way you'll experience the world your entire life. We aren't even born with the ability to consider that other people can have different perspectives and mental representations than our own.
</li><li> There's no solid way of knowing what another person would do in your place. Even if it's someone you're close friends with or a family member you've know your whole life, you'll never know for certain what they would do in your place. Everyone has their own views on morality, truth, fairness, justice, mercy, acceptance, etc. Unless a person tells you outright what they think about something, you'll never know for certain how they interpret it. You'll never know if they're on your side or if they disagree with you completely.
</li><li> This state of mental variation means all of us are truly unique. Something you dislike about yourself might actually be something another person really loves about you. The people around you can still manage to surprise you, even if you've known them for years. Most importantly, even if it feels like you're the only one in the world who feels a certain way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">there are countless other people who have an idea of what you're going through. Not a total sense of what you're feeling, but an idea of it. People who care about you and want you to be happy. Many of them have greater knowledge and experience than you and are more than happy to share it. All you have to do is ask.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Many people on the autistic spectrum describe their perception of the world around them in this way due to the way they process sensory input. <em>Aquamarine Blue 5</em>, a book of essays written by autistics, describes experiences like these.
</li><li> If the "Interface Theory of Perception" is to be believed, this is an <em>evolutionary mechanic</em>. The gist of its argument is that each species has evolved a unique visual perception of reality to benefit their unique behavior. A good metaphor compares our perception of reality to the user interface of a computer, which masks the complex, inner workings of a computer from the user. To test this phenomenon, an "interface game" was set up to determine which of two groups would survive: organisms that perceive an objective reality versus organisms that perceive a subjective reality. <strong>The truth-perceiving organisms died out.</strong>
</li><li> People exposed to something that they have literally no frame of reference for in their prior experience often flail to construct what they are seeing in their minds. A classic example is the Native Americans believing Cortez's horsemen were giant creatures with two heads, because they had never seen a horse, let alone a man riding one, before (it's believed that myths of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent">centaurs</a> similarly originated from garbled memories that the Greeks had of horse-riding invaders from before tamed horses were a common sight in Eurasia). Another example is the crazed German private who babbled to his superior about "a crocodile in the trenches" upon seeing a tank for the first time.
<ul><li> A fictional example of this would be how the rabbits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em> perceive motor vehicles; they see them as giant creatures called "hrududu".
</li></ul></li><li> Humans are terrible at processing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">large scales of time.</a> To give you an example, let's say that the entire history of the Earth was condensed into 24 hours. It takes the planet about eight-ten minutes to initially form, the moon forms five minutes later, and the planet takes about an hour to cool enough for water to form. Life don't come into existence until around four and a half later, and it takes another six hours for bacteria as we know it to even form. The first multi-cellular organisms don't emerge until <em>8:30 PM</em> on the clock. Where do humans fall on this clock? If four billion years are condensed into 24 hours, then we first emerged at 11:58:43 PM. Our modern civilization? <em>Not even a full second.</em> And this is without even getting into the timescales of the universe, which is over 3 times older than Earth. Good luck wrapping your mind around all that.
<ul><li> To expand on the human point, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133807-our-species-may-be-150000-years-older-than-we-thought/">a recent archaeological discovery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> found that the human race may be 150,000 years older than we previously thought. That would bump up our time frame on the clock by about...12 seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes, noises synthesized using specific hardware or software will make the noise sound "off" when played on different programs. This happens quite a bit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a> or even PC noises.
<ul><li> A good example of this are Lavos's Roar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> and Odio's St. Alicia attack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive">Live A Live</a></em>. It's actually rather difficult to replicate the noises during emulation, which is why you can often look up videos of them and hear something <em>completely</em> different than what you remember when played.
</li><li> MIDI music made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurnOfTheMilennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurnOfTheMilennium">The Turn Of The Milennium</a> can also result in the sounds either sounding weird, or simply not playing because the computer doesn't know how to play back that sound, or it plays it differently. Othertimes they can devolve into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">weird sounds</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> To someone with dyscalculia or Dyslexia, this is how numbers and words can be seen as them, respectively. Everyone else sees something that they just <em>cannot</em> perceive in any way.
<ul><li> Sometimes, you don't even have to be Dyscalculic to feel this with math — one reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesMathematics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesMathematics">Everyone Hates Mathematics</a> is that as any math teacher can tell you, once you hit Calculus, half the class will understand what you are saying (or even what they are seeing) while the others will interpret it as scribbles and jargon. The only way they can comprehend it will amount to making the <em>teacher</em> feel they cannot grasp the true form of how they perceive mathematics.
</li></ul></li><li> As difficult as it is to imagine long stretches of time, shorter ones may be even worse. The smallest duration of time humanity has ever been able to measure is 12 attoseconds. 1 attosecond is one quintillionth of a second, which is how long it takes for a photon to travel the length of two hydrogen atoms. To put it in another perspective, if you were immortal and could perceive things in an attosecond time frame, light would seem frozen to you. You could live out the entire age of the universe, from its birth to the end of star formation, in the time it would take the average person to <em>blink.</em>
</li><li> Linguistics. Some letters and words have no equivalent in other languages. While some languages make up for this by having the word be untranslated and taking it as a loanword (Especially common in English and Creole languages), others make the best guess they got. Reading some older works that were translated often include notes mentioning how the words can have different meanings and it's all based upon interpretation. This is also one of the reasons why some words are frequently mispronounced by non-native speakers — since the letters all have a completely different sound (or no equivalent) in other languages.
<ul><li> When you get to languages that are even older, it gets even more complicated. For example, the letters Tl — which do not normally go together in English — are not unheard of in some Native American tribes (Tlingit, Tlaxcala)
</li><li> We know mostly of the Greek pronunciations of some deities, words, or names in Egyptian mythology because the only way their names were written down (That we know of, or can even translate) could not be translated. This is especially the case with the Egyptian deity Thoth. "Thoth" is actually his Greek name — his Egyptian name was pronounced <em>way</em> differently. This is lampshaded when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> has the characters meet him, he has no real way to spell his Egyptian name in English, so he pronounces it phonetically as the only way the English speaking Kanes (and the audience) can understand.
</li><li> This is also a reason behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">Unfortunate Name</a> for some people — "Shit" to an Indian person would be pronounced as "Shee", yet English speakers see names like "Akshit" or "Dikshit" and pronounce them as "Ack-shit" or "Dick-shit".
</li></ul></li><li> The singularity of a black hole. Try and wrap your mind around an object with infinite density and a volume of zero.
</li><li> There's a phenomenon named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking">saccadic masking:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> basically, your eyes are constantly making movements as you look around (which are called saccades). As you may have noticed, your eyes don't scroll from one object you're looking at to another like a video camera, but instead seem to abruptly "cut" from one "shot" to another. This is because the brain edits these out for a number or reasons (seeing them would take more brainpower, most of them would be too blurry to be useful, and you'd likely get dizzy.)
