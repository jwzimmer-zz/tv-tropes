</p><p>A character thinks he can speak Hungarian (or whatever), but fails comedically and says something entirely different than what was intended — often complete nonsense or something rude. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Consulting a (dirty) Hungarian-to-English phrasebook, he then proceeds to walk into a tobacco shop and asks the guy at the counter, "Can I please buy some matches?" but he ends up actually saying</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">"My hovercraft is full of eels."</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</p><p>This typically has nothing to do with bad translations; the original speech was incorrect. For bad translations, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EitherWorldDominationOrSomethingAboutBananas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EitherWorldDominationOrSomethingAboutBananas">Either "World Domination", or Something About Bananas</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck">Translation Train Wreck</a>. However, if the language being spoken isn't the language of the work as a whole, there's usually a translation back so that the audience can see just how wrong the character's speech actually was. For example, Bob thinks he speaks French well. He speaks in French to a waiter, who looks at him oddly and says "Monsieur, I do not think that you really meant to say that there is a blue banana in your navel."
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Although this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, rare serious examples are known to exist where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>.
</p><p>This is only rarely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, mostly in relation to tonal languages such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage">Mandarin Chinese</a> and specific <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">"false friends"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (such as the Spanish word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMyLanguageThatSoundsLike">"embarazada," meaning "pregnant"</a>). Most of the time, someone who speaks a language poorly just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue">speaks it slowly, with a poor accent, and stumbling over vocabulary and grammar.</a> Even if this does occur, the listener can usually tell what mistake the speaker made; if someone said "I like to eat pincakes," in English, you wouldn't assume that they are thinking of some sort of cake made from pins. <em>In English</em>, "My hovercraft is full of eels" sounds nothing like what the speaker intended to say, but the mistake was made because it <em>does</em> sound at least somewhat similar in the language in question.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Also happens sometimes with written language: some languages (such as Hungarian and Arabic) rely on diacritics to distinguish similar-looking words, and ideographic languages (such as Chinese and Japanese) have complicated characters whose meaning (and pronunciation) can completely change with the difference of a few strokes.
</p><p>A common explanation for the trope is that the character making the mistake has been taught something rude by a mischievous native speaker, playing on their ignorance to purposefully give an obscene translation for something reasonable.
</p><p>A subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithForeignLanguages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithForeignLanguages">Fun with Foreign Languages</a>. Often used in conjunction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EloquentInMyNativeTongue">Eloquent in My Native Tongue</a>. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EitherWorldDominationOrSomethingAboutBananas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EitherWorldDominationOrSomethingAboutBananas">Either "World Domination", or Something About Bananas</a>, which is about inept translations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">Separated by a Common Language</a>, in which similar problems happen because of differences in dialect, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a>, a character who does this in their <em>native</em> language. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinnerOrderFlub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinnerOrderFlub">Dinner Order Flub</a> is this applied to restaurant settings.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedToGoIronMyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedToGoIronMyDog">I Need to Go Iron My Dog</a> (which, though, is a totally legit result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels">My Hovercraft Is Full of Eels</a> if your first language is Russian: "to pet a dog" and "to iron a dog" sound identical in that language).
</p><p>Note: If you are interested in learning how to say that your hovercraft is full of eels in many languages, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.omniglot.com/">Omniglot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/hovercraft.htm">useful compilation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> Around the mid-to-late 2010s, Rita's Italian Ice (a chain of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_ice">water ice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shops based in the Philadelphia area) introduced a Swedish Fish flavor. To advertise this flavor, they have a mock Swedish language lesson, where you are supposed to repeat after the lady who is saying phrases in Swedish. The last phrase is "Min svävare är full med ålar," which translates to this trope.
</li><li> Mitsubishi had a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njp9yTD2uvA">TV ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a pre-<em>Buffy</em> Robia La Morte driving a red open roadster, following along to a 'Learn Italian' cassette. At a stop sign a man hears her and says in Italian (subtitled) "You speak my language!" — she breezily replies in Italian (subtitled) "Good toast, waiter! ...I would like a slice of suitcase." and drives off, the picture of self-assurance.
</li><li> A German <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNCIQeeAbw">beer commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had Indian businessmen in a beer garden doing this. When the waitress arrives, one of them says "Ich möchte diesen Teppich nicht kaufen." (I do not want to purchase this carpet). The waitress just nods and proceeds to serve them the advertised beer brand with the businessmen happily accepting, wishing her a "Gute Reise" (nice journey).
</li><li> One of the "Get a Mac" ads in the UK had PC attempting to communicate with a Japanese printer (Mac had language compatibility and could do so). He spouted the phrases "I am a rice cake" and "Where is the train station?"
</li><li> A German commercial used a well known joke to advertise a language course. It has German coastguard responding to an English language distress call, "We're sinking! We're sinking!" with "What are you sinking about?"
</li><li> A Canadian grocery store had a campaign advertising its new French breads, in which a baker would speak French and the subtitles would show that he was saying how great the bread was. In a hilarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a>, the baker was actually repeating common high school French or phrasebook sentences, like "Where is the library?"
<ul><li> Canada is officially bilingual with a significant population of fully bilingual citizens. And most Canadians have enough mandatory French education to at least recognize the "phrasebook sentences" don't match the subtitle.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a West African hot pepper sauce which is very popular among African exiles in Britain and available from ethnic food retailers. In Ghana, its name simply means "pepper sauce." But it won't be on general sale anywhere else in a hurry, though, as the brand name is "Shitto," or "Shitto Gourmet." It does actually taste rather good, it has to be said, like tabasco, jerk sauce, or peri-peri.
</li><li> The Mexican brand of snacks and baked goods called "Bimbo." It actually is available in the English-speaking world, probably because its name isn't quite an obscenity, but it still causes snickers, maybe more so now that Bimbo products have begun to fill in the market hole left behind by Hostess's bankruptcy in the US.
<ul><li> If you live in Southern California, you don't give these a second thought. They're the predominant brand.
</li><li> They also helpfully provide a pronunciation guide on their ads. It's pronounced "Beem-bo".
</li></ul></li><li> A MasterCard commercial has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover">Latin Lover</a> ask "¿Cómo te llamas?" which the subtitles correctly translate as "What is your name?" and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateMcKinnon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateMcKinnon">white paramour</a> respond "Yo soy camarones," which the subtitles are equally correct in rendering as "I am shrimp."
</li><li> Another credit card commercial had an Australian tourist approaching a French policeman to ask directions to the Eiffel Tower. He's placed under arrest after saying, "I wish to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">mount your tower, could you expose yourself to me?</a>"
</li><li> An <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEuh17Uik7k">ad for the language-learning app FluentU<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> compares a man, Dave, attempting to apply knowledge he obtained from language-learning books and a woman, Cindy, who learned the language through FluentU. While Cindy is doing well because she's been watching media in the local language, poor Dave is far less successful because he's only been taught "boring grammar and phrases he would never use", and he ends up unwittingly insulting several people.

<ul><li> This happens to Kagura in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>. Upon seeing a foreign tourist struggling with his luggage, she decides to go help him. He's quite shocked to see this girl suddenly yell "Help! Help me!" at the top of her lungs when trying to talk to him. She eventually does get her intended message across, but when the foreigner thanks her, all she can come up with in response is "Yay!" accompanied by a thumbs up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of the English character Laura Stuart trying to speak Japanese, only for the others to point out that it is all wrong. This is because Motoharu Tsuchimikado taught her, and he enjoys screwing with people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutariEcchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutariEcchi">Futari Ecchi</a></em> has a scene wherein an American businessman's daughter mixes up her words and instead of complimenting the flavor of the crab being served, she was commenting on a certain portion of the male anatomy.
</li><li> For some reason, Kagura in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> feels the need to say "help me!" in English, but since her pronunciation is off, it starts as "health me!" and ends up as "herpes me!" and "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a>!</em>"
</li><li> One short in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> had Kagami talking about Taifuu Ikka (ikka = kanji for one and 'pass over') which refers to the calm after a typhoon has passed. Konata starts talking about the "Typhoon family" to which Kagami replies "Are you serious?" Ikka also can mean "family" if a different kanji is used. Tsukasa, of course, doesn't get why Konata's statement was silly.
<ul><li> In another example, the girls talk about something fairly mundane, then the word "ichigo" falls. Ichigo can also mean "strawberry," prompting Tsukasa to request some, confusing the others in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shortly after arriving in Japan, Albert Chamomile tries to tell Negi that Nodoka is being attacked by... well, we don't know exactly what he was <em><strong>trying</strong></em> to say, because the Japanese word he used means "fried chicken" (perhaps he meant "jellyfish"). Note that Chamo didn't have any reason to speak Japanese, as Negi is also a native speaker of English. Interestingly, this wouldn't be the last reference to fried chicken we'd see in this series...

<ul><li> Ami's is only barely better than Makoto's, really. It's not that there's anything <em>technically</em> wrong with her greeting, but considering she's meeting a stranger for the first time, "I'm glad to see you" is hardly a fitting greeting.

"English for Advanced (Learners)"). The trick was often to "translate" English phrases into something that sounds like it in German but makes the phrase gibberish. Thus, "O, the bell rings!" is translated as <em>O, der bello ringt!</em> ("Oh, the dog wrestles!" — <em>Bello</em> is a stock name for a dog in German, much like "Spot" in English, and <em>ringen</em> really means "to wrestle").

She says, "We am thy freighter Ursva condemning things and supplies." The Klingons find the phrase humorous and respond with "Don't catch any bugs!" and hearty laughter; to maintain the ruse, the Enterprise crew responds with forced laughter. The film's novelization explains that the Klingon guards actually <em>weren't</em> fooled by Uhura's clumsy translation. The just assumed the "Ursva" were incompetent (or drunk) smugglers, and let them through out of pity.

He makes two mistakes. First, he uses the greeting of the rightward schism in the language of the leftward schism, and second, his appalling accent turns "I offer you the bread of life" into the nonsensical "Let us violate cakes together."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSagaOfTheNobleDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSagaOfTheNobleDead">The Saga of the Noble Dead</a></em>, half-elf Leesil was never properly taught the Elvish language. His later attempts to learn it go poorly; the first time he actually tries speaking to an elf, he manages to turn a request for directions into an insult against the elf's mother.
</li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSaddleClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSaddleClub">The Saddle Club</a></em> series while Lisa and her family are on vacation in Italy. Lisa is given a cot with a broken wheel and tries to explain it to the front desk staff, but even with her English-to-Italian dictionary, the closest she can manage is "the wheel on top of my bed is broken." In this case she <em>knows</em> that it's not quite right, but she decides to use it anyway in hopes that they'll understand what she's trying to get at. Fortunately, they do.

The saboteur(s) who had altered the ship's logs to make it look like the Enterprise had fired on the Chancellor's ship had also wiped the Klingon language data from the memory banks specifically to keep the Enterprise from being able to properly communicate when they crossed into Klingon space. The books were part of Uhura's personal collection, not part of the ship's library, so they were not affected. The Klingons that were encountered, fortunately, figured anyone that sounded so incompetent had to be petty smugglers and were therefore not worth the trouble of stopping.

At one point, he gives his profession as "fishing boat" (he <em>meant</em> "merchant trader"), but for good reason: he physically <em>can't</em> pronounce the distinction between the two words. Thrawn, on the other hand, has no trouble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot">picking up Basic</a> while trying to teach that main character.

"My Buttocks" becomes the translator's nickname among the tribesmen.
</li><li> One anecdote in the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThreeMenInABoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThreeMenInABoat">Three Men in a Boat</a></em>, set in Germany, has George bewildered when he tries to buy a cushion from a German shop and the three young sales girls throw him out. Turns out the word George had used for 'cushion' was <em>Kussen</em>, which sounds very similar to the word for 'to kiss' ("<em>küssen</em>"); made even more hilarious by the fact that the correct German word would be <em>Kissen</em>.

But what she ends up saying by accident is "Hey, sparkling teeth, I totally love three of your claws but not the others, and I wish your nose was a herring so I can eat it, and also your wings sound like sharks snoring."
</li><li> The 1993 edition of the Collins-Robert English-French dictionary has twin introductions (one in French and one in English) about how to use the resources it contains to make sure you use the correct translation. Each introduction begins with an example of how weird one can sound with the wrong words.
<ul><li> The French language introduction opens with someone trying to say that "He was run over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">a truck that jumped the light</a>," but instead says "Il a été débordé par un diable qui a sauté le mou." ("He was overflowed by a devil that leapt the soft") Correct is "Il fut/a été écrasé par un camion qui brula/a brulé le feu rouge." It goes on to talk about how different English translations of the French "sauter" could have one talking about a cork fusing instead of popping out, etc.
</li><li> The English language introduction opens with someone trying to say "Be careful not to get run over; you have to walk on the pedestrian crossing," (in French "Attention de ne vous faire écraser; il faut marcher dans les clous") but instead says, "Attention not to make yourself squash; you have to walk inside the nails." It goes on to talk about how different French translations of the English "to cut" could have one talking about mowing a disc, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> The book <em>Brighter Than A Thousand Suns</em> is a history of the discovery of atomic fission and the development of the atom bomb, but an early scene in a German university town features a foreign student rushing into a shop and making an improper request of a shopkeeper's daughter. It turns out that in German if you switch a couple of vowel sounds then "Do you have a scale? I want to weigh something" comes out as "Do you have a cradle? I want to do something risky."

<ul><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlloAllo">'Allo 'Allo!</a></em> dread the appearance of Crabtree, "that English idiot who thinks he can speak French." While he technically knows the right words, his pronunciation is horrific and he usually comes out with ridiculous (and sometimes naughty-sounding) sentences such as "I was pissing (passing) by your coffee (café)." Of course, what's interesting is that this relies on the understanding that although the dialogue is in clear (if accented) English, the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">are actually "speaking" -- and understanding -- French</a>. And Crabtree's dialogue is attempting to represent how a very bad French speaker would come across to them. Somehow the Germans never seem to suspect that he's a spy rather than a genuine French policeman.

It was easy for Tammy and Victor since they spoke the language, but Kisha and Jen had a little difficulty: instead of ordering "New Taste Beef" they ordered "Oil Comes Again to Please the Mouth," and "Golden Pork Spare Ribs" got lost in translation as "Light Competition Red Dishes I've Played Before."

Since Vedran is a made-up language, there is, understandably, no way to verify that. He also tries to brag to Beka that he can speak "Old Earth Gaelic" by stating "Love is my language;" unfortunately, he ended up saying "Love is our sandwich." He was speaking fluent Vedran (among dozens of other alien languages including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Than</a>) earlier in the same episode and even singing in them.

<ul><li> Ivanova tries to show Marcus and Delenn how she's been learning Minbari and can therefore command the Minbari crew of the <em>White Star</em>. Her attempt is subtitled "Engines at full, high power, hatrack ratcatcher, to port weapons, brickbat lingerie."
</li><li> After Delenn has diplomatically suggested that Ivanova allow herself or Marcus to translate her orders to the White Star crew and Ivanova has gone out of earshot, Delenn orders Marcus to warn the crew that anyone who laughs at Ivanova's... <em>creative</em>... Minbari will answer to her personally. Given how most Minbari are depicted as being rather stoic, anything that could make them laugh would probably have to be quite a howler...
<ul><li> In a later episode, it is revealed that Minbari humor focuses on both puns and failure to attain enlightment, so it's likely that the usually serious crew would have found Ivanova's mixups hilarious.
</li></ul></li><li> She pulls another one later, while ranting, in her broken Minbari, about their current situation. She ends her rant with an exclamation of "Ah, Hell!" — in English, of course. The Minbari weapons officer, however, promptly opens fire on absolutely nothing. When Ivanova seems completely confused by this, Lorien explains that "Ahell" means "rapid, continuous fire" in Minbari. There were numerous occasions to throw in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to this later; alas, the series never does.
</li><li> In season two, the new commanding officer of Babylon 5 is attacked by a Minbari and defends himself with a conveniently-placed weapon. When Sheridan has the assailant at his mercy, he demands surrender — to which the Minbari replies, "Death first." Later on, in a pseudo-legal proceeding, a Minbari witness claims the assailant actually said something that sounds similar ("Deth feherst" or some such) but means "I yield to your authority." This actually turned out to be a complete lie, but the other Minbari seemed to consider it plausible.

The titular character is covering for the president of a fictional country(who happens to be in the hospital recovering from a poisoning attempt that morning.) A government official who thinks he's addressing the actual President tells Benson what he thinks is the saying for "Thank you very much." Benson, not knowing a lick of the real thing, makes it up on the spot that the way the guy just phrased it, "It was an insult to my mother."

"Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen!" and "Don't call the library. Show me your mucus!" or even this: "Your monkey sleeps inside me." The Chinese restaurant owner refers to Howard as the annoying little friend of theirs "who thinks he speak Mandarin," making this a likely case of being taught wrong. Of course, knowing Howard, he probably did this on purpose to screw with Sheldon.

<ul><li> In another episode, Angela is trying to put together a toy for her son, but the included instructions say things like "put to bumblebee make happy." The illustrations aren't any more helpful, so she winds up paying three times more to get an associate at the store to put it together for her.

She says, "La vache doit me touche de la jeudi" in an <em>atrocious</em> accent with English pronunciations. This means (roughly) what they say it does, with a few caveats. First, the indicative present "doit" means "must;" to get "should," one should use the conditional "devrait." Second, she conjugates the verb "toucher" ("to touch") rather than using the infinitive. Finally, her use of the definite article "la" before "jeudi" ("Thursday") is nonsensical. The last could possibly be interpreted to mean "every Thursday," but that makes even less sense; one would use the definite article "le" instead, since days of the week are grammatically masculine, not grammatically feminine.</span>

Her initial attempts were a little less than stellar: an attempt to congratulate a newly engaged couple had her unintentionally claiming to be having an affair with the man; and one attempt to converse with her instructor/UST interest resulted in the memorable phrase "Cheese in my pants makes me happy. Don't you agree?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CHiPs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CHiPs">CHiPs</a></em> had an American Sign Language variant: Ponch was telling the deaf parents of a woman that he would bring her home tonight in English, but what he's 'saying' in sign language causes the woman to say, bemusedly, "Ponch, you mixed up some signs.

<div class="indent"><strong>Valens:</strong> (<em>to Rush</em>) He just told them he sits down a lot.
</div></li><li> Several instances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, particularly in the first season while the Study Group takes Spanish:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E01Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E01Pilot">"Pilot"</a>, when Jeff tries to convince Britta that he's a Spanish tutor to get closer to her, she asks him to say that in Spanish, leading to him doing this ("I sleep late Spanish. One more hour. Don't scratch my car"). What he says is actually comprehensible Spanish—specifically, phrases he would presumably have memorized so he could say them to Spanish-speaking hotel maids and valets. Britta knows that he's bullshitting her, but can't prove it because she doesn't speak Spanish.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E24EnglishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E24EnglishAsASecondLanguage">"English as a Second Language"</a>, when Chang's replacement threatens to fail the Study group for walking out of their Spanish final to rescue Annie from Chang, Jeff and Britta respond in perfect Spanish, only for Pierce to do this ("Land of fire!").

She tells him that she already knows how to introduce herself, having been taught by a former boyfriend, and continues: <em>"Bonjour, Ken. Je m'appelle Raquel. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"</em> Which means of course "Hello, Ken. My name is Raquel. Would you like to go to bed with me this evening?" Interestingly, no subtitles were displayed on screen, meaning that any viewers who didn't speak French (or recognize the phrase) would not have understood why Ken got that pained expression on his face...
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em>, in the episode "The Girl with Two Breasts," a scene where Jeff misunderstands Hebrew is played twice — the second time with the Hebrew in English, and Jeff's original English as incomprehensible gibberish. This reveals that Jeff has — in place of the girl's name — been repeating the Hebrew word for "breasts" ("Shadayim").
</li><li> An interesting non-vocal example happened on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>. Supermodel Nyle DiMarco is deaf and relied on visual cues to do the dances. At one point he and his partner were dancing separately and she motioned him to walk over to her; it was supposed to be a flirty "come hither" gesture, but the exact motion she used (with all five fingers) is the ASL sign for "Get over here NOW!" causing Nyle to run to her, which briefly threw off their timing. They were able to play it off though, and viewers were none the wiser.
</li><li> Done twice on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropTheDeadDonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropTheDeadDonkey">Drop the Dead Donkey</a></em>, once with Russian (Henry introduces himself as a pregnant cabbage to a Soviet official on a factfinding exchange) and once with Japanese (Damien tells a group of Japanese businessmen to go and have sex with a porcupine). It's implied in the latter case Damien was told the wrong phrase as a practical joke.
</li><li> The BBC comedy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Episodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Episodes">Episodes</a></em> contains a meta-example. The show's graphics department had prepared a dual Hebrew/English text for a gravestone, but the Hebrew text that was supposed to parallel the English phrase "dearly missed" instead claimed that the deceased had been "pickled at great expense." They had apparently used some kind of translation software that made two major errors: first, it translated "dearly" in the sense of "expensively," and second, it selected the Hebrew word for "missed" that can <em>only</em> be used in the sense of "to miss an opportunity" — a word which, when applied to any other noun, means instead "to pickle" or "to sour." The graphics department then compounded the error by reversing the text of the Hebrew <em>rettel yb rettel</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>:

</li><li> A rare serious example occurs when a Spanish woman was brought in with an overdose, and her husband said she was taking her prescribed medication as instructed. The instructions were only in English and said to take a pill 'once a day', but the Spanish word for 'eleven' is 'once', but with a different pronunciation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She died of the overdose.</span>

Unfortunately, the man doesn't speak English but Niles' maid speaks German...yet she has a very poor grasp of English herself, meaning Frasier has to translate what Niles is saying to Spanish so the maid can translate it <em>again</em> to the fencing instructor. Everything seems to be going fine until Frasier mistranslates "You have stolen Niles' wife" as "You have stolen Niles' shoes." For some reason, this infuriates the guy prompting him and Niles to duel preceded by this priceless exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Niles</strong>: <em>En garde!</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Frasier</strong>: Oh great, that's <em>just</em> what we need! A <strong><em>fourth</em> language!</strong>
</div></li><li> Happens again later in the episode when Frasier tries to tell the fencing instructor that his wife loves him very much, but the maid's confusion with pronouns means it gets translated as "your wife loves me very much." Unsurprisingly, the instructor attacks him too.

Things go south quickly when Douglas forbids her to bring her laptop to the first face to face meeting with the Italian man and her improvised Italian is so awful that no subtitles are even needed to see that she's just speaking English words with a pseudo-Italian tone and intonation.

An unusual example in that it's intentional; Klinger is fluent in Arabic (in fact it's implied to be his first language) and is purposefully stringing together sentences of this type to reinforce the idea that he's delirious from a head injury.

<div class="indent"><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> Everyone was super warm and encouraging as I stumbled through my beginner's Greek, as if they were just flattered that I would even try to speak their language or something, but I ran into a few problems during my time there. I was constantly mixing up words, saying "kiss" when I meant "friend," little things like that. One time I went in to a pharmacy looking for baby powder and got nothing but blank stares when I asked for it at the counter. I learned later what I'd done wrong, and why the lady at the pharmacy had looked so confused; I'd asked her if she had any "baby dust." Another time I caused a minor panic at my host family's house when I took a phone message and announced that their friend Maria had called to say that she had just checked into the hospital. Yeah, she had just checked into a <em>hotel</em>. A pretty important distinction, as I learned after almost giving poor Mr. and Mrs. Mavropoulos heart attacks.

<ul><li> The main character's father Donovan is hilariously inept with the orcish language; while he presumably thinks he's speaking greetings and profound things, he's really spouting nonsense, such as "My landmass erupts with kittens." He also has a very fancy title:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Donovan</strong>: What's so funny? Is "bringer of peace and joy" laughable?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Melna</strong>: No... but that's not what "Kulka Sheendo Dak" means. That's "Kilka Shiendo Dak."

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Melna</strong>: Um... it means "Little Pink Man In Pink."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Donovan</strong>: They lied to me.
</div><ul><li> Later:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Okay, say 'Hello, my name is Donovan Deegan' in Orcish."
</div><div class="indent">"'Fruit. My name is Little Pink Man Who Wears Pink.'"
</div><ul><li> Despite having fun at his expense, the orcs are very respectful of "Uncle Pinky."
</li><li> An orc has been introduced with the same problem, but speaking Callanian. Apparently he learned from Donovan. The orc in question was under the impression that the Callanian phrase for "hello" was "Be afraid! I am very dangerous and I am going to kill you!"
</li><li> As it turns out, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dominic-deegan.com/view.php?date=2010-01-12">Donovan's been faking it the whole time.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Everyone is simply <em>gobsmacked</em> when he recites an orcish saying perfectly.

In one strip she signs by cupping her hand into a "c" and motioning from throat to stomach. He blushes and begins to take off his shirt. Then, noticing her blushing as well, he says, "Oh wait, that means you're <em>hungry,</em>" to which she signs "Yes yes yes." Although the joke is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">clear on its own</a> from both their reactions, the specific mistake Chris made is that making the cupped-hand throat-to-stomach motion <em>once</em> means "I'm hungry," whereas doing it <em>repeatedly</em> means "I'm horny."

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Arabic </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The story is told of an ambassador to an Arabic country, whose wife stood in the bazaar one day shouting "God bless you" (or so <em>she</em> thought) to passers-by. Unfortunately, in Arabic only a very slight difference in pronunciation distinguishes "bless" from "bugger..."
</li><li> Prepositions tend to cause a number of oddities when non-native speakers attempt Arabic, particularly when the speaker has a grasp of basic structure and vocabulary but no understanding of construction. The most commonly told anecdote in Arabic classes involves <em>in</em> and <em>on</em> — "I'm <em>on</em> the bus," for example, would imply that the speaker is riding on top of the vehicle. The preferred construction swaps <em>on</em> with <em>in.</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note81q0o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note81q0o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note81q0o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many, many English speakers make this mistake when learning Arabic abroad, either as part of formal study or due to relocation. It's less likely to be a fatal error if the person you're conversing with knows you're not a native speaker (and accent and appearance almost always give that away instantly).</span>
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Chinese </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Bill Clinton was once giving a speech to a Chinese crowd. He opened by saying "hello" in Chinese, ni(2) hao(3) [你好]. Unfortunately, he pronounced it ni(4) hao(4)[你嚎], coming up with "you are barking." Nobody had the heart to correct him.
</li><li> While not exactly fitting the trope as he wasn't trying to speak Chinese at all, American President Truman once addressed Chiang Kai-Shek as "Mr. Shek" (In Asian languages the last name goes first. In the US he would be named "Mr. Kai Shek Chiang")
</li><li> Linguist David Moser illustrates this trope with an anecdote about practicing his Chinese with some Chinese friends. "I want to go to sleep now," due to tiredness and bad intonation, became "I stand by where the elephant urinates."
</li><li> Another joke also illustrates this, where a speaker is announcing a plentiful harvest. First he tries to say the food is enough [for everyone] to eat (g<strong>ò</strong>u chi le)[食物够吃了], but due to dialectal differences, he says that the food was eaten by dogs (g<strong>ǒ</strong>u chi le)[食物狗吃了]. Then he tries to say "everybody go eat a big bowl [of food]" (da4 jia1 dou1 <strong>shi3</strong> ge da4 <strong>wan3 ba</strong>) [大家都使个大碗吧] but ends up saying "everybody here is a big dumb bastard" (da4 jia1 dou1 <strong>shi4</strong> ge da4 <strong>wang2 ba1</strong>) [大家都是个大王八].
</li><li> This also applies to idioms and synonyms; cue running joke in certain circles where a young man who has recently returned to China eats a meal with relatives he hasn't seen in decades. At the end of the meal, he stands up and says "Wo man le" [我满了] It literally means "I'm full," but full as in physically filled, generally used for inanimate objects. (The proper way to say it is "Wo bao le." [我饱了]) Everyone sitting with him cracked up.
</li><li> Before an official translation occurred, Chinese venders chose random ideographs which pronounced phonetically sounded more or less like the name of Coca Cola but resulted in gems like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole">Bite the Wax Tadpole</a>" and "female horse dipped in wax" (which does sound like something you might encounter in traditional Chinese medicine). The official Chinese name for Coca-Cola now doesn't sound <em>exactly</em> like "Coca-Cola,"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9lsi1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9lsi1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9lsi1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">none of the ideographs with the "la" pronunciation were desirable</span> but it has the advantage of meaning "tasty and fun."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107pzk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107pzk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107pzk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Literally, "Can Mouth Can Happy."</span>
</li><li> Another urban legend tells of how, after mistranslating the phrase "finger lickin' good," KFC ended up advertising its chicken as resulting in the eater biting his own fingers off.
</li><li> A third urban legend tells of Pepsi-Cola accidentally translating their slogan, "Come alive! You're the Pepsi Generation!" as "Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave."

Brings your ancestors back from the grave!"
</li><li> Many Mandarin Chinese speakers not yet familiar with the language may make a mistake when ordering a fried egg. The proper name is "jian dan" [煎蛋]. However, as the word for "deep-fry" is "zha" [炸], the customer may inadvertently order "zha dan" [炸蛋], or a "bomb" [炸弹]. Which, in a food-related context, is one way to refer to Scotch eggs.
</li><li> The Chinese ideogram for the concept of "dry" or "dried" [干] also has a less polite slang meaning and is <a class="urllink" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005195.html">sometimes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mistranslated into English as "fuck." "Gan1" is "dry", while "gan4" is "to do"—with all the implications that may carry in English being equally applicable in Chinese, allowing for context-derived meanings ranging from the innocuous to sexual intercourse, and even "do" as in "done in/killed".
</li><li> Former Canadian politician Jack Layton (RIP) told a story about having dinner with his future mother-in-law, who came from Hong Kong. He tried to say, "Thank you for the good food," in Cantonese, but he used the wrong tone and accidentally said, "Thank you for the good sex." Fortunately, his future mother-in-law was amused rather than offended.
</li><li> A joke about the census; the census worker asked how many people are there. The person replied with <strong>shi4 yi1</strong> kou3 ren2 (one person) [是一口人], but the worker thought he/she said <strong>shi2 yi1</strong> kou3 ren2 (11)[十一口人]. The person tries to tell them that it's just one person [就是一口人], but the results are the worker being surprised. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jiù shì yī [就是一] was mistranslated to 91 [九十一] persons in the household.</span>

</li><li> Careless use of any Pinyin based input programs for Chinese can cause this problem as well, since tone marks are often omitted during input. Unlike most examples above, even native speakers are not immune to this phenomenon, leading to mockery by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazis">Grammar Nazis</a>.
</li><li> Cantonese has quite a few examples as well.
<ul><li> "Ngo5 tou5 ngo6" means "I am hungry". "Ngo5 tou5 o<em>1</em>", on the other hand, means "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">I have explosive diarrhea</a>". It's not helped by the fact that some people pronounce "o1" as "ngo(h)1".
</li><li> It is entirely possible to accidentally swear when learning to count to ten. (Seven - tsat - and nine - gau - are differentiated from two certain swear words by tone only).

Pavel Dostál said he hadn't been able to keep a straight face. He told the poor waiter what had been going on. But <em>he</em> never believed him, thinking that Kundera was pulling his leg about Dostál being a Minister.

<ul><li> There is a story or joke about a Dutch horsebreeder conversing with an Englishman where she uses the Dutch word for breeding (fokken) and then mistakes the Englishman's "pardon" for the Dutch word for horses ("paarden"). Both <em>fokken</em> and <em>fucking</em> have the same Germanic stem in both meaning and grammar (see <em>ficken</em> in German). In some versions of the joke, it's the Prime Minister of the Netherlands on a state visit to the United States.

</li><li> Former Dutch prime-minister Joop den Uyl once remarked that "the Dutch are a nation of undertakers" when he meant to say they were entrepreneurs ("ondernemers" in Dutch). "Undertaker" <em>is</em> the literal translation of "ondernemer," as in "an undertaking."

English is an absolutely horrible language to learn due to it effectively being a hybrid Germanic-<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_influence_in_English">Romance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>-<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonicisms_in_English">Celtic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> language with weird exceptions to its own grammatical rules and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide">inconsistent pronunciation rules</a>, so it's no surprise that non-native speakers are particularly likely to make mistakes in this language, especially if their mother tongue doesn't use the Latin alphabet.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">Engrish</a> is pretty much the epitome of this trope. Many of the problems stem from the fact that, in Japan, English looks cool and interesting, so fashion designers tend to use random English words for the sake of fashion. In those cases, it's common to use curse words and other dirty phrases. Some clothing tends to be plastered with the word "fuck" and it's seen as nothing, and one infamous t-shirt had the phrase "Spread Beaver, exposing the vaginal area." One ad for Bubble Tea says "The joy of sucking on balls" (although it's entirely possible they knew full well the double meaning). In China, this is common on public buildings, though normally these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole">close translations that just have different connotations here</a>. Common ones include "flesh" in place of "meat" and "cock" instead of "chicken;" others might say things like "Carefully Fall Down," "Baby on Road," or "Don't Touch Yourself, Please Let Us Help You." A particularly bad one was during the Olympics where a Korean shop's attempt at English said "Server Translator Error." Engrish can be found all throughout Asia, South America, and even Europe.

</li><li> The infamous comments of Madam Ngo Dinh Nhu, describing the Buddhist self-immolations in South Vietnam as "barbecues," may be an example of this.

Apparently, the Hebrew word for water buffalo, <em>behema</em>, is slang for a thoughtless, rowdy person. And the sorority girls outside his dorm were being thoughtless and rowdy. So he poked his window out of his room and yelled, "Shut up, you water buffalo!" Unfortunately for him, the sorority girls in question were black and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">thought that he had called them some new racial slur</a> - an understandable mistake, given that racist shitheads are fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization">likening black people to non-human animals</a> and non-Jewish American sorority girls are unlikely to be aware of Hebrew slang. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo_incident">Thus began one of the great tempests in teapots of the 1990s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2">World War 2</a>, an American airman was captured and placed in a prison camp with other captured airmen, many of whom were British. Trying to be friendly, they kept telling him to remain hopeful and "keep his pecker up." Evidently, for a while he was confused as to which part of his anatomy they were referring to.
</li><li> The English idiom "on the &lt;vehicle&gt;" uses an atypical preposition (if this particular usage weren't so ubiquitous it would be confusing even to native English speakers ... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a> had a routine about "Let the daredevils ride <em>on</em> the plane, I'm riding <em>in</em> the plane"). When a native English speaker tries in good faith to do a word-for-word translation into any of several other languages it's fairly common for them to accidentally imply that something is <em>on top</em> of the vehicle instead of the intended meaning of <em>inside</em> it. Another source of preposition trouble is that the English preposition "on" can mean both "atop" (as in "the spoon was on the table") and "affixed to" (as in "the picture was on the wall"), where some other languages use distinct pronouns for these concepts.
<ul><li> This probably serves as a meta example. "On" in English is actually a preposition, not a pronoun. This leads to a confusing reading of the example until the mistake is realized.

<ul><li> When the Soviet Union occupied Estonia during WWII, they started a wide range of propaganda publications all over the country. As Estonian is a Finno-Ugric language, closely related to Finnish and unrelated to the Indo-European languages such as Russian<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11a9in');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11a9in" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11a9in');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Aside from Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and Basque, chances are if a language is European, it's Indo-European. The Germanic languages (such as English, German, Dutch, and Swedish), Romance languages (such as Spanish, French, Italian, and Romanian), and Celtic languages (the most common being Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh) all fall under this category.</span>, the Russians often didn't quite know what they were doing. For example, in the Estonian town of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapa,_Estonia">Tapa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, they started a newspaper called "Tapa Kommunist," which could mean "The Tapa Communist." However, "tapa" in Estonian is also the imperative form of "to kill" (as it is in Finnish — see below), meaning that Estonians, who were at the time engaged in guerilla warfare against Soviet troops, read the newspaper's title as "Kill the Communist." When the Russians became aware of this, they decided to rename the newspaper, and using an Estonian dictionary, came up with the name "Tapa Edasi," meaning "Tapa Forward." However, "edasi" in Estonian not only means forward, but also onward, making this new headline mean something along the lines of "Keep on Killing." Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">this town was not to be messed with</a>.
<ul><li> In the Soviet and post-Soviet era, this town is well-known in Estonia for its prison.
</li></ul></li><li> There are numerous examples of Estonian words which may sound funny or rude in Russian. It becomes even more hilarious due to 30% of the present-day Estonian population being Russians, and Estonians themselves tend to know at least some Russian words. Kindergarten "Mudila" ("Asshole" in Russian), for instance. A bit of an outdated example (since it no longer exists) is the Estonian University of Experimental Biology located at ebi.ee and its e-mail ebi@ebi.ee. "Ebi" in Russian is the imperative form of "to fuck" and the "@" [at] is pronounced as [собака] ([dog]). The .ee domain is spelled similarly to the Russian word for "her," which gives us an undying "fuck [her], dog, fuck her!"

<ul><li> The word "Tae" appears in many words and names in the Korean language, but in the Philippines (specifically, the dominant Tagalog local dialect), "tae" means "feces/shit." Initially, this was met by a fit of giggles among Filipinos, but ever since Korean Dramas bought more of Korean culture to the Philippines, the joke ran off its course.
</li><li> In some Tagalog dialects, "kiki" is slang for "young woman's vagina" Unfortunately it is also a Japanese name, adding new, terrible meaning to things such as <em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em>
</li><li> Conversely "puki" (pronounced pookie), is used a common English pet name, but is slang for "old woman's vagina."

<ul><li> One Canadian working abroad in France was flustered one day when she was trying to introduce a guest around her workplace, using the word "introduire" repeatedly as she made the introductions, which on the surface sounds correct. Unfortunately, the correct way to introduce someone is to "presenter" them, as in "may I present so-and-so." <em>Introduire</em> means literally "to insert." It also means to have anal sex with, in French slang.
</li><li> The French words <em>poisson</em> (fish) and <em>poison</em> (a toxic substance) are close enough to be confused. The former is pronounced with unvoiced 's' (pwa-so*) while the latter woth voiced 'z' (pwa-zo*). <em>Poisson sans boisson, cest poison!</em> (Fish without drink — it's poison!)
</li><li> The French <strong>noun</strong> <em>baiser</em> means "a kiss." However, the French <strong>verb</strong> <em>baiser</em> means "to fuck" (originally it meant "to kiss," but the euphemistic meaning gradually took over and became obscene rather than euphemistic). This has tripped up quite a few enthusiastic non-native speakers. In a quite hilarious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">Have a Gay Old Time</a>, some older books have repeatedly translated "to kiss" as <em>baiser</em> rather than the modern <em>embrasser</em>. Suddenly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> became a <strong>lot</strong> more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>-ish to French audiences...
</li><li> The French word meaning "preservative" is <em>conservateur</em>. The word <em>préservatif</em> means "condom." Hence, an old joke wherein the clueless American sees that the milk in a French supermarket is unrefrigerated and, in French, attempts to ask whether there are preservatives in said milk.
</li><li> In French, definite article + plural noun conveys the meaning "all the X," similar to English speaking about, say, "the French" or "the Jews." However, English doesn't carry these meanings over to common nouns, while French does. Hence, English speakers often seeing nothing wrong with ordering "the peas" at a restaurant, only to confuse a French waiter by ordering all the peas in the world. A more common example is to ask for "le sel" (the salt) or "le poivre" (the pepper), with similar results. (Properly, you ask for "du sel" and "du poivre.")
</li><li> Asking to use the guillotine (also known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_cutter">paper cutter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) in a French office will get you some funny looks for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">obvious reasons</a>. The correct word is <em>massicot</em> or <em>massicotier</em> after its inventor.
</li><li> <em>Plein</em> or <em>pleine</em> means <em>"full"</em> when applied to objects, so a novice French speaker who has had enough to eat might say <em>"Je suis pleine,"</em> accidentally announcing their pregnancy. However, that's a perfectly reasonable way of speaking in Québec, thanks to their relative isolation and proximity with English-speaking countries.
</li><li> Another common one is to ask for <em>une chambre</em>, which is likely to raise a concierge's eyebrows when you're not a guest: <em>chambre</em> is a <em>faux ami</em> ("false friend") for room/chamber and translates to "bedroom," <em>une salle</em> is the French for a general room.
</li><li> French dialects from different parts of the world frequently give different meanings to the same word. For example, in France, kids are usually called 'gosses', but that's a slang word for a man's jewels for someone from Québec. Thus, a phrase like "I give a kiss to my kids every night before going to bed" has a whole new meaning...

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder25');">    German </div><div class="folder" id="folder25" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> "Ich bin ein Berliner!" This famous line was spoken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> to express solidarity with the people of Berlin during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>. A common urban legend states that the real phrase should be "Ich bin Berliner," but with the indefinite article <em>ein</em> added, it became "I am a jelly donut" (<em>Berliner</em> being a type of donut originating in Berlin). The supposed error is similar to the English phrases, "I am Danish" vs. "I am a Danish." Which shows less than perfect understanding of German grammar, since in this context, the presence or absence of the indefinite article doesn't actually <em>make</em> that sort of difference. In either case, video recordings of the speech exist and the crowd clearly understands the phrase and takes it as it was meant.
<ul><li> "Ich bin ein Berliner" <em>could</em> be read as a reference to jelly donuts (but only if you wanted to deliberately misconstrue it). Saying "Ich bin Berliner" could not.
</li><li> "Ich bin Berliner" translates to "I am a Berliner." "Ich bin ein Berliner" means "I am a particular Berliner" or "I am one of many Berliners." It's also worth noting that the kind of jelly donut known as 'Berliner' in other parts of Germany is usually called 'Pfannkuchen' (literally pancake, and used in that sense elsewhere for extra confusion) in and around Berlin itself. For more detail, see <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the Other Wiki.
</li></ul></li><li> In what may be an urban legend, a cautionary tale is told to GIs learning German. A young serviceman is in a German bar trying to pick up a lovely young lady. Trying his best to impress her, he says, "Ich möchte dich heute nackt sehen." He gets a drink in his face and spends the rest of the night alone and/or humiliated. What he was trying to say was, "Ich möchte dich heute Nacht sehen," or "I would like to see you tonight." What he said was, "I would like to see you naked today." (The "ch" in "Nacht" is the guttural sound of "loch" in Scottish English and Scots.) Note that the "ch" sound in "ich" is not the same sound as in "Nacht." (German speakers distinguish the two by referring to those sounds as "ach laut" ("oh sound") for the sound that was botched here and "ich laut" ("I sound") for the one that seems to have been been pulled off at least well enough to not sound like something else).
</li><li> If a German speaker wanted to explain what crops their farmer father grew, they might say they grew 'mice' if they didn't know that Mais translates as corn (though maize would be correct, the listener was evidently not familiar with this crop).
</li><li> This regularly occurs in English classes at German schools: In German, "prägnant" means "concise/to the point." Hence the German phrase "kurz und prägnant," which legions of students have translated to "short and pregnant." Pregnant in the sense of "expecting a child" is <em>schwanger</em>.
</li><li> English speakers learning German often have trouble with the sounds spelled "ie" and "ei." In military language schools, you can count on at least one student in each class habitually confusing the verbs <em>schießen</em> (shoot) and <em>scheißen</em> (shit). Similarly, "Liebchen" is a term of endearment like "sweetheart," while "Leibchen" refers to an old-fashioned undershirt. The problem arises from the different spelling conventions of English and German: In German "ie" is always pronounced like English "ee" and "ei" like English "eye," while in English whether "ie" and "ei" are pronounced as "ee" or "eye" depends on the context (e. g. "fancied" vs. "tied" and "Keith" vs. "either" in British pronunciation), which also leads to frequent misspellings of German names and loanwords in English. For instance, it is not uncommon to see the spelling "weiner" for "wiener" — in German "Wiener" (pronounced "veener") means "Viennese," while "Weiner" (pronounced "viner") looks like "cryer," which is actually quite close to its English near-homophone, "whiner."
<ul><li> Oddly enough, while some pronounce Einstein "Einsteen," nobody ever goes with "Eensteen" — nor "Ain-steen" (as in "eight").
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1950s the British manufacturer of Coventry-Climax engines discovered the hard way that "Climax" in German has only <em>one</em> of its several English meanings...
</li><li> German school books tend to have fun with this. As an example given, an English man orders a dry martini in a bar. The bartender gives him three martinis, because "dry" (which in German is "trocken") sounds like the German number "drei" (i.e. "three").
</li><li> Southern Slavs often have fun with the German word "kurz" which means short. However, this is just one letter away (in spelling and phonetically) from the word "kurac" which means cock (and is often used the way fuck is used in English, with the same level of offensiveness). This is especially hilarious to young school goers as German is a often a mandatory subject in primary schools.
</li><li> During both world wars, when the Germans were questioning possible English and American Spies, they would often ask a series of rapid fire questions and listen for the wrong answers. The English "Who What Where When and Why" corresponds to the German words "Wer, Was, Wo, Wann, und Warum." Both sides often confuse these words, so asking quick questions and demanding quick responses, often times with the interrogator intentionally mixing the words as well. This worked for detecting German spies on the Allied side as well. A native German speaker would be more likely to answer "Where are you?" with "I am Hans" rather than the correct "I am in the room."

The translations he gives of the Japanese sentences here are completely incorrect. 'Uchi ni kaeru' would mean 'Are you going to go home?', and 'Uchi ni kuru' in this context could only mean '[Do you want to] come to [my] house?' Also, the 'misspelling' is more than just 1 syllabic ('letter'), so 'small' is minimizing the guy's misunderstandings here.

</div></li><li> Then in the comments:
<div class="indent"> I don't know who Reuters got to do their translation, but {DaHjaj 'oH Qaq jaj vaD bI'reS} means more like 'The beginning of a flexible day acts falsely honorable it today [sic].'
</div></li><li> Nerd hats on: the famous Klingon proverb 'Today is a good day to die' is {Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam}, and the word for opera is {ghe'naQ}. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">And this is pretty easy to Google.</a>

The "Unready" is a mistranslation of his sobriquet; "unrǣd" actually meant "folly," literally "no-counsel." Still presumably a pun on his name, <em>&amp;<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AElig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AElig">A Elig</a>;þelræd</em> means "well-advised."
</li><li> The various kennings, two-word poetic names for things, are frequently treated carelessly. E.g. "Beowulf," which translates to <em>bee wolf</em> meaning "bear" (not a type of wolf or anything of the kind).

<ul><li> Sports journalist Michael Green once accompanied a British rugby side on an unprecedented tour of Ceauşescu's Romania, where rugby was and remains a big sport. He recalls that a very senior man from the English Rugby Union had to respond to a speech from his Romanian counterpart, and was fretting over not knowing any of his hosts' language. Then he had a brainwave: at least he could get the words for "Ladies" and "Gentlemen" from whatever was written on the local lavatory doors. He did this, and was gratified at the smiles and the round of applause his speech got, culminating in a standing ovation. Afterwards, the president of the Romanian Rugby Federation said to him that it had been a wonderful speech, Sir Richard, but whatever in the world possessed you to begin it with "Urinals and Water Closets?"

<ul><li> Russian jokes about the Chinese frequently feature use of the syllable <em>hui</em>, which appears in both languages. In Chinese, it is used in several innocent words. In Russian, it roughly means "dick" (but is far more taboo, being part of the so-called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_(Russian_profanity)">mat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> vocabulary). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> A new Chinese ambassador is to meet Gromyko. When the latter enters, the Chinese presents himself: "Zhui Hui!" Gromyko, unperturbed, retorts "Zhui sam!" The surprised Chinese asks: "And where is Gromyko?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(The pun is that "zhui hui" (a mock Chinese name) means "chew a dick" in Russian and "zhui sam" means "chew [it] yourself").</span>
</li><li> There is at least one website for teaching Russian that has this trope's name as one of the phrases taught.
</li><li> There is an old example of machine translation well-known in Russian community where system instructions "Execute installer by tray icon and insert ms windows binaries or another os with custom mouse driver support in current boot drive" are translated into Russian as something like "Put the mounter to death by the picture of tea-tray and paste sets of two items of mistress' windows or any other mouth with customhouse support of mouse teamster in current shoe engine." What's hilarious is that the result is grammatically correct (while normally random word sequence wouldn't make any sense in Russian) and the thing is especially bizarre thanks to the mounter's execution part.
</li><li> A recently published Russian <em>"Babylonian phrase-book"</em> IS this trope. It has the weirdest of things translated into different languages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun">as its sole purpose</a>. The very idea is making them sound like you've just said something wrong. Includes masterpieces like "Can I divide by zero in your country?" "These pickles are confusing," "Do you take money as a payment?" "Let me go, I have a right to call my avocado!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12080m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12080m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12080m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In French, "avocado" and "lawyer" are the same word, "avocat."</span> and such.

Sort of.
</li><li> One comedian tells a story that he once choked in a restaurant, and began to flail his arms. He accidentally proposed to a deaf lady.
</li><li> A religion teacher for the deaf once confused the signs "to feed" and "to eat" — in telling the story of the feeding of the five thousand. This same religious teacher, in trying to sign "water," made the sign with the wrong hand, consequently signing "beer" instead. When her audience was incredulous, she dug herself deeper, trying to sign that we need water to live, that our bodies are made mostly of water, and that the oceans are filled with water (only she kept signing "beer" instead of "water").
</li><li> In British Sign Language, Australian Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language (collectively known as BANZSL), the sign for the letter Q (index finger of the dominant hand hooked onto a ring made of the thumb and index finger of the other hand) and the sign for sex (index finger through the said ring) are sadly easily confused by the uninitiated.
</li><li> The "nanny nanny boo boo" gesture that is popular with children in America (with putting the thumb on ones's nose and wagging one's fingers) means "kiss my ass" in American Sign Language. One teacher told her class about how she did not know that when she was a young ASL student working with deaf children for the first time
</li><li> It emphasises the importance of lip pattern in British Sign Language to differentiate between similarly signed words when you learn that "Where do you live?" looks identical to "Where is the toilet?"
</li><li> In Australian Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, 12 is signed double-2, while 22 is signed double-2 with the second to the right of the first (the same rules apply for 13 and 33, 14 and 44, etc.) Hence signing "my girlfriend is 22 years old" incorrectly may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPaedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPaedophile">get you in trouble with authorities</a>.

<ul><li> Spanish lesson time.
<div class="indent">"Tengo quince años." — I am fifteen years old.
</div><div class="indent">"Tengo quince anos." — I have fifteen anuses.
</div><ul><li> There's a story of a guy new to Spanish who wondered why, every time he asked a kid their age, the kid would burst out laughing and answer, "Uno" (one).
</li><li> In the 1990s, there was an ad on the back of a magazine for Amazon.com's Spanish-language site, depicting the book cover "Cien anos de soledad" (Gabriel García Márquez's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsOfSolitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsOfSolitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em>), illustrating the common Web 1.0 problem of websites that don't take accent marks seriously.
</li><li> The US government used to fund a digital ticker in Cuba that would display pro-American propaganda. The problem: the ticker had no Ñ. When the sign scrolled through the Gettysburg Address in Spanish, it made the same mistake.
</li></ul></li><li> Supposedly, when the pope visited Miami, one enterprising person printed up t-shirts. Unfortunately, instead of "I saw the Pope" (Vi al Papa), the shirts said "I saw the potato" (Vi la papa).
</li><li> The Spanish word for "pregnant" sounds a lot like "embarrassed" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13p6ku');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13p6ku" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13p6ku');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it doesn't help that the word "embarrassed" doesn't have an exact translation in Spanish</span>. One pen company supposedly ran into this problem when an advertising campaign in Mexico claimed that their pens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsbestosFreeCereal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsbestosFreeCereal">would not leak in your pocket and get you pregnant</a>.
<ul><li> Also because of how gendered adjectives work in Spanish, the word is always "embarazada." "Embarazad<em>o</em>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">will usually get you laughed at.</a>
</li><li> A lady went on a mission trip to Mexico (or somewhere). As she was wrapping up her work with the local church, they threw a dinner. At the dinner, the pastor of the Mexican church made a long speech thanking her. When it was her turn to speak, she stood up and attempted to make a statement about how excessive the thanks were. What she actually said was, "ahora el pastor me ha hizo embarazada" (translation: "Now the pastor has made me pregnant").
</li></ul></li><li> Another common false cognate is "exit," or "salida" in Spanish. Somebody saying "Estoy buscando el éxito" is looking for "success."
</li><li> A Spanish teacher in a seminary school was talking about a river that originated in the Pyrenees, when an Argentinian student began laughing loudly. The teacher blushed and revealed he had said "orinando" rather than "originario," meaning instead of saying, "The river originating from the Pyrenees," the teacher said, "The river urinating from the Pyrenees."
</li><li> A humorous example results from the mispronunciation of the phrase "Hace juego con," meaning "matches with." If read/pronounced as "Hace jugo con," it means that something makes juice with something else.
</li><li> The Spanish word for "question" also sounds a lot like "pregnant" (pregunta). At least one high school Spanish book uses this in an extended gag dialogue to illustrate the dangers of false cognates.
</li><li> There's an urban legend that Chevrolet (and their foreign counterparts) apparently came up against quite an issue when they attempted to market the Nova in Hispanic markets since "no va" means "doesn't go." In actuality, a Spanish speaker wouldn't read "Nova" as "no va," any more than an English speaker would read "notable" as "no table." Especially since "nova" is clearly related to 'nueva', meaning "new."
</li><li> The Mitsubishi Pajero which, despite its name coming from an Argentinian cat, had to have its name changed to Montero in certain countries — you see, "pajero" roughly translates to "wanker" in in certain dialects of Spanish (including Mexican Spanish, which is why the name was changed in the US as well).
</li><li> Studio Ghibli ran into trouble while marketing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleintheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleintheSky">Laputa: Castle in the Sky</a> in Spanish-speaking countries. "La puta" means "the whore" and the name was likely deliberately chosen as satire when Jonathan Swift wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em>. Not a word you want to find in the children's section, at any rate. This is why Spanish children versions of the book (those that actually bother to tell what happened after Liliput, that is) change the floating island's name to Lupata or Lámputa.
</li><li> There is a section in New Mexico which in the original Spanish is "Peña blanca" or 'White Rock'. This has been Anglicized into "Pena blanca." This one change in letter means the section is now technically named "White Sorrow."
</li><li> Gorillaz song 'El Manana', 'El Mañana' (The Tomorrow). It has no awkward Spanish meaning, however; it just sounds silly, not to mention the fact that it was done so because their keyboard had no 'ñ'.
</li><li> An Arabic Christian Orthodox bishop who had just been assigned to Chile (and his command of Spanish was still a bit lacking) gave his first sermon during his first mass in the country. He kept saying that a life of virtue would lead every man to "la <em>libertad</em> del pecado" ("freedom <em>to</em> sin") instead of "la <em>liberación</em> del pecado" ("freedom <em>from</em> sin"). While somewhat this trope, this is more a case of "idioms and prepositions vary wildly, from dialect to dialect and from language to language." In instances in which everything <em>but</em> the preposition is right, the problem is likely due to lack of knowledge of the non-native construction or simply "thinking in the wrong language" (thinking of the sentence in the native tongue and translating exactly, which happens often when speaking).
</li><li> The Filipino word for a particular type of rice cake is identical to the Spanish word for "male whore."
</li><li> Many people new to Spanish will say "con yo," rather than "conmigo," when trying to say "with me." Unfortunately, "con yo" is pronounced similarly to coño, which is Spanish for <em>cunt</em>.
</li><li> Another false cognate: 'excitado' does not translate to "excited," it means "aroused."
</li><li> "Molestar" simply means "bother," "annoy" or "harass." Unlike other examples it's <em>not</em> a false cognate though, the word used to have the same meaning in both languages but the definition narrowed down specifically to sexual harassment in English.
</li><li> Costa Rican legend tells that, when the Spanish first arrived there, they were offered "Cacagua" by the Native Americans. This is what the natives called the drink that they concocted out of cocoa beans and other spices. Unfortunately, "Caca Agua" roughly translated into Spanish as "Poop water." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> Happens often with Spanish speakers as well: the Spanish word "bizarro" and the English word "bizarre" are just one letter away and both come from the Italian word "bizarro" which means "choleric," but they have vastly different meanings. In English it means "extravagant, unusual" while in Spanish it means "brave." This doesn't stop Spanish speakers from using "bizarro" as its meaning in English while it makes no sense most of time.
</li><li> The word "bicho" gets similar treatment. The word is generally translated as "bug," which in most common usages fits perfectly, but some people think that that word is an actual scietific translation the word refers to "bug" in that sense rather than any generic arthropod, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">correct people for incorrect usage,</a> however, the word "bicho" is a actually much more vague term that can be used derogatorily to refer to any kind of animal, so refering to a spider as "bicho" is as correct as using said word to refer to an elephant or a mouse, more akin to the English "critter".
<ul><li> The fact that in some (not all) Spanish-speaking countries "bicho" is also slang for "penis" doesn't exactly help, either.

<ul><li> You might come across some <em>Bad-Termometer</em>'s making you wonder "Why is it so lousy?" The word <em>bad</em> is Swedish for "bath" — so it actually is a decent bath thermometer.
</li><li> Likewise, buying <em>mat kimchi</em> in an Oriental foodstore in Sweden produces moments of hilarity — what are the other kinds of kimchi then, fodder? <em>Mat</em> means "food" or "edible" in Swedish, while it means "cut" in Korean.

One bulletpoint was supposed to say "Never jump straight out of a window, lower yourself onto cushions." Only they got the word for cushion (gaddha) confused with another word (gadha). Which created the interesting fire safety tip of; "Never jump straight out of a window, put yourself on a donkey."

<ul><li> A platoon of American soldiers were looking for their transport to take them back to base and asked a local man where the convoy could be found. The man pointed to a hill and told them to go over the next hill where they found, instead of their convoy, an elephant grazing in a field. They went back to ask the man again and he pointed to the same hill where they'd found the elephant. Turns out that due to tonal differences, "Where is the convoy?" can be translated to "Where's the elephant?"
