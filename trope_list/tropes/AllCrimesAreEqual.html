</p><p>In fiction, if an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">empire</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">government</a> is meant to be seen as evil, any crime, no matter how minor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">is punished with the same brutal force.</a> Most often this manifests itself as a slight slip-up in the presence of a ruler, such as merely speaking a bad word or telling a joke about the emperor (or being even tangentially suspected of helping a rebel in any way, even unknowingly) has you put to death, imprisoned for life, mind-wiped, tortured, crucified or punished in a similarly excessive way.
</p><p>The problem, however, is that if merely suggesting the emperor is fallible carries the death sentence, what do you do with more severe criminals such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">arsonists?

One would almost expect petty criminals, knowing it's execution for them either way, to "go for broke" and engage in more violent crimes for the fun of it or possibly spite and/or despair. In both fiction and real life, this frequently results in a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fates Worse Than Death</a> for the <em>big</em> crimes while a pickpocket "only" gets his head cut off, which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">if you think about it</a>, sort of defeats the concept of All Crimes Are Equal in the first place and making it just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>.
</p><p>Certainly, this method of governance has a great tendency towards generating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">rebels</a>: since a minor disagreement brands you as a traitor anyway, screwing you over forever, why not die fighting the power that so unjustly attacked you?

Before the series is out, we see such things as people committing suicide by <em>graffiti</em>. Not to mention the <em><strong>purse-snatcher</strong></em> he sentences to death at one stage. He follows the logic of "kill the worst criminals, whoever they may be". As the killings caused drops in crime rates, the "worst" criminals became petty robbers and such. He was eventually planning to kill people for <em>being lazy</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Teru</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Mikami</a></span> <em>actually did this</em>, and Light's only complaint was that it was way ahead of schedule.

He also comes to believe the gods are no better since they do nothing about mortals. It's for this reason he believes the only person worth living in all realities is just himself.

Only problem is, people in F City are <em>very</em> lawful, so in order to get their suits off, they have no choice but to consider this. They get desperate enough to even go so far to set up the crime just to make sure it counts when it's dealt with. Suffice to say, their super-powered super suits often resulted in an all-out overblown special attack. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Its like being forced to swat a fly by detonating a nuclear bomb.</a>

But while nothing is ever formally acknowledged as law on New Hong Kong, there are quite a few <em>local customs</em> that the residents are very vigilant about enforcing for themselves. Often with plasma cannons.
</li><li> In point of fact, the NORMAL operation of the Lawgivers is to vanish anyone who breaks any active law. The New Hong Kong situation developed because when the planet was being settled, a programmer hacked the Lawgiver list and added the "No New Laws" rule, which everyone promptly voted into effect. The programmer has vanished because the law against interfering with the Lawgivers was already active, but none of the other laws could ever go active, causing all the Lawgivers to leave except for one observer.
<ul><li> As it says on the sign at the spaceport, ""No laws" doesn't mean "No rules"".

But he also doesn't go around beating <em>everybody</em> he sees as immoral to death. He spends his time brutally dishing out "justice" to murderers and rapists, leaving the petty thieves, whores, and the rest alone unless they specifically cross him or get in the way of his pursuit of bigger fish.

At first, he's killing murderous scum in reaction to his Mom and sister being murdered by crooks who got away with it. At the end of the series, sponsored by a new regime, he's gone around the bend. Among many things, the age at which someone can be tried as an adult is now in the single digits and pretty much everything is a crime punishable by whatever the hell he wants it to be (and brain scanners are used to cover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Thoughtcrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Thoughtcrime">bad thoughts</a>).

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a></em> story arc had a demon army summoned by an overzealous man named Albert Davis trying to keep the peace in his city. The good news: It worked. The bad news: It worked by having the demons disable all technology more complicated than fire and also teleport out of nowhere to kill anyone who broke <em>any</em> law. Theft? Death! Assault? Death! Littering? Death! Green Arrow and sidekicks have to go to hilarious lengths when they arm the town's cops and mafioso (with bows and arrows, natch) and pit them as an army against the demon summoner. They get the bows by being let into stores by the owner of those stores, leaving enough money behind to cover everything they've taken, and they don't make a single move against the summoner until the entire army has been deputized by the sheriff and they've gotten a warrant. <em>Then</em> they go to... arrest him.
</li><li> There have been several antagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> that have adopted more extreme views on Justice Dept.'s duties and practices.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Judge Death</a> and his cohorts come from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> where it was determined that since crime is only committed by the living, all life itself was made a crime punishable by death. Even before they issued that ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict">Dystopian Edict</a> the Judges of that dimension were already murdering people on the streets for any infraction imaginable.
</li><li> Mechanismo was a program for new robotic Judges implemented after severe manpower shortages. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">quickly started to malfunction</a> during live field tests, handing out Isocube sentences that exceed even the disproportionate standards of the regular Judges (25 years for littering? Judge Dredd might be an asshole, but he'll probably settle for 1 week in the cubes), and later going on murderous rampages to kill "criminals".

</li><li> The Manhunters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> also eventually decided that all life = crime and went on a genocidal rampage or three.

</li><li> Ever since the Registration Act was passed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, any unauthorized use of superpowers gets you thrown in the Negative Zone prison for life or until you agree to work for the government, whether said powers were used to start a fire or save a baby from the fire.
<ul><li> Under Norman Osborn, this has been expanded to "Doing anything that slightly annoys him or questioning his minions in any way."
</li><li> One comic from the FLIGHT Anthology has a group of anthropomorphic animals stumble upon the "Perfect Lemming City". Unfortunately, lemmings are so obedient and ordered (and also intuition-stupid; they need white lines on the ground to get to work) that any infraction equals death, nothing more and nothing less, INCLUDING A REFUSAL TO SIGN DEATH CERTIFICATES AFTER BEING FOUND GUILTY. Luckily, that intuition-stupid part about lemmings means that they just throw the group a few feet from the city and wait for them to stand there and die. Also, the jail has good sandwiches.

Any Decepticon that hinders the cause in any way meets with the same punishment: brutal execution.

The White Council justifies this by the fact that even minor dark magic perpetuates more and more dark magic use until the warlock's mind is twisted beyond recognition.
<ul><li> Though the White Council has suspended the sentence if someone is willing to speak up for the perpetrator. Both Harry and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Molly Carpenter</span> have benefited from this.
<ul><li> And they're the only ones of their respective generations. It turns out that if the person who got their sentence suspended reoffends, the <strong>sponsor</strong> also dies. This has a... discouraging effect on potential defenders of the inculpable.
</li></ul></li><li> Initially the White Council distrusted Harry because he killed his mentor with magic, which is against the First Law of Magic. In reality, it was self-defense since said mentor was planning on mind-controlling Harry (as he'd already done to his other student) and attacked with intent to kill when Harry discovered his plan and tried to escape. The White Council was more than willing to ignore these mitigating factors and kill Harry until one of the senior Council members vouched for him; after that, his sentence was commuted to the "Doom of Damocles" which amounts to probation, with a very eager and distrusting probation officer.
</li><li> As Anastasia Luccio, the Commander of the Wardens (i.e. the wizards actually charged with enforcing said death penalty among their other duties), explains to Harry in a later book, another reason in modern times is simple overpopulation: with the rapid increase in the number of humans in the world over the last century or two, more new magical talents are being <em>born</em> than the Council is equipped to carefully judge on an individual basis each time they step over the line.

</li><li> Played straight to a chilling degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em>. The book starts off with the penal planet Despayre (a play on the word "despair"). Are you a murdering psychopath? You get sent there. Are you a smuggler who was in the wrong place at the wrong time? You get sent there. Are you a normal person whose only crime is guilt by association, or someone who backed the wrong candidate in an election? You get sent there. The planet is pretty much set up to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a>. You are there for life, with no possibility for parole, and escape is very difficult at best...and impossible at worst. Only the prisoners chosen to work on the Death Star are taken off the planet, but they clearly are stuck building a giant superweapon. And it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">goes even darker from there</a>. How so? Well, once construction of the Death Star is complete, Grand Moff Tarkin decides to celebrate its completion...by testing the Death Star's superlaser on Despayre. Conan Antonio Motti tried to point out the possible political fallout of this action. Tarkin simply blew it off, because he was convinced that everyone on the planet were just condemned criminals sentenced for life, none of <em>those</em> people would ever return to civilization, and all of them were an unnecessary burden on Imperial troops and resources, not to mention many Imperial alien slaves. He also wanted to see what his biggest weapon would do when he needed to use it before going into battle. Oh, and he also says that instead of imprisoning criminals, they will just use the death penalty and that Imperial justice is about to become swift and sure.

Minor crimes like theft or fraud have minor punishments while major crimes like arson and murder can get you hung. Where this trope comes in is in the redemption for crimes. For the right cost, paid by another person, any crime can be 'redeemed' and the criminal becomes indebted to whoever paid for their crime until that person legally declares that debt repaid. The only exception is murder, in which case you are automatically marked 'permanently unredeemed' if not hung. Should you fail to repay your debt, which can require anything from paying the person back in cash to years of servitude, you will be marked 'permanently unredeemed', at which point you lose all legal rights and everyone will assume you're some sort of warped killer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Michael</span>, whose crime was basically being duped, and who refuses to spend a life in servitude, is a victim of this.

To the Garuda, all crimes are not equal, but all crimes are <em>the same crime</em>, different only in degree; taking away someone else's choice is the crime, and depending on whether that was the choice to eat the food you took, the choice to not be murdered by you, or the choice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">not to sleep with you</a>, your punishment may vary - but the crime is always considered to be the same.

Oddly this was presented as a more or less positive example that actually worked: as the Edo people proudly explain, no one has actually committed a crime in centuries due to using the death penalty as a <em>deterrent</em> for everything, which they see as inherently logical. It never occurred to them that an off-worlder unfamiliar with their laws might break one, even <em>by accident</em> - Wesley tripped and fell onto a lawn with a "do not walk on the grass" rule. Even then they aren't sadistic about it, and in fact are rather horrified that this means they'll have to execute Wesley - because none of them has ever actually had to execute anyone before. Nonetheless, they grudgingly argue that if they make an exception for Wesley, their entire legal system will fall apart and fall back into the anarchy they had before it.

Long ago, the Wraith agreed not to cull Olesia's general population as long as the Olesians keep the island sufficiently populated.

A single act that causes an outrage and a picture/video of it going viral can be enough to start an avalanche of downvotes for a person. Going above 500,000 downvotes is enough to be refused service in most places. Going above a million automatically classifies the offense as a crime against the state, resulting in an arrest. The accused then goes on an "apology tour", attending talk shows and trying to convince the public of his or her sincerity.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Myths &amp; Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most Christian sects believe that "the wages that sin pays is death" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans">Romans 6:23</a>) and that breaking one law is as bad as breaking them all (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EpistleOfJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EpistleOfJames">James 2:10</a>). This means sin lands you in destruction unless you repent. More to the point, everyone is equally guilty of sin from the moment they're born. This comes from different verses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> dealing with humanity generally falling short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) and the idea that thinking a sin is seen as equal to doing it in God's eyes, not to mention that the inaction of doing good is just as bad as doing evil. What makes sin very grievous is that it can be a way of following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>'s character, since he had rebelled against God before the world was created (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EpistlesOfJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EpistlesOfJohn">I John 3:8</a>). Applying this trope in the opposite way, this also means all sins are equally <em>forgivable</em> in the eyes of God, whether it's knowingly allowing a cashier to give you too much change or something much more serious, as long as the repentance is truly sincere.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> if one has a culturally informed understanding of ancient near east views of crime and punishment, in which case the suffering of hell is proportional to the crime, so a cashier guilty only of petty theft would face less severe punishment than a mass murderer. Similarly, the rewards in heaven are meted out the same way: those who are sincere and conscientious followers of God will enjoy a place of greater honor than those who merely pay lip service to their faith. Unfortunately, this concept of circles of Hell/Heaven is not actually mentioned in the Bible and rests firmly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Word of Dante</a> territory.
</li><li> The Quran, in comparison, explicitly says that punishment is proportional to sin, with hell split into many different levels according to severity of sins, and some punishments are only temporary. Heaven also contains multiple levels with those people who did good in life rewarded in descending orders.
</li><li> It's possible to argue that under the doctrine of original sin — the notion that "everyone is equally guilty of sin from the moment they're born" — being born is itself the sin: one is automatically damned for the crime of <em>existing</em>. In addition, since the only way out of the punishment is to actively ask for forgiveness, "redemption" for one's sin is more akin to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment">entrapment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> than anything else.
<ul><li> It's more that the crime is not being born itself, but being able to comprehend evil, and by extension, being capable of willingly committing evil acts. One interpretation of the Bible implies that children too young to understand the difference between right and wrong are (or are provisionally considered) innocent until they understand.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the Catholic interpretation, which defines original sin as simply "a lack of sanctifying grace", which is basically the key to getting into Heaven. Adam and Eve gave up their sanctifying grace, and thus they lost their kinship with God and were basically disinherited; children cannot inherit a fortune that has already been lost. Humans, as children of Adam and Eve are born without this grace much like how genes are passed on from generation to generation. Baptism is thus considered to be God giving that fortune back to humans, a vaccine if you may think of it to the congenital disease of the original sin. Even without sanctifying grace, good people were not thought to go to hell, exactly, but to Limbo, where they wait to go to Heaven. Oh, but that's another long, long trek into the Catholic Catechism than is needed for the purpose for which this page was created...
</li><li> According to Orthodox Christianity, ALL sins can be forgiven by the Lord — except you are only able to do it while alive, and the only unforgivable crime is an unrepentant sin, and suicide (as suicide is viewed as self-murder, and a person can't repent of it after that, as they have died.) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0tesl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0tesl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0tesl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not all Christian sects believe in suicide being unforgivable, though. (E.g.: "They weren't in their right mind"; "If they accepted Christ as their Savior, then <em><strong>all</strong></em> their sins — past, present, <em><strong>and</strong></em> future — were forgiven"; etc.)</span>
</li><li> Islam wholly rejects the idea of an original sin, though most people will fall into temptation in life. Yet Allah forgives. In fact "Most Merciful" is one of the many Islamic names of God.

While humiliating convicted criminals might be to some degree legitimate, applying the same treatment to people who have not been convicted — and are therefore still innocent in the eyes of the law — is highly questionable. This, combined with his policies targeting undocumented immigrants, led to his defeat by Democrat Paul Penzone in the 2016 election; Penzone promised to reverse or revise these practices, and between those opposed to Arpaio's policies on principle and those who felt that the innumerable lawsuits and massive national opprobrium the policies were generating weren't worth whatever benefit they had, there were enough voters ready to finally kick Arpaio out.

In this case, the broad and severe punishments are supposed to take the "burden" of decision-making out of the hands of teachers and administrators (particularly to protect them from getting sued). This has led to the problem of otherwise-outstanding students getting suspended or expelled for possessing such "dangerous substances" as Midol or mouthwash and such "dangerous weapons" as fingernail clippers. This leads to such ridiculous situations as middle-schoolers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense">receiving suspension for fighting back against bullies</a> who receive suspensions for the same or even lesser amounts of time. As demonstrated in <a class="urllink" href="https://notalwaysright.com/sounds-like-some-bullying-bull-to-me/179901/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysLearning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysLearning">Not Always Learning</a></em> story, particularly badly thought out rules against fights can even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">cause fights</a></em> since students know they'll be punished either way and might as well earn the punishment.
</li><li> In 1688 in England, there were 50 offences on the statute book punishable by death, but that number had almost quadrupled by 1776, and it reached 220 by the end of the century. The "Bloody Code" included some 220 crimes punishable by death, including "being in the company of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani">Gypsies</a> for one month", "strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">evidence of malice</a> in a child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">aged 714 years of age</a>", and "blacking the face or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantBurglar">using a disguise</a> whilst committing a crime". Children were commonly executed for such minor crimes as stealing. There was no real rhyme or reason to any of this — it just happened that a few MPs in 18th-century England were a bit bloody-minded, and whenever something happened that disgusted them, they said "why, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereShouldBeALaw">There Should Be a Law</a>" and promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">decided that whatever offended them at that moment deserved death</a>.
<ul><li> To cancel out the trope, only one class of executed criminals' bodies were available for dissection by medical students: those who had been convicted of murder. Apparently, going unburied was a fate <em>even worse</em> than death (in religious doctrine, being denied Christian burial was indeed a punishment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful">often used for suicides</a>).
</li><li> Another reason for so many capital crimes was that, until the 1820s, Britain didn't have a formal police force, meaning that the chances of catching a criminal were small, so the punishments for the few caught had to act as a deterrent.
</li><li> This period also gave us the sayings "in for a penny, in for a pound" and "one may as well get hanged for a sheep as a lamb". Since even crimes that had lesser punishments than death tended to have fairly disproportionate punishments, criminals, realizing that how much they stole was irrelevant to the sentence, began to shoot for larger hauls. Why bother stealing a mere penny or lamb, when one could steal a pound or a sheep and the punishment was no worse if caught? And if there were any witnesses, they might kill them, too, to escape a death sentence that would come just as easily for theft as committing murder.
<ul><li> In a similar vein, in most legal systems, the punishment for attempted murder is generally significantly lighter than that for actual murder. This is mostly to discourage people from going back to finish the job if they didn't manage to kill their guy the first time around.
</li><li> The problem actually existed even earlier: in <em>Utopia</em> (1516), one of the characters critiques the idea of the death sentence for theft over the same possible result.
</li></ul></li><li> In practice, this may have led to more crimes as well as worse crimes: many judges and juries modified the charge, ignored evidence, or outright acquitted certain offenders so as to avoid having to hang them for some of the more ridiculous statutes. Thus, it led to legal corruption and disrespect for the very law they were tasked to enforce. Ironically, because of this, the period under which the Bloody Code occurred actually had fewer executions. Moreover, death sentences were commonly commuted in more "ridiculous" cases and the offenders were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes">sent to</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Army and the Navy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder">Australia</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Nothing in the law says</a> you can't sentence someone to death and then reduce the sentence for "merciful" reasons. At times, this happened simply to empty out their prisons, as they couldn't even hang people fast enough. Of course, this was far too often simply a slower death sentence. because a huge percentage of enlisted soldiers died of diseases without ever even getting to see a battle, and the mortality rates on the ships were horrible. Lots of people died in prison from "gaol fever" as well, before ever getting hanged. Therefore, even non-capital sentences could mean death functionally.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Three Strikes</a> Laws" are statutes enacted by state governments in the United States which require the state courts to impose a life sentence on persons who have been convicted of three or more serious criminal offenses. Some defendants have been given sentences of 25 years to life in prison for such crimes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">shoplifting golf clubs</a> (Gary Ewing, previous strikes for burglary and armed robbery) or, along with a violent assault, stealing a slice of pepperoni pizza from a group of children (Jerry Dewayne Williams, previous convictions for robbery and attempted robbery, sentence later reduced to six years). Some managed to score themselves sentences of <em>50 years to life</em> for <em>stealing videotapes</em> (Leandro Andrade, previous strikes for petty theft, residential burglary, transportation of marijuana, and escape from prison<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2vd39');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2vd39" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2vd39');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He stole these videotapes in two instances, once in the burglary charge and once during his attempted escape</span>). In <em>Rummel v. Estelle</em> (1980), the Supreme Court upheld life with possible parole for third-strike felony fraud in Texas, which arose from a refusal to repay $120.75 paid for air conditioning repair that was subsequently considered unsatisfactory.
<ul><li> Some politicians, like <a class="urllink" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19940404&amp;id=0a4vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IKIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2369,2230088">Dennis Leh of Pennsylvania<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, were even proposing to enact <em>capital three strikes laws</em> for habitual violent offenders.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3rnjw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3rnjw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3rnjw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It is particularly peculiar that he said this in Pennsylvania, since <em>de facto</em> PA has no death penalty: it's very hard to get a death sentence under the PA statute. The state has only executed three people since the national death penalty moratorium was lifted in 1976, all of whom had basically given up, declining to present their case on the mandatory appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. And all occurred in the mid-'90s, under the notoriously conservative "law-and-order" governor Tom Ridge (who later went on to become the first Secretary of Homeland Security under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">Dubya</a>).</span>
<ul><li> Actually <a class="urllink" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19301116&amp;id=ZZAxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y00DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2394,5830971">applied<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Canton municipality</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">1930</a> for three-time offenders.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Athenian</a> law code of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(lawgiver)">Draco<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Much like the Bloody Code, while not <em>all</em> crimes had the same punishment, his constitution did set death as the punishment for numerous minor offenses. Unlike the Bloody Code, however, he justified his... erm... liberality with the death penalty by saying that it was the only fitting punishment he could think of for certain minor crimes, and as for worse offenses, there really isn't any worse punishment than death, is there? Bear in mind that the Greeks weren't particularly fond of torture at this point. From this, we get the term "Draconian" to describe harsh laws; the fact that his name means "dragon" is merely a poetic coincidence.
</li><li> Similar to Draco's rule, Wallachia under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Vlad the Impaler</a>. Legend has it that people were so afraid of him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">(and his punishments)</a> that one day he (purposely) left a gold cup in the street, and the next day it was still there.
</li><li> This is a common criticism of the current anti-terrorism law of Argentina, as it is completely unspecific and may be open to any interpretation. According to it, terrorism is any action that seeks to worry the population or influence actions of the government. Blow up a building? Terrorism. Kill top-level government politicians? Terrorism. Stage protests against abusive taxes? Terrorism. Conduct a study, determine that the annual inflation rate of the Argentinian Peso is over 25%, and publish it? <em>Terrorism</em>.
</li><li> The Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia considered the ownership of money, the collection of fruit by yourself, owning Western clothing, criticizing the government and sleeping on the job to be all punishable by death. Almost anything that would appear to violate the ideology of the dictator Pol Pot would send someone to prison, where 99.9% of inmates were later killed. Even Khmer Rouge cadres themselves were arrested because of how corrupt the government was and how easy it was to commit a "crime" accidentally.
</li><li> This is exactly why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">the Qin empire</a> only lasted twenty years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShiHuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a> died. The laws were extremely draconian, with the death penalty being prescribed for minor crimes for reasons similar to Draco's (to terrorize the populace). However, one of these laws created a rather perverse incentive: the penalty for tardiness in arriving at one's post in the government and military was death. One company of soldiers managed to get stuck in the swamps of the southern provinces on its way to reinforce a northern fortress against barbarian attack and realized they would not be able to report on time. It dawned on them that since the penalty for tardiness was death, and the penalty for mutiny was also death, they stood a better chance of living if they revolted (also, being killed in battle would be more honorable than summary execution). Thus they charged into a town, declared their captain Chen Sheng King of Chu (Chu being one of the nation-states conquered by the Qin),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note437in');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note437in" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note437in');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To this day, "Even Chen Sheng can be King" is a Chinese proverb meaning "even the lowliest man can achieve great power if he exerts himself".</span> and attracted an army of xenophobes and disgruntled peasants (who had also found Qin rule distastefully foreign and oppressive), beginning <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daze_Village_Uprising">a rebellion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that ultimately led to the end of the Qin Dynasty and the establishment of the pan-Chinese Han Empire.
<ul><li> The founder of the Han Dynasty, Liu Bang, had a similar story during his rise to power. Though a peasant, he had through his personal charisma made connections that ended up with him as a (low-ranking) officer in the Qin army. He was assigned to escort a number of prisoners from his province to work on Qin Shihuang's tomb. However, a number of the prisoners escaped, and guess what the punishment for letting prisoners escape was? That's right, death. So Liu decided he would desert the army since at least as a fugitive he could try to survive. He also let the rest of the prisoners go free. A number of them joined him in hiding, where they became the nucleus of the army he eventually led to win the throne.

</li><li> Parents often impress on their kids that no matter what you do you'll get in trouble if you're being bad. A common response along these lines when a single-digit-aged child steals something for the first time, no matter how cheap or minor, is to threaten to call (some actually go through with it) the police and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a>. This can backfire terribly, however, if the police actually <em>do</em> arrest and jail them. Meanwhile, at least one police force <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-32864662">actively discourages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> this practice.
</li><li> In real life, this sort of situation can occur because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">felony murder</a> rule, which provides that each and every member of a group involved in the commission of a felony if anyone dies as a result, even if accidental, is liable for first-degree murder, and thus the maximum punishment. So killing a guard during a bank robbery, or running over a pedestrian during the getaway, makes every member of the gang eligible for life in prison without parole, or (where still available) the death penalty. But it also means any additional murders are "free" since <em>they can't be punished any worse.</em> So, killing witnesses or intervening cops after someone dies, are crimes of no significance to the criminals, since they're already eligible for the maximum anyway. This is one of the reasons such laws are criticized (and have been abolished in certain jurisdictions), plus the fact that it's held to negate individual responsibility (for instance, assuming one member of a gang kills someone when it isn't part of their overall plan, or it's accidental as mentioned earlier).
