<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol">Aquarion Evol</a></em> features MIX, a prudish redhead who deems boys inferior to girls in terms of combat potential, and is opposed to inter-gender interaction even after her school turned from gender-segregated to co-ed. She, in particular, despises Andy and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">lecherous antics</a>. This is partially justified by her father's affair with a woman he met at a hole-in-the-wall bathhouse (thus also contributing to her dislike of holes, which happens to be Andy's specialty). Soon, however, she starts defrosting to her male classmates and learns to cooperate with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII">Armitage III</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> is given in snippets, but a key plot element is that feminists have become political powerhouses equivalent to Greens. It is implied by the presence of an Earth "observer" that on Earth, women have gained status equivalent to South African whites under apartheid — and few are willing to give that up just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsNeedsWomen">Mars Needs Women</a>. Space has been colonized, and Mars has been partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform">Terraformed</a> but has thus been unable to draw enough women to the planet to breed new Martians. Androids known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">Seconds</a>" were created first as a source of labor, then upgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a> as an immigration draw; come to Mars and leave the shrews behind for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">sweet, willing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">conCeption</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexbot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexbot">Sexbot</a>! The long term solution was to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>build</em> fertile women — the eponymous "Thirds"; robots so human that they can be <strong>impregnated</strong>. When the Straw Feminists find out about the plan, the threat to their power base pisses them off to no end, resulting in an ultimatum; scrap the baby machines or Mommy will come do it personally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOfEarthlyAggression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOfEarthlyAggression">along with as much of the landscape as necessary</a></span>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Used to its full extent in the Amazon Lily Arc, when Luffy was sent there by Kuma. Most of the Kuja warriors have a severe distrust of men, despite most not having even met one. Their society is SO strict that a Marine Vice-Admiral had to dock his ship 15 miles from the coast. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gets relaxed to few meters from the coast, but the point still stands.</span> Those that do help became suspected and put to be killed (though most of their fellow Kuja are actually horrified by this.) Luffy becomes put to death when he accidentally saw the leaders' mark on her back (signifying an aspect of her horrific past she and her sisters will do anything to keep secret.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luffy defeats both the giant panther sent to kill him and the two sisters before actually covering up one of their marks because he knew it meant a lot for the sisters to keep it secret. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy">Also, Luffy's completely unaffected by Hancock's charms which means he's completely unaffected by her Devil Fruit powers)</a></span>. Furthermore, Luffy proves the conviction of his choice when offered a ride off the island or the de-petrification of the subjects that helped him. He not only chooses the latter but <em>bows</em> his head while doing so, flabbergasting them. Eventually, he learns their horrific past and his kindness touched them all that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Boa Hancock actually falls for him.</span> Despite this, he is still one of the very few men allowed freely (the other being Rayleigh Silvers, who helped the Boa sisters in the past.)
<ul><li> It also mildly deconstructs the notion. A large reason for their zealous vitriol against men is out of never interacting with one. Most don't even seem to understand them as being much like fellow human beings. They try and use <em>Luffy</em>, the first male they met, as an example, which leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>, especially when they assume that all males are also made of rubber (they have no understanding of Devil Fruits and believe the Boa sisters' powers were the result of a curse.) Even those that go out on crews and see the outside world, only have a basic understanding, which is not much. The only ones that have a decent understanding of the outside world, the Boa sisters, also influenced the society because the first men they met were unfortunately the World Nobles (who are scumbags supreme). Despite this, they are civil when on the job (namely when Hancock is performing her duty as Warlord.)
</li><li> As for how they maintain their society, the actual pirates of the Kuja go out and have daughters with (presumably strong) men to bring back to the island. However, it's been implied that some may not have returned. At the very least, many Empresses have actually died from <em>lovesickness</em> (or rather, from denying their love) to a certain man. The only survivor besides Hancock was the previous Empress, who's the Boa sisters' mother figure and being the oldest, has the most experience, thus averting this.
</li></ul></li><li> Benio and the Zuka Club from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> are a troupe of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">lesbian actresses</a> (parody of the real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakarazukaRevue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakarazukaRevue">Takarazuka Revue</a>) who advocate female superiority and at one point (pictured above) perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazi salute</a> against a backdrop of a red flag with the Japanese character 女 (<em>onna</em> meaning "woman") instead of a Swastika — <em>literal</em> feminazis. Their radicalism is probably just a result of being headstrong teenagers who are just as silly as the Host Club. At the end of the episode, Haruhi, whom they'd been trying to recruit, tells them that she finds their viewpoint "interesting and unique" but doesn't feel like leaving her friends in the Host Club. In the original manga, the conflict is eventually resolved with the Host Club's apologetic invitation to one of the Zuka Club's performances, which everyone found enjoyable. This ending was replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaPeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaPeel">banana peel jokes</a> in Bones' anime adaptation.
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shitsurakuen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shitsurakuen">Shitsurakuen</a></em> is the the female protagonist has to protect girls from their male chauvinistic classmates. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was being manipulated all along by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> who hated men and believed that knights are supposed to protect girls and girls only. After discovering this, she realizes that it's wrong to only focus on helping girls, and not all boys should be considered villains just because they have to live under a misogynistic system created by a power-hungry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a></span>.

As Anaconda of the Serpent Society puts it, "What'samatter, you didn't get asked out to the prom or somethin'?" Despite this, she was able to gather enough followers to put together one of the largest all-female teams of superhumans to date (actually, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femizons">one of the largest teams of superhumans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>period</em>). Superia seems to have dropped this in her later reappearance; she has both men and women in her employ and treats both her male and female mooks like crap and now mainly focuses on her own selfish goals. This is probably because her previous schemes usually were foiled with the help of other female characters. (Many of them on the aforementioned large team, Anaconda included.)
</li><li> Man-Killer, whose name speaks for itself. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> is that she was scarred by men.

She chewed out her Muslim roommate Dust over her decision to wear a niqab, going so far as to call her an embarrassment to women everywhere.

After their reality merged with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Spear Counterpart</a> the result had both sexes living together in peace. Thundra later found another such reality, the copy of her original one where it never merged, lived there for awhile, and then came back to the present leaving there a daughter Lyra who too grew up into another Straw Feminist. However, both characters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">changed a bit</a> where they became heroes of the present and showed romantic interest in men.

</li><li> Bravura in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix">Asterix</a> and the Secret Weapon</em>, especially in the first couple of acts. She's incredibly rude to men at all times for no reason, plays 90s-style feminist folk music that the men despise, accuses critics of her aggressive and nasty behaviour of being misogynists, and dedicates her (children's) school to educating the village women about equality, apparently in the interests of gaining power. The only man she likes is Asterix because she admires his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">intelligence</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> streak compared to the other men, but she treats him entirely as a sexual object for her own amusement and refuses to acknowledge any of his feelings on the matter.

However, when her surrender is denied, even though everyone else is willing to fight, she and Asterix collude to peacefully Gallify the Romans instead (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenLoveShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenLoveShoes">through converting the village to sell designer shoes</a>) and she apologises to everyone, realising she and he are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>, and allowing Asterix to kiss her gallantly on the hand (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">with an ass shot, in case you didn't get it</a>).

She is actually supported by plenty of women (including <em>Van Der Kasseien's</em> own wife in-law) in-universe in the album, though she was eventually caught. Her views are so sexist (she thinks male either only obey other male or are making an Olympic discipline out of the attraction of women) that it's unbelievable that <em>Marcel Kiekeboe</em> and <em>Van der Kasseien</em> fit her description to a T.
</li><li> "Prime's Rib", a story exclusive to the UK version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel-published</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Transformers</a> comic, explained the female Autobot Arcee's existence as being created by the Autobots to appease a group of feminists that whined about the Transformers identifying as male even when told that Transformers technically have no gender. Even after Arcee's creation, the feminists are still not happy and proceed to complain about Arcee looking weak, being colored pink, and being the only female Transformer in existence. They especially took exception to Hot Rod stating that he's all for Transformer women after he inadvertently ended up colliding into Arcee. Simon Furman, the writer of that story was notoriously opposed to the inclusion of female Transformers.
</li><li> Parodied in <em>Lupo Alberto</em> with Alice, who, back when the comic was still a strip, was known to torment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Alcide</a> by shaking him and calling him a pig because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">he's the only actual pig around and so he can't retort</a> (at least she apologized after the fact).

Dr. Fortune's rant accuses Batman of killing the aliens because he can't feel what it's like to have something growing inside him and helping it reach its full potential. Clearly, she's talking about pregnancy, but later it's revealed she's actually talking about the inert xenomorph queen inside her that boosted her abilities and lifespan but was unable to reach the chestburster stage. She's rather pointedly proven wrong when she believes she only needs to imprint on a xenomorph to control it (as the previous ones were hybrids of Batman villains, xenomorphs and her own DNA), unfortunately, Killer Croc's hybrid didn't have any of hers and promptly dissolved her head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BratPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BratPack">Brat Pack</a></em>, Moon Maiden is a psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> expy who runs around castrating men. On the surface, she seems to be a parody of feminism, but as the miniseries goes on, it becomes clear that she's just plain nuts.

At first this seems to the modern reader to be a remarkably progressive expression on the part of the author, but reading further, it becomes clear that a contemporary reader would have found the idea to be very humorous and inherently ridiculous from the outset. As the novel progresses, it becomes clear that Miss Western is tyrannical and only feels this way because she doesn't have a man of her own.

The Scouts come off better, but they're still slightly crazy. The main difference between the Scouts and most examples on this page is that they are more or less egalitarian feminists that both know of the progress made towards gender equality in the USA during the 20th Century as well as recognize the fact that in the post-apocalyptic present all those achievements are being eroded. Furthermore, they realize that within a generation or two women could be in the same situation they were two centuries ago, or if the Holnists win far far worse. This possibility they really want to avoid. The "slightly crazy part" is that the Scouts are mostly from a pocket of civilization centered on a surviving university campus, so they're long on ideology and commitment but short on practical solutions. Although they earnestly try to train and prepare for the coming conflict, battle between the Scouts (in their current form) and the Holnists would be a lot like an armed hiking club trying to repel a Cossack raid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Perhaps unsurprisingly, their plot against the Holnists fails.</span>

He certainly doesn't object later when Lucy suggests girls need less water than boys.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some fans find the Drahvin from "Galaxy 4", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">matriarchy</a> where all but a small number of men are culled ("they have minimal function"), as being an attempt at invoking this through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a> - women were beginning to find their way into producer roles in the BBC in the 1960s (including <em>Doctor Who</em>'s first producer Verity Lambert), and many men viewed them as being terrifying, warlike man-haters, or alternatively beguilingly beautiful and stupid sex objects, both of which are traits the Drahvin display. The fact that Verity Lambert was about to step down as showrunner also adds a suggestion that this was intentional. On the bright side, the Drahvin don't display any sexism towards the Doctor or his male companion and in fact, don't seem entirely sure what men and women <em>are</em>, and the fact that they're aliens makes it a bit easier to accept.
<ul><li> The Drahvins were originally male until Verity Lambert suggested making them all-female instead. This played on the audience's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">assumption that pretty ladies were the good guys</a> when they were, in fact, common brutes.

The Doctor and Jamie are imprisoned by 'Dolly Guards' and Zoe is brainwashed, betraying the Doctor in her newfound feminism. In the end, men rise up and have a revolution, while Jamie puts Zoe back in her place by spanking her. While the episode was never produced, the Big Finish audio version includes an adaptation of the story.
</li><li> There's a particularly dreadful example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> story "The Time Monster": Dr. Ruth Ingram spends most of her time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">complaining about men just for the sake of it</a>, and being a hypocrite about it as well. It doesn't help matters a lot that even though the script is playing it as if her grievances aren't legitimate, a lot of her complaints are about things that are actually shown happening to her in the story - her boss says things like "Don't you worry your pretty little head about it" to her.
</li><li> The 1970s Sarah Jane Smith is a more sympathetic example. The fact that she's interested in women's-lib is mostly used to set up gags where she complains about being asked to do fairly reasonable things and the Doctor gives her a devastating one-liner putting her in her place, and in other scenes she displays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">sexism against other women</a> (such as a really weird 'women drivers' line in <em>K9 And Company</em>). She mellows out about it by the time the Third Doctor regenerates into the Fourth, apparently because Tom Baker felt misogynistic put-downs didn't fit his character - but unfortunately also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">loses a lot of her legitimately tough traits</a> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">Harry Sullivan can take over them instead</a>, a situation which only reverses after Harry leaves.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmperorScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmperorScientist">Emperor Scientist</a>-wannabe villain in "Robot", Hilda Winters, is of note as she is portrayed as a <em>literal</em> "Femi<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">nazi</a>". Other than this, she's a more nuanced example in that her feminism actually allows her to come off better than Sarah Jane in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyThatsMyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyThatsMyAssistant">Actually, That's My Assistant</a> scene.

</li><li> The episode "Night Five" features an intern with Straw Feminist tendencies who takes umbrage at a joke Sam makes towards Ainsley Hayes which sends him into a defensive frenzy all episode, and who eventually gets torn a new one by Ainsley herself by the end.

</li><li> One of the episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> mocks this trope. The patient is the personal assistant of a woman whose mission in life is to "enforce" gender equality in workplaces. When House finds out what she does, he tells his team to apologize for him raping her. "You know, metaphorically, by having a penis." She's seen in the cold open entering a board room full of men and snidely asking them why they didn't even "pretend to put a female on the board" and saying that there were plenty of secretaries and stenos downstairs.

At the end of the episode, she leads a pointless protest<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19u1e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19u1e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19u1e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A sit-in at a men's club, with Sam pointing out that they jumped right to protesting without even trying normal methods first</span> and tries to shoot the sheriff, who gets saved by Sam. Afterward Al reports that the feminist gets out of jail in five years and becomes a well-respected women's rights advocate (apparently having mellowed out and considered Sam's words in the meantime).

<ul><li> Subverted where Donna Pinciotti is very passionate in her feminist beliefs yet she remains a very likable character.
</li><li> Played straighter, and for laughs, with her mother Midge. She gets caught up in second-wave feminism and tries to prove to her husband that women are just as capable as men... but unfortunately, Midge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">an idiot</a>, so it doesn't really work. When a feminist group comes over to her house, they discuss how the title of "mailman" is sexist. Bob tries to point out the absurdity of it by asking why it's called "mail" in the first place, instead of "femail," and Midge agrees with him. She then tells another woman that "I saved you a seat on the ottoman. Oops! I mean the otto-woman."
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, Dr. Anna DelAmico was inexplicably determined to interpret EVERY SINGLE THING a male co-worker said or did as sexist and patronizing and/or a come-on. When he called her by her first name rather than "Dr.", she ranted and raved at him for several minutes and all but accused him of hitting on her and/or trying to undermine her in front of her patients, and continued to do this even after he apologized and assured her that he meant nothing improper and often called the male doctors by their first names too. Later, when he offered her help with patients or advice on how to deal with them, she blasted him for being condescending. At no time did it ever occur to her that she was overreacting. What's worse, upon complaining to a coworker, the other woman also played this trope straight, automatically assuming that the man was in the wrong and that his supposed sexist treatment was because he had been unable to get her into bed-without <em>ever</em> hearing the man's side of the story.

Anya has dedicated over a thousand years to punishing men. She starts realizing some men are good after falling in love with Xander. It takes her a long time to start feeling guilty. Willow's mom is a shrink built on theory who doesn't pay any attention to her kid, and once ranted about the patriarchal content of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">the Mr. Rogers show</a>. When Willow came out to her as gay, she thought it was a political statement. Because creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> is a feminist himself, these straw feminists are in a different context than others. The initial introduction of 'vengeance demons' implied that they were all, like Anya, devoted exclusively to punishing men for wronging women. Later episodes introduced more diversity while establishing that this approach was largely born from Anya's own personal issues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">something of an inversion</a> with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Straw Misogynist</a>", a demon named Billy whose physical touch (or blood/sweat) could incite active women-hating feelings within men. This was utilized to have the women address their issues of feeling powerless around men and a couple of male characters had to work out the possibility they had such feelings towards women to start with. Angel ended up being immune to Billy's powers not because he was a vampire but because he has had 200+ years to work out such general issues towards women.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus">Big Wolf on Campus</a></em> episode, "The Pleasantville Strangler". Stacy attends a feminist rally in honor of "Abigal B. Abbernacky", who was the town's first feminist. Tommy attends the rally as well (mostly as an excuse to cozy up to Stacy). Midway through, Stacy is possessed by the ghost of the titular strangler and begins to wrestle Tommy to the ground, causing the rally leader to shout "Show the man who has the power!" and one of the girls to exclaim "I didn't know this was going to be an anti-men thing!" Before all of this goes down, the girls all seem to just be calling for equal pay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal">Ally McBeal</a></em> played with this trope a fair bit — many of the cases the team handled were accusations of sexual discrimination of some kind, and had an opposing lawyer, plaintiff or witness with a straw feminist argument to back it up. Ally (or, more frequently, her colleagues) would counter with a far more reasoned response along the lines of 'normal' feminist views, based on equal treatment for men and women alike.

Initially, it was described as positive — there were no wars, there were (supposedly) no class differences, except men were considered the inferior sex, suffering the same injustices faced by women of the forties and fifties like sexual harassment in their jobs (if they have any time off from house care), and not suitable for anything remarkable such as becoming a leading political or religious figure (even the Pope was female). Arturo becomes a somewhat unwilling figurehead for a men's rights movement in an election for becoming a Mayor.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> played this out. Theo offers to plan a bachelor party for Denise's husband Martin. When he offers to get Martin a stripper, Martin tells him "no". Well, this apparently isn't good enough for Denise, who, egged on by her sister Sondra, starts screaming at Martin for not being offended and disgusted at the idea of having a stripper. The scenario degenerates into a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsVSBoysPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsVSBoysPlot">battle of the sexes</a>", with the women denouncing everything the men say or do as sexist and patronizing, while the men actually make several valid points about the women overreacting and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">blatant double standards</a>.

The most notable instance is when graduate student Shazza Zulu, in his debut appearance, publishes a book that calls men out for their misogyny, and nearly every woman at Hillman laps it up like it's water. This leads to the men and the women "boycotting" each other for the entire episode. The notable part comes in from the fact that it was introduced by a <em>man</em>.

</li><li> The episode "The Power Of Madonna" has Quinn (who ironically embodied the WORST stereotype of woman in the first 13 episodes, what with her use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">The Baby Trap</a>) AND Finn (who says 'It's easy to be a dude' before the guys perform 'What It Feels Like For A Girl'.

</li><li> Played with and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> with the character of Dana Foster (Staci Keanan) on the 1990s sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep">Step by Step</a></em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Smart Blonde</a>, Dana was proudly feminist and was not afraid to say so.

One episode had her signing herself and her sisters up for a self-defense class, and they all take to the training quite well. Another, though, has Dana absurdly claiming that women can do <em>anything</em> men can do — even if they lack the physical strength for it — and getting called out for this by her sisters. Overall, Dana was one of the more competent and likable characters on the show in spite of her flaws, and got some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> by lightening up in the later seasons and getting a boyfriend who was healthily macho — and, remarkably, all this without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">running afoul</a> of the usual pitfalls.

<ul><li> Penny Halliwell claims that men are "utensils" that can be disposed of when they're finished. This attitude probably comes from the fact that she was married four times (and engaged twice more) and she even states that something must have gone wrong when the Chosen Child is a boy. It was vaguely implied at the end of the episode that she was possibly under some kind of spell from a former lover who was now a Necromancer and was trying to manipulate her to become human again. She had always been a strong-willed feminist, but even her granddaughters thought her "she should have gotten a dog, they're more loyal and die sooner" line was uncharacteristically extreme, even for her. In the end, she said she had "been so blind", whether by her own bitterness or some type of magic is left up to the viewer.

Interestingly, Britta got some praise as a character because she's a long list of the reasons Feminism exists in the first place: She defines herself almost entirely in how attractive she is to men, fights with other women over being attractive to men, and blames other women for problems in her life, especially those indirectly caused by men.
</li><li> Rare male example with Georg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Naeturvaktin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Naeturvaktin">Naeturvaktin</a></em>, who passionately insists he is a radical feminist despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">no idea what radical feminism is</a>. He insists the progenitor of feminism was not Mary Wollstonecraft but Karl Marx, and displays obvious misogyny towards women, which, when called upon, he argues is because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex">there are women, and there are hags</a>".

One of the more common (and possibly unintentional) examples would be her chastising a guy (usually Slater) for calling women "foxes" or "chicks" by calling him a "pig." One episode plays with the trope where it involves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyContest">Beauty Contest</a>. Jessie initially protests the pageant but when Mr. Belding allows boys to enter it as well, she drops the protest and enters herself (now viewing it as fair that both genders are involved).

While it's established that the place has good reason to exist, the three members we see most of are Athena, who wants to shut herself and her fellows away from any contact with men whatsoever; Artemis, who wants to declare war on all men; and Demeter, who hopes that in vitro fertilisation and chromosome mapping will eventually eradicate men altogether.

A woman who works at a women's health clinic is a potential juror called in the Avedon trial, who's counseled rape victims in the past. The defense is afraid she might be biased given their client is charged with the rape and murder of a woman he was sleeping with, thinking she's a feminist who will thus have some hostile views of him. Their jury consultant points out things she might feel which are in their favor though, showing they shouldn't assume this just on the basis of her (inferred) feminism.
</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> comes across this trope many times like, for example, from the episode "White Men Can't Kiss". In the episode, DJ refuses to kiss a girl in the school play just because she's black. Later in the episode, Roseanne is visited by the girl's dad at The Lunchbox and acts callous towards him. He assumes she's being racist towards him but admits that she's prejudiced towards all men equally. He then calls her out saying that her sexism isn't as different and her son's racism. In the episode "Wait Till Your Father Gets Home" it's revealed that her hatred of men comes from her being abused by her dad.

But even as early as the first episode, she's called out by religious conservative Karolina for not respecting women who don't subscribe to her exact views, and over time the two form an unlikely bond.

Steed appears to have missed the point that Woman's Liberation involves a battle for equal rights and opportunities, not "hating men". In fairness, the feminist movement would have been a lot more radical in the early '80s when he wrote it.

They keep slaves of other races, and men of their own race are virtual slaves unless they manage to become powerful mages or swordsmen (the only two positions in drow society they're allowed to take, aside from basic laborers and craftsmen). A male drow who harms a particularly skilled slave is likely to be put to death under the idea that a drow matriarch can always find another male easily, but a good slave is hard to come by.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em> features "Margaret", an all-female space station that edges this trope, especially with some of its members experimenting with genetic engineering to make males unnecessary for reproduction. It's pointed out in the books that in a solar system where people can and do change sex temporarily for fairly trivial reasons, and the big civil rights debates involve artificial intelligence and biological androids, the Margaretians are still fighting the last century's battles. They aren't depicted as wildly stupid, just stubbornly out of date. They <em>are</em> respected for their women's self-defense classes, which produce some of the most formidable human martial artists in the solar system.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>, the all-female Black Furies fit this trope to some extent. While some are into the spirituality of womanhood and/or seek gender equality and reproductive freedom, others are on a sacred quest to castrate every male they come across. But even the more well-rounded Furies have the Tribal Weakness of an easier time frenzying against men due to pent-up frustration against them. They eventually became more well-rounded with later editions, going from man-hating Amazons to a mystical cult of warrior women that worshiped Gaia in her guise of Artemis and provided the Garou Nation with necessary prophecy. <br/><br/>In <em>Apocalypse</em>, the guidebook that dealt with the end of the world for <em>W:tA</em>, there's a chapter that discusses the possibility that the Apocalypse may begin when another entire tribe of the Garou falls to the Wyrm. The suggested scenario for the corruption and fall of the Black Furies involves all of them changing into the most stereotypical possible version of the tribe, out to cull the human race by murdering most of the men.
</li><li> A more concrete example comes with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>. The Circle of the Crone is a covenant that is rather feminist in its leanings, but not to the point of straw — except for one faction within the covenant, the Daughters of the Goddess, who claim that their ritual in which they sacrifice a male vampire, ritualistically called the Oak King, is evidence for their valuing (and not hating) men. This is the only ritual where male vampires are allowed any sort of prominence, and they may only be the Oak King. Needless to say, the other covenants, and indeed most other factions within the Circle, ain't buyin' it.

The male protagonist tries to get along with her, in a way that would work with even the most extremist feminists, but he does not succeed, as Lily doesn't believe in the humanity of men and is only confused when he tells her he read her porny sci-fi series for the sci-fi. All of it. Without masturbating. She is an interesting case in that she has the same low opinion on men's self control that misogynists usually have, (she doesn't want to be alone in a room with a man - sounds familiar, doesn't it?) but has a different solution to the problem: In her sci-fi series there are no men, as the artificial reproduction that is necessary due to some infertilizing disease only works with female fetuses.

Oddly, most of her support staff is male, although in complete agreement with her.

</li><li> <em>Moon Over June</em> is a pornographic webcomic about two lesbian roommates. Summer, the elder of the two, hardly goes a strip without reminding the reader just how very feminist she is, mostly by her utter scorn for anything with a Y-chromosome. For a while, she wouldn't even use a penis-shaped sex toy because it reminded her too much of a man. She got over this by rationalizing that it's the perfect expression of female sexuality to completely separate the phallus - the only worthwhile part - from the man it's attached to.

<ul><li> Numbuh 86/Fanny came off like this in her first few appearances, where she would blame any problems on the boys and refused to share credit with them. Later episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">revised her characterization</a> to be less sexist and more just generally unfriendly.
</li><li> Madam Margaret is an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">extreme</a></em> version of this trope. She's the ruler of a dystopian future where girls hunt boys and turn them into girls with 'girlifying ray guns', and gets the ball rolling by sending her past self said ray guns. Her stated goal is to create a world without boys and practically accomplished that before an old Numbuh 4 (aided by Numbuh 3's <em>granddaughter</em> Sally, ironically) used her time machine to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">undo her schemes</a>. The creepy part is that she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <em>kid</em> in the present. Her entire motivation for wanting guys gone is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">she doesn't get along with her brothers</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>: Kitty is heavily implied to be one of these in "The Mask", with the main difference between her and a normal example of this trope being the fact that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">hates dogs</a> (which are often stereotyped as being masculine while cats are often stereotyped as being feminine) rather than hating actual men. Luckily, however, Courage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">re-uniting her with Bunny</a> at the end of "The Mask" causes her to finally realize the error of her ways and remove her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">incredibly creepy-looking costume</a>.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> titled "Girls' Night Out" has resident ghost baddies Kitty, Ember, and Spectra plot to make every male disappear permanently. Spectra, however, is the only one who fits the trope, going as far to make "wo-manicotti" on a cooking show, the other two aren't against men. However, this <em>does</em> raise questions what happened to Betrand, her assistant/ possibly husband...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> had Ms. Janet Barch, oddly enough for a girl-positive program. Is the type <em>that</em> broad? It's apparently got something to do with a previous husband; she often goes on rants about wasting "twenty-two thankless years" with him, and at times will start screaming at other men as if they were actually him. She eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">mellows out</a> a bit... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitbullDatesPuppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitbullDatesPuppy">at least with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieTeacher">Mr. O'Neill</a>. The example can count as a deconstruction of the trope since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Barch served as a way of showing how ridiculously unrealistic the straw feminist character really is when compared to realistic feminist examples like Daria and Helen Morgendorffer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In an episode where Peter is forced into sensitivity training, he was so trained that he himself did a feminism equivalent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and became an extremely fluffy combination of this and a cookie-baking, bridge-playing young biddy that blames all the ills on men. He ends up falling in with one-shot Straw Feminist character Gloria Ironbox, who implies that Lois' choice to be a wife and stay-at-home mother is the reason Peter doesn't respect women and that her children are screwed. And what does Lois do? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">After shutting down her arguments,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">she beats the shit out of her.</a> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catfight">catfight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">manages to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">return Peter to normal.</a>
</li><li> Peter once accuses Lois of being a feminist and calls it adorable.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with Lily from the unaired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FatherOfThePride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FatherOfThePride">Father of the Pride</a></em> episode "The Siegfried and Roy Fantasy Experience Movie", who simply wants to teach women to be independent, gets along well with Kate's husband Larry when she meets him and is deeply disturbed by Foo Lin's misandrist statements. The unfinished episode available in storyboard form on the DVD also has her attempt to help Kate's father Sarmoti grow out of his dated sexist ways.
</li><li> The Greeñorita Eco-Feminist Collective from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, especially Frida Waterfall.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> revolves around a rogue Amazon developing a plague that will wipe out every creature on Earth with a Y chromosome. It's eventually revealed that she's actually a regular human girl raised by the Amazons after being driven from her homeland by a military coup, which sparked her intense hatred of men. Ironically, much to her shock, it was actually a man who rescued her and brought her to Themyscria, which was concealed from her by her fellow Amazons (who "didn't consider it important"), although her hatred of men ultimately proves too ingrained for her to change her ways. The incident ultimately taught her fellow Amazons (who, including Wonder Woman, had displayed tendencies towards Straw Feminism themselves up to this point) to not too soundly preach the inferiorities of men and their own superiority since, as Hawkgirl notes at one point, the villain was just taking their pre-existing isolationist and supremacist tendencies to their logical extreme. This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when Wonder Woman wonders if men are <em>that</em> necessary and Hawkgirl tells her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/JusticeLeague">"don't knock it 'till you've tried it, Princess!".</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> An odd example with "The Powder Puff Boys". The antagonist is a PTA leader who proudly announces she gave up a high-paying job to spend time with her kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">In spite of this, she's shown to care far more about PTA meetings than her family</a>. Naturally, she denounces powder puff football as sexist and attempts to get the school's game shut down. Peggy even catches on to this (this being the same woman who did not realize that Redcorn and Nancy were having an affair until someone told her) openly states in a meeting she realizes she is only doing this because the woman misses her high-paying job.
</li><li> Another episode had a feminist group loving Peggy's poem about a turtle. They thought it was a metaphor for women's struggles and kept cheering her on and at the same time made Hank (who was there to support Peggy) feel very uncomfortable. It was a metaphor, but only for what Peggy was going through personally, and it had nothing to do with feminism. When Peggy added on an ending where the turtle ends up with a male turtle, the feminists gave her some awkward applause, feeling a bit cheated.
<div class="indent"><strong>Audience Member:</strong> <em>(to another audience member)</em> Oh, man, kinda copped out at the end there, didn't she?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Hank:</strong> <em>(to a third audience member)</em> Now that gal can write music!
</div><div class="indent"><em>(Third audience member walks away disgusted)</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> there with the feminist (played by real-life feminist singer Ani DiFranco) encouraging Peggy to just play her heart out, she just wanted Peggy to find her voice.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MASK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MASK">M.A.S.K.</a></em> occasionally portrayed V.E.N.O.M.'s sole female member Vanessa Warfield this way. It is most notable in the episode "Race Against Time" (where she calls M.A.S.K. member Brad Turner a "male swine") and in the tie-in comics by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> (where she makes several misandrist remarks about men being weak and easy to beat).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>, the episode "Equal Fights" had a villain named Femme Fatale, a man-hating criminal who only stole Susan B. Anthony coins and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">liked to use the fact that she's a woman as an excuse to avoid punishment</a>. She tried to convince the girls to stop helping men but her flawed logic is countered at the end by the more mainstream equality-based feminism of Sara Bellum and Miss Keane who teach the girls the difference between feminism and misandry. Not helping Femme Fatale's case was the fact that women were also hurt by her actions and that she <em>didn't even know who Susan B. Anthony was</em>, or that said woman fought for the equality of <strong>both</strong> women and men alike (leading to a very good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Shut Up, Hannibal!</a> moment by the girls). Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a>, herself a staunch feminist, later decided that the subject of feminism was too heavy for such a lighthearted family show and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">regretted writing it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: The female inhabitants of planet Gazorpazorp are these, in <em>sharp</em> contrast to the ultra-violent males that dwell on the outer surface of the planet. Naturally, they assume that <em>all</em> male species are like this.
</li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>: Phil and Lil's Mom, Betty DeVille, may appear like a bad "manly feminist" stereotype at first (which went over the head of some viewers, who misinterpreted her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>), but she's never portrayed negatively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rare male example: in one episode Marge is shown to have gone out with one of her college teachers. He is very much a Straw feminist, not liking LIGHTHOUSES because "anything penis shaped is bad."
</li><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E4SheUsedToBeMyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS16E4SheUsedToBeMyGirl">She Used to Be My Girl</a>", Homer and Marge go to a feminist convention because they think Lisa is there. One scoffs "How typically male!" at a news report about an erupting volcano. When they learn that Lisa is at the volcano, Homer says to Marge "I'll go, you stay here" and gets booed. When he says "Okay, you go and I'll stay", he gets <em>more</em> boos, and finally asks "What do women want?!"
</li><li> Then there's the episode "Bart Star" where Flanders coaches a kids' football team. Lisa arrives for tryouts not because she wants to play, but just because she wants to show up everyone for thinking a girl can't play football. Flanders immediately deflates her pretensions by showing that there are already four girls on the team; Lisa runs off crying.
</li><li> A later episode involves Springfield Elementary being segregated by gender due to controversial comments made by Principal Skinner. However, the class by the new principal is actually just a thinly-veiled lecture on female empowerment so much so that even Lisa gets sick of it quickly and defects to the boy's school.
</li><li> "Lisa Vs. Malibu Stacy" has Lisa discovering that the Malibu Stacy doll's new talking feature has nothing but stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> lines, shattering her personal perception of Stacy as a brainy activist. As a result, she goes on the total warpath (including trying to release her own doll following her perceptions, "Lisa Lionheart", which the doll's creator even explicitly notes is a multi-thousand-dollar waste when only one girl buys it and Lisa tries to call it a victory), and when Bart points out that she's exaggerating, she goes on an angry rant about how this doll will brainwash the girls of America into becoming brain-dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>-types when they grow up that nearly knocks Bart off his feet.
</li><li> In the mockumentary episode "Behind The Laughter", the Simpsons are shown at Thanksgiving dinner, having all brought their own attorneys with them on account of how they had all fallen out. Lisa's lawyer accuses Marge of assault when she snarks at Lisa about her tell-all book. The lawyer is described by a text overlay as "Shrill Feminist Lawyer".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wendy Testaburger can sometimes be this, depending on how Parker and Stone portray her in an episode (combined or not with her already being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie">Soap Box Sadie</a>). This trope also can apply to portrayals of the other female characters, though Wendy is usually the only one you see mentioned as one by certain fans not fond of the character. But when she's not a Straw Feminist? She's portrayed too "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses">sickeningly weak and girly</a>" for fans. But then there's that episode where she beats Cartman... And the other one where she <em>outdoes</em> Cartman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by launching her (lesbian) substitute teacher <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">into the sun</a></strong> because she thinks Miss Ellen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">trying to steal Stan's affections</a></span>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3glqv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3glqv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3glqv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Though this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>.</span> <br/><br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in the episode "The Hobbit", to the extent she becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> of the episode. Wendy is frustrated by one of her fellow cheerleaders being dumped on for her looks and chastises Butters for dumping on her looks while liking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>. However, when she tries to explain the dangers of Photoshop and on the body image, Butters think it's how she honestly looks like (despite doing the editing process in front of him for him to see.) This escalates as the other girls begin doing so and causes a cycle of egos to spiral out of control, much to Wendy's frustration. The entire thing goes so out of control and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">getting a talk from Kanye West</a>, Wendy tearfully resigns to conformity as she edits her own picture.
</li><li> One of the few (if only) male examples with PC Principal, with "PC People" being a rather odd euphemism for radical feminists. The reason for him being male is because PC Principal is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereotypeFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereotypeFlip">Stereotype Flip</a>; he's a character constantly shouting Straw Feminist rhetoric and ideals, but is every stereotype for a fraternity dudebro. Besides humor, the bizarre mix of character types is clearly meant to show how arrogant bullies can possess any viewpoint. However, he has now mellowed out a bit and become one of the only sane men of the show (though that's less about him and more on how everyone else has gone mad.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> had a one-time villainess who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">brainwashes all the women in the world</a> (including Wonder Woman and Jayna of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins">Wonder Twins</a>) to turn against males.
</li><li> Ariel, the villain of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> episode "W.O.W." (and the only villain in the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">motivated by bigotry</a>, it seems) is the current leader of the Sisterhood, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> that sought to eliminate all men and inferior females (women who were not the "chosen ones") gain their place as the true rulers of the world. It seemed that none of them knew the most obvious flaw in such an act (how to avoid humanity's extinction if such a plan succeeded) but ironically, Sam is a descendent of the original group.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> when a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">the Scooby Gang</a> shows up in the episode "Viva Los Muertos!" Parody-Velma (a Valerie Solanas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> named Val) is constantly spouting this talk, going so far as to actually tell Parody-Daphne that men are "walking abortions".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YinYangYo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YinYangYo">Yin Yang Yo!</a></em> has Saranoia, who is an unstable misandrist sorceress. She sees herself in Yin and tries to get her to join her while trying to kill Yang. Saranoia's problems come from being forced to study by her father while her brother Mark got to do what he wanted. To the point where she occasionally calls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianSlip">Yang Mark and once called Master Yo dad.</a> Yin thinks she's just crazy and eventually got her a restraining order on her. Despite this, she appears to still like men enough to have a male gnome servant (albeit one she mistreats) and was once seen on a date with a banker (though he calls for the check when he witnesses her doing an outburst when the rabbits suspect her of kidnapping Master Yo.) Naturally, she blames Yang.
