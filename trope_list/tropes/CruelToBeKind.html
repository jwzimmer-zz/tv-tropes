<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"Good medicine sometimes tastes bitter."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Chinese Proverb</strong>
</div></div><p>A situation where something sounds, appears, or feels like it is absolutely horrible or evil is actually an act of kindness. Essentially, it is a misunderstood action by the characters, who believe the action is being performed for nefarious purposes, while it is actually being performed to assist.
</p><p>It could be a seemingly evil character kidnapping somebody to actually protect them or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery">trained doctor viciously stabbing somebody in the chest to relieve a collapsed lung</a>. Another variation is if the character is running a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrictedRescueOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrictedRescueOperation">Restricted Rescue Operation</a> and needs to keep it a secret. The root of this trope is the act is perceived, and only perceived, as cruel or evil. This is what distinguishes it from related tropes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>, because the act is not actually evil, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StabTheScorpion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StabTheScorpion">Stab the Scorpion</a>, because the act is not discovered to be kind until much later.

Said actions also have a significant chance of backfiring, particularly if the beneficiary fails to understand their purpose, which is often a consequence of the benefactor refusing to provide an explanation. There are also some cases in which the actions simply do more harm than good.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, during Eren's trial, Levi proceeds to brutally beat him as a demonstration that Eren could be controlled. Levi beats up Eren so badly that even those who had previously called for Eren's execution or dissection looked uncomfortable and felt Levi was going too far. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was all an act to <em>protect</em> Eren, proving that if he doesn't turn into the titan after being assaulted, he isn't a threat. Commander Erwin uses this to convince the judge to let Eren join the Survey Corps and utilize his Titan abilities to help humanity reclaim Wall Maria. Eren recognizes this and doesn't hold a grudge against Levi for doing what he did.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>: Discussed when Mashiro is talking to Takagi about an editor's story that left an impression on him. He tells of a young artist who had sent his drafts to the editor, who proceeded to take a look and dump everything into a paper shredder — much to Takagi's astonishment, as he notes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the editor would probably be sued if he tried that</a>. This only drove the artist to work harder on his art and, when he got serialized, the editor invited him to dinner and apologized for the earlier treatment, while the artist tearfully thanked him for forcing him to strive harder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Byakuya and Renji make it clear they're willing to kill Ichigo to reclaim Rukia and restore her lost powers, Rukia turns her back on Ichigo after he's defeated and badly wounded, deliberately abandoning him and ordering him to never come after her because she knows her coldness is the only way to save him.
</li><li> After Aizen kidnaps Orihime, Ichigo does this to Tatsuki by saying that his spiritual activities did not concern her and telling her, Keigo and Mizuiro to no longer associate with him. Urahara later mentions it was very naïve of Ichigo to think coldness could stop his friends from caring about him or the situation Orihime (who happens to be Tatsuki's best friend) was in, since the three of them had secretly followed Ichigo to Urahara's shop and watched him enter the portal into Hueco Mundo.
</li><li> When Isshin and Ryuuken debate which of them is the worst father, there's a strong indication that they've both been forced into this trope for the sake of protecting and preparing their sons. The reasons, especially in Ryuuken's case, have only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">partially been explained</a>.
</li><li> Matsumoto thinks this is Gin's most endearing attribute. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After the battle with Aizen, in which Gin is killed in a failed attempt to kill Aizen in revenge for what he did to her, Gin left nothing behind for her to use as a keepsake. She believes he understood that a keepsake would make her linger in the past and was therefore helping her to move on by leaving nothing behind.</span>

He is a "sweeper" -a mix of private eye and hitman- and it is dangerous to become acquainted with him due to his profession. So that whenever a client is getting too attached to him, Ryo becomes -more- insensitive, rude or lecherous in order to drive her away:
<ul><li> In one story a client was considering giving up her dreams for Ryo... so Ryo pretended that he only wanted to have sex with her because <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangareader.net/636-31910-101/city-hunter/chapter-37.html">he doesn't believe he can make a honest woman happy.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Ryo had spent an arc protecting an old friend of his: a weaponsmith that wanted to quit her job for her daughter's sake. However she was considering to go back on her decision in order to remain with Ryo. So he made her believe that, should she stay in his apartment, he and his friends would force her to constantly fix their weapons. Disgusted, she decided leaving (<a class="urllink" href="http://mangafox.me/manga/city_hunter/v24/c125/16.html">although she eventually understood and accepted that Ryo was trying to do<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, when Kako has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> over the fact that he'll die at the end of his battle and begins running away, Kirie tells Kako that he "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">sure (is) a fast runner</a>" so that Kako will be able to fight- unfortunately, it ends up causing Kako to fly into a rage and beat up Kirie until Chizu stabs Kako in the neck and takes his spot as a pilot. Moji later points out that someone had to say something to Kako to break him out of his funk, or else they would have lost and their world would have been destroyed. Of course, Kirie's words wouldn't necessarily have helped Kako, since Kako would have died either way, even if Chizu hadn't killed him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, when Hajime Hinata tries looking into Natsume's murder, suspecting that it's being swept under the rug, he gets caught by Juzo Sakakura, who assaults him and gives him a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> saying he's only good for the money he provides to the school. After Hajime leaves, Juzo admits to Chisa Yukizome that he did this intentionally to prevent Hajime from looking into the school too deeply and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">getting himself killed</a>. Unfortunately this backfired as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it further drove Hajime to participate in the Kamukura project <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">in the hopes of finally becoming special</a>, which turned him into Izuru Kamukura, one of the main instigators of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the Tragedy</a></span>.

The reason for this was that his manager had plastic surgery to make her nose smaller, not knowing that he preferred her the way she was (and murdering him as a result) and that his rudeness was a means of coping with it. Though the anime version omits the reasoning for him being rude to his band, with said reason being that he was going to leave them and didn't want them to miss him.

While he forces alchemists that attempt human transmutation to pay a toll (such as Ed's arm or Alphonse's body), it wants to teach them a lesson; mainly that alchemy isn't everything and to become better people as a result. Best exemplified when he confronts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Father</a>- he sounds dissapointed as he drags him to his well deserved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> for his actions. Meanwhile, when Ed sacrifices his door of Truth (the source of his alchemic powers) to recover his brother's body, saying that he doesn't need alchemy when he has people, Truth praises him for his decision and states that he is the first one to defeat Truth; showing that in the end it wants to teach a lesson to those that commited human transmutation, not cause suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a></span>.

<ul><li> Shota Aizawa takes this approach to his students, not hesitating to expel them if he feels they aren't up to hero work. As far as he's concerned, it's kinder to just send them home than to let them waste time and effort on something they aren't capable of achieving.
</li><li> At the very start of the series, All Might tries to discourage Midoriya from pursuing his dream of becoming a hero, saying that it would be impossible for a boy without a Quirk, and saying that there are other ways Midoriya can help others. When Midoriya risks his life to save Bakugo from the Sludge Villain and inspires All Might to act, however, All Might changes his mind and decides to entrust Midoriya with his Quirk.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the teachers can sometimes act like this, and it's justified given the rather unpleasant nature of the profession for which the students are training.
<ul><li> Kakashi sets up a bell test that only two people can (theoretically) graduate from, which would split up a three-person genin team for certain, and when the would-be genin fail he threatens to starve one of them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To pass the test, the remaining two are supposed to feed the starving would-be genin, and then stand up to Kakashi when he starts screaming at them in mock anger for it. This teaches the genin that there are some things in life that are more important than the rules, a lesson they would not have learned in school.</span>
</li><li> When the three rookie teams' jonin teachers nominate their teams for the Chunin Exam, Iruka protests that it's too soon to enter them into the exam. Kakashi, however, notes that Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke are no longer Iruka's students, but Kakashi's subordinates, and he believes the test will be a reality check for them. Of course, the test ends up being much more dangerous than Kakashi could have anticipated.
</li><li> Also, Ibiki's test is another example of this. He sets up a Chunin Exam in which you have to answer ten questions, but if you <em>or even one of your teammates</em> gets caught cheating 5 times, <em>your entire team fails</em>. The questions are brutally hard, as well, and when Ibiki threatens to give one last question, he gives you the option of either backing out and thus keeping a chance to retake the exam next year, or answering the question, possibly failing, <em>and never again be able to advance in rank!</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out there is no last question, it's just meant to test the students' resolve. Which is also cruel to be kind, because if students don't learn how to sacrifice absolutely everything for the sake of the mission, or go on a dangerous mission without knowing what's in store for them if they students put their own futures ahead of the well-being of their teams or their villages, then they are useless as the hired hands and protectors that ninjas are meant to be.</span>
</li><li> Similar to Ibiki, Izumo and Kotetsu act as preliminary gatekeepers to the exam, bluntly telling the students to go home while applying a basic genjutsu to make it look like they're just outside the exam room. The goal is to weed out the hopeless cases and prevent them from getting badly injured or killed in the exam.

Gendo only came clean about this when SEELE raided the NERV Geofront in order to shut it down and Shinji was already in too deep into the fate of the world to turn back.</span> Of course, this only made everything worse.

</li><li> In Robin's backstory, she's subjected to this twice. After she passes her test and becomes a scholar, she asks to study the Poneglyphs like her mother, since that had been her reason for studying so hard. Clover, however, points out that studying the Poneglyphs is a serious crime, and threatens to ban Robin from the library if she continues further, so that she won't endanger herself. When the World Government attacks the island, Robin's mother initially denies that Robin is her daughter in the hopes that Robin will be able to get away without being branded the daughter of a criminal. Unfortunately, the attempt fails, but she is able to say goodbye to her daughter before dying with the rest of the island.
</li><li> Brook's pirate crew attempted to do this to Laboon in the backstory, sailing off without saying goodbye so that Laboon wouldn't follow them into the extremely dangerous Grand Line. Once they crossed into the Grand Line, they discovered Laboon had followed them anyway, so after spending some time there, they left Laboon with a somewhat kinder goodbye, and a promise to see him again.

However, they tell him that they do that because if the animals grow a bond, separating them later on becomes even more difficult, so it's best to do it before one can be established. Tamako also headlocks a baby calf to force feed it, because it's unfamiliar with a bottle, and will starve if it's not trained to suckle one. They also warn him not to bond with animals too closely, as they are often butchered after a short while, such as the piglets.

Later, Kaneki realises that Ayato has been trying to protect Touka the whole time by hurting her just enough to keep her out of the real fight. It is implied that Ayato was angry at her for attending school because he thought Touka was putting herself in unnecessary danger by getting close to humans, and the reason he left Anteiku to join Aogiri was because he wanted to become stronger, believing he wouldn't be able to protect her if he was weak.

<ul><li> In a chapter set in 2016 Asuka tells Shinji harshly that both Rei and Kaworu made their own choices so he must stop blaming himself for everything.
</li><li> Asuka criticizes Shinji constantly because she thinks he will never become assertive otherwise. Misato admits that her female ward has a point.
<div class="indent"><strong>Asuka</strong>: I thought Shinji was your best friend. <br/><strong>Misato</strong>: Shinji's a doormat. <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: Isn't that my line? <br/><strong>Misato</strong>: He is! He's helpful and earnest and very nice, but he wouldn't know assertiveness if it walked up and bit him. And it's so frustrating! He stands up to you all the time, I see it, but with everyone else he's a passive little mouse. <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: That's true. He doesn't like it when I yell at him, and he's learned that being assertive around me means I'll be nicer to him. But the rest of you are too polite to criticize him, so he doesn't feel the need to change. Typical Japanese. <br/><strong>Misato</strong>: How delightfully racist of you. <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: It's true. You only ever called him out when it came to his piloting; apart from that you let him do whatever he wanted, which was usually nothing at all. What did you expect?

Kaoru may have been right...he told me that this had all happened before. <br/><strong>Asuka</strong>: <em>[giving in]</em> What... what are you saying? Shinji... I... I thought... <br/><strong>Shinji</strong>: What if it's my fault, Asuka? What if everything is happening because of me? Because of Unit-01?

I just wanted us to be... <br/><strong>Shinji</strong>: For the last week, the only thing on my mind is trying to figure out how to get you back. How to make you fight back. Like you taught me to.

<ul><li> Dumbledore's actions include giving Harry to the Dursleys (to be kind, since the Dursleys <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have magical wards around their house that protect Harry from Voldemort</span>), not making Harry a Prefect (to be kind, since Harry gets so much positive and negative attention already that Dumbledore didn't want to add to his burden), and generally avoiding Harry during his fifth year (to be kind, since if Harry asked Dumbledore too many questions he might <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find out about the prophecy in the Ministry, tip Voldemort off about it through his mental connection, and give Voldemort an opportunity to lure Harry into a trap...<em>which is exactly what happens</em> when Harry does find out about the prophecy</span>).

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Granted, the flashback seems to paint George's severed ear as something of an accident and not an overenthusiastic cover act.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, Snape counts as a "meta-example" of this trope in which the <em>author</em> was cruel to be kind. At one point during an interview, J. K. Rowling was asked why Dumbledore even allows Snape to be a teacher of children if Snape isn't going to enforce the rules fairly and if Snape is going to behave like a jerk. Rowling responded that that was exactly <em>why</em> Dumbledore let Snape stay on: because Dumbledore wanted every child to learn at some point that not every authority figure can be trusted, and they'll have to figure out a way to deal with that eventually. All of the other teachers are relatively nice and are more than fair in their judgments; if there wasn't at least <em>one teacher</em> like Snape, children might grow up mindlessly trusting authority figures their whole lives because of only "good teacher" examples to draw their frame of reference from.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> McGonagall has a moment of this in the very first Harry Potter book. She catches Harry, Neville, Hermione, and Draco out of bed after hours and takes away <em>one hundred and fifty points</em>, and from <em>her own house</em> at that! (She also takes twenty points from Draco, though, since he too had to be out of bed after-hours in order to even know what the other three were doing; there was no other way he could then have informed the professor about their rule-breaking.) Her reaction is justified when you consider: one, during this particular school year there was a lethal monster in the school in addition to Voldemort being after the stone, and ultimately McGonagall doesn't want the students to consider wandering around after-hours to be acceptable. Two, part of the reasons the Slytherins all come off as such jerks is because Snape plays favorites and never takes any points away from a Slytherin student, no matter how awful. McGonagall's willingness to cost her own house the House Cup, by contrast, teaches the Gryffindor students that ethical behavior is determined by the choices you make, and not the groups to which you belong. Three, the students were willing to break rules was <em>in part</em> because Snape only ever punished Harry for breaking rules out of a personal vendetta, so the students understandably came to the conclusion that the rules couldn't be trusted. The fact that McGonagall had a legitimate reason to punish them <em>and</em> the fact that she punished Draco along with them (something Snape would never have done) drove home for the students the fact that just because one teacher is a jerk, doesn't mean they <em>all</em> are.

This means taking some extreme actions sometimes. However, the best example is probably the way he treats Officer Reed, an undercover cop trying to expose the prison drug addicts. After uncovering the truth about him, Zack tricks him into taking drugs himself and then blackmailing him so that he keeps taking them and enduring the humiliation the rest of the gang inflicts in him, essentially turning him into a junkie himself. He then reveals that this was simply his way of showing the officer how hard life is for addicts behind bars. Officer Reed then helps him to stage a coup and cut off the gang's drug supply, causing all the gang's members, including Officer Reed himself, to co cold turkey and curing them all. The officer realises that Zack's method of reducing the use of drugs in prison was more successful than his own and starts to appreciate him more.

If you show you're willing to let them kill the hostage if they're too badly hurt, you've gained an advantage, as hostage taking is a business, where there is only one buyer for each product.
</li><li> He also mentions in another episode that sometimes, what is safest isn't the most comfortable, like when a parent twists their child's arm pulling them out of a busy street. This was when he put his (tied-up) client in the trunk of his car to prevent him from being seen and/or shot in the ensuing car chase.

</li><li> Some of the solutions to the problem-of-the-week in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> are this, although given the light-hearted tone of the show, it doesn't happen too often.
<ul><li> In episodes 1 and 2, "Friendship is Magic", Celestia apparently blows off Twilight Sparkle's concerns and makes Twilight Sparkle go get some friends instead... but if Celestia hadn't "blown her off", Twilight Sparkle wouldn't actually have been able to <em>beat</em> Nightmare Moon because to use the Elements necessary to do that, <em>you need friends.</em>
</li><li> Fluttershy does this more often than you'd think. In "Dragonshy", she makes a dragon stop ruining Ponyville with smoke by yelling at him until he cries. In "Stare Master", she makes a cockatrice stop turning ponies into stone by threatening to tell its mother on it.
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle gives Spike a nasty speech in "Owl's Well That Ends Well", but it's because she was disappointed in him and thought he was better than this. Spike unfortunately didn't see it that way.
</li><li> In "The Cutie Pox", Apple Bloom gets a disease that causes multiple cutie marks to appear and forces her to act out all those talents. To get Apple Bloom back to normal, Zecora makes Apple Bloom tell the truth about having committed a theft in front of everyone in Ponyville... which is kind, ultimately, because in-context it's literally the only way to restore Apple Bloom back to normal.
</li><li> "The Mysterious Mare Do Well" episode was this. Rainbow Dash was bragging about her heroics, and then graduated to actually putting ponies in danger just so she could save them and earn more praise. It was rather cruel of Dash's friends to dress up as another superhero and upstage Dash, but it's ultimately kinder than letting Dash potentially get somepony <em>killed</em>, and be in much worse trouble than simply being made to look like a fool.
</li><li> "The Last Roundup". It was rather cruel of Applejack's friends to follow her all the way to Dodge Junction and then repeatedly pester her until she breaks and tells them the truth about why she left Ponyville...and her reason for leaving turns out to <em>not be justified</em>, so it was ultimately kinder not to allow Applejack to keep thinking her friends would stop loving her.
</li><li> "Ponyville Confidential". Yes, the entire town shunned the Cutie Mark Crusaders after they found out who Gabby Gums was... but the <em>ultimate</em> result is that after the CMC apologize for spreading gossip, Diamond Tiara, the instigator of the mess, is punished for her part in the events of the episode. And it's kinder to let the CMC know how wrong it is now, before they screw up later in life. This can be considered moot however, when Rarity's confrontation with Sweetie Belle ends up being the punch they need to decide to stop the gossip column as, while she was just as mad at the fillies as the rest of Ponyville and had a right to call her out on saying mean things about her, she was being very reasonable. Also, while this did not happen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">treating three fillies like criminals could very well haunt them forever, even if they did something really bad.</a>
</li><li> Subverted during the season 2 finale, where Twilight spends several times accusing Cadance (who is to become her brother's wife) of being an impostor because her personality was uncharacteristic of the babysitter she knew as a baby foal. Not only does this cause her friends frustration at her actions, even Celestia becomes disappointed in her when her last accusation sends Cadance to tears, prompting her own brother, Shining Armor, to tell her off for hurting Cadance's feelings. Now this would have seemed like it was all in Twilight's head, that the people you know will not always remain the way you want them and that a harsh scolding from her brother was needed to bring her out of it. Except Twilight is absolutely correct! The Cadance she was suspicious off actually was a Changeling impostor who imprisoned the real Cadance under the caves and took her form so she could feed on Shining Armor's love and use the wedding to distract them from being taken over by her Changeling minions. So in a way, Twilight actually carries the trope as while making outlandish claims against someone can make you seem mean, the fact that particular person is up to no good and could very well ruin the lives of those you care about is even more mean than simple accusations.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The Aesop</a> of episode "It Ain't Easy Being Breezies". After an accident where a group of migrating Breezies are separated from the rest of the group, Fluttershy takes them in. When she tries to get them to leave, they show no interest in leaving. Finally, after saving one of them from a swarm of angry bees with more aggressive words, Fluttershy finally decides to kick the remaining Breezies out of her home to ensure that they get back to their own home. Fluttershy learns that being kind doesn't always mean doing whatever someone else wants; it means pushing them to be the best they can be. This trope is also inverted in the same episode with Seabreeze (the Breezie she saves) learning that while good leaders are tough on their followers when needed, being too tough only causes dysfunction and hurt feelings, leading him to enlist Fluttershy in helping him learn to be more gentle with his fellow Breezies. Ultimately the lesson is "There's a time for tough love and a time for tenderness. True kindness is knowing which is which."
</li><li> "Tanks for the Memories" also covers this one. Rainbow Dash spends most of the episode in denial that Tank (her pet tortoise) needs to hibernate for the winter and trying to find ways to keep him around. Finally, Fluttershy bluntly confronts her over it and tells her that she <em>can't</em> keep him around. Rainbow Dash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering">breaks down in tears</a>, but it's ultimately what helps her work through the issue rather than trying to avoid it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> episode "The Sidekick", after Tails nearly dies in a plane crash during a battle with Eggman, Sonic fires him from his sidekick role in an effort to protect Tails from further harm.

Shiro later tells Pidge that it was a ruse so that Matt (who was chosen to fight in the Galra gladiator arena) would be safe and in the labor camps, and Shiro gets to fight opponents in Matt's place.

</div></li><li> Most modern medical procedures fall under this category, including (but not limited to) amputations, invasive surgeries, and organ removal. They all would sound quite barbaric to someone unfamiliar with the procedure, but are being done to save lives.
<ul><li> Similarly, veterinarian procedures are very likely to be interpreted as an attack by the animal.
</li></ul></li><li> Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable">CPR: Clean, Pretty, Reliable</a>, actual CPR is an emergency procedure <em>for a reason</em>. Part of the reason we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable">CPR: Clean, Pretty, Reliable</a> is because in live action media, demonstrating correct CPR techniques for the sake of showing what is correct and avoiding aforementioned trope could actually seriously harm the actor it was being done on. Among other things, the pressure of well-done chest compressions are enough to not only restart the heartbeat, but it can break the person's sternum, the rescue breathing can be enough to cause vomiting, and the combination usually causes a lot of pain for the resuscitated person later. The person doing CPR is most likely well aware of the potential consequences, but performs the procedure anyway because it can save that person's life, but only if it is done in combination with calling for qualified medical aid. CPR alone only guarantees a 2% chance of survival.
</li><li> The whole point of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> trope: killing someone (quickly and with a minimum of pain) rather than letting them die painfully or suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.
</li><li> The idea of sailors not learning to swim sounds incredibly stupid and impractical in modern times, but in the age of sail, someone who could swim a little but couldn't be saved would drown slowly, while someone who could not swim at all would drown quickly. Since nobody was actually <em>forbidden</em> to learn to swim, this was more being cruel to be kind to yourself.
</li><li> In terms of romantic relations, there are those who maintain that it is kinder to dump a romantic partner quickly and efficiently, rather than drag out the pain, if the breakup is a done deal. They hold that the pain is worse in the short term, but fades more quickly compared to false hope and dragged out melodrama. Not everyone agrees.
<ul><li> There the ancient proverbs to the effect that "The cut of a sharp knife hurts worst and heals quickest."
</li></ul></li><li> On the extremely mild end of the scale of cruelty, the "pull the Band-Aid off fast" school is all about being cruel to be kind. Though modern research has shown this to be wrong: Removing adhesives slowly hurts less both immediately and overall.
</li><li> One of the hardest things a parent, coach or teacher sometimes has to do is the opposite of helping a student/child overcome self-doubt. Sometimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">one has to puncture a dream, shatter a hope, because the circumstances are such that it's just not going to happen and pursuing it can even be harmful</a>. It's agonizingly hard to be sure when such kind cruelty is necessary, and very painful to inflict it. An example would be an offspring or student who is <em>pretty good</em> at baseball, say, and dreams of playing Major League Baseball. The trouble is that he's just not <em>that</em> good, he's not pro material and the parent or coach knows it, and knows his dream could keep him from pursuing a more realistic and achievable goal. How to tell him without being more cruel than need be? (And of course how to be sure you're right that he really doesn't have what it takes!) Similarly, a couple can be head-over-heels in <em>love</em> (or at least infatuation) and totally wrong and unsuited for each other, and all their relatives and friends know it. How to tell them or at least get them to <strong>think</strong> about it before they jump into something?
<ul><li> Some people, after asking and explaining and doing everything they can to tell them, just leave them to crash into the heartbreak. Usually, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyWayTheyWillLearn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyWayTheyWillLearn">The Only Way They Will Learn</a>.
<ul><li> This goes triple for acting. Any actual actor believes the absolute worst thing to do to someone is tell them they have a chance to make it big if you don't think they do. Best case, they get motivated enough to prove you wrong, and develop the chops needed to succeed (rage against the person trying to crush your dream can be a pretty powerful motivator). Second best case is they listen to you, and drop the dream before it puts them on the streets (in that case they wouldn't have made it anyway, and you did them a huge favor) And if they do still try and fail, they will at least usually give up with enough of their life ahead of them and avoid losing everything chasing that dream, as it's a very expensive one to chase.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Anyone who has owned a pet and they get too old, sick, or hurt to continue living a life without pain and suffering goes through this. Considering a number of pets live anywhere from 5-15 years, that is a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> of emotional investment you've put into them, and they into you in many cases. Sometimes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">putting them down</a>" is better.
</li><li> The other half of the proverb at the beginning of the page: "And the truth hurts."
</li><li> This also applies to those who care for animals who will eventually be released back into the wild. The animal's caretakers will act as cold and uncaring towards it as possible so that when it is eventually released it will live off on its own rather than seeking out humans for food and comfort, possibly endangering them as well as itself.
</li><li> This is the idea behind excommunication as described in the Bible. If a brother or sister in Christ is being unrepentant in sin, then they're supposed to be placed outside of the Church and not to have any contact with other Christians. This in turn, hopefully, will turn them away from their self-destructive path and bring them back to Christ. It's considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> because of how harsh a method it is.
</li><li> Interventions sometimes invoke the trope, especially with drugs and alcohol; the person being intervened has a serious problem and sometimes it takes a close knit of friends or family to come together and show the person that their actions are affecting not only themselves, but others that are close to them. The cold and harsh truth coming from people they know can break a person emotionally and it's sometimes what is needed to get the person to acknowledge that they have a problem and have to do something about it.
</li><li> There is a Gaelic proverb saying "A cat in mittens won't catch mice" which means that being careful and polite won't always be the most effective method.
</li><li> This is the principle of <a class="urllink" href="https://hbr.org/2014/03/hire-slow-fire-fast">Hire Slow, Fire Fast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note293d4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note293d4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note293d4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which may be a misnomer; some commenters propose that it should be called "Selective hire, quick and clean fire."</span>, discussed in the link by Harvard Business Review. If an employee isn't a good fit for the company early on in the job, it's best to fire them and let them seek a job that suits them better, instead of wasting time and money trying to help fit them into the position.
</li><li> Organizations should boot people who aren't going to cut it early. Kick them out during Basic Training, or the first semester of medical school, or fire them as soon as you see they aren't going to make it on the job. Fail quickly. Get them out there to do something else with their life, and fill their slot with another applicant. That's best for the applicant, who is miserable, possibly wasting money, and likely to fail anyway. That's best for the organization, as it allows someone else to give it (whatever it is) a shot.
<ul><li> One notorious example is Hell Week in SEAL training. Cut the people who won't make it as soon as possible, so they won't get hurt, won't hold up the team, won't waste taxpayer's money, and won't occupy a slot someone else might have.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill sergeants</a> could be considered a version of this: the reason the act so mean is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">prepare the new recruits for the incredibly stressful and terrifying world they are about to enter</a>. After all, an enemy during a battle obviously won't just patiently wait for the private to assemble his rifle before attacking.
