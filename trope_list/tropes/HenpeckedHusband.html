There are two possibilities if the Henpecked Husband actually succeeds in standing up to his wife: Either she'll hold her ground, provoking him to divorce her and revel in the newfound freedom, or his wife will not only back down but instantly swoon and throw herself at him  she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmazonsWantHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmazonsWantHercules">secretly yearning for him to grow a spine all along</a>.

</li><li> Japanese manga later turned into (a short-lived) anime <em>Dame Oyaji</em> (1970) takes this to the next level, by having the wife <em>and</em> kids beat the snot out of the dad solely because they hate him. For those who don't know Japanese, the title translates to "Useless Dad".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>: Nobita's father, Nobisuke, is more submissive compared to his short-tempered wife, Tamako, who can be bossy with him as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku is a zigzagged example. Even though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> wife Chi-Chi usually seems completely in control of him when he really <em>wants</em> to defy her wishes (which is usually for <em>world-saving business</em>) he proves to be entirely capable of ignoring her. Normally, his easygoing personality just makes him happy to defer to Chi-Chi's more forceful nature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> gives another angle to their relationship. When Goku wants to go off and train with Whis (for no particular reason other than that he wants to), Chi-Chi is infuriated that he would spend so much time away from his family and does her best to stop him. He basically ignores her and goes anyway, at which point she simply smiles and says it was unavoidable, suggesting her behavior isn't necessarily an effort to absolutely control Goku so much as to temper his enthusiasm with some degree of familial responsibility.
</li><li> Krillin also qualifies, it's just that unlike Goku, it's more downplayed. He's shown to be very submissive to his wife, Android 18, but that seems to be half this trope and half him being a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">Amazon Chaser</a> who enjoys getting bossed around by her.
</li><li> As of <em>Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta</em> has become one to Bulma, paralleling Goku's relationship with Chi-Chi. Though he is more prone to ignoring her, he is <em>terrified</em> of actually offending her, and will concede to her wishes when push comes to shove. <em>Super</em> even has him note that Saiyan men <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">have a thing for strong-willed women</a>; Bulma may not be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">she</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyMom">plenty of pluck</a>.

Nagasumi's father is also a bit of a wuss compared to his wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em> has Shiragami Genjirou, a 4-meter tall vampire with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes">Monochromatic Eyes</a>, a scary aura, a scary voice, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">Badass Beard</a>. His wife Touko is a sweet and loving human housewife, who protected his secret when they were at school and gently attends to his every need. Incidentally, she occasionally threatens him with a stake, a katana, or a crowbar when he fools around a bit too much (notably when he tries to drag their daughter Youko back home or tries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">to get between her and Asahi</a>), and he's utterly <em>terrified</em> of pissing her off.

The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS6E11LrrreconcilableNdndifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS6E11LrrreconcilableNdndifferences">Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</a>" is where the tripe on Lrrr is most blatantly shown, as that episode flanderized Ndnd into a shrew who goes as far as hitting him over the head with a frying pan and kicking him out of the house, all because he screwed up in an invasion and instead brought her a mask replica of J.J Abrams's face as a gift.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> we have Oberon, Lord of the Fae. He is often seen being either manipulated or "requested" by his wife, Titania. A line of dialogue explains it nicely.
<div class="indent"><strong>Titania:</strong> You have nothing to fear from him. On Avalon, Oberon's word is law. <br/><strong>Princess Catherine:</strong> Does that mean he's always right? <br/><strong>Titania:</strong> Not while he's married.

<ul><li> The episode "King Klong vs. the Masked Marvel" has an obese battleaxe in the sports arena audience who volunteers her milquetoast husband Herbert into fighting the Masked Marvel.
<div class="indent"><strong>Wife:</strong> Herbert, I need a new fur coat.

</div></li><li> It nearly happens to Mr. Peevly in "Bridal Boo Boo". The bears send his name into a singles club and a similarly obese battleaxe named Bertha shows up. She henpecks Peevly, Botch, and all the other zoo animals as well, going so far as to make Hair Bear keep his afro combed straight and neat.

</li><li> Used several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The early Daffy Duck cartoon <em>The Henpecked Duck</em> did this with a wife, complete with him being the one forced to sit on the egg being hatched. ("Yesth, m'love!")
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HisBitterHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HisBitterHalf">His Bitter Half</a></em>, Daffy gets married to a rich widow who turns out to be this, doing things like beating him for coming home drunk. She also has a bratty son whose bad behaviour she's either oblivious to or ignores.

</li><li> At the end of the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> short <em>Hold the Lion, Please</em>, after Bugs makes fun of a Lion named Leo whose wife calls him up and orders him home, aborting their chase, a Mrs. Bugs Bunny suddenly shows up and demonstrates that she's the one who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">wears the pants</a> in the family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LifeWithFeathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LifeWithFeathers">Life with Feathers</a></em> involves a lovebird who's so fed up with his domineering wife that he attempts to commit suicide by having Sylvester the Cat eat him.
</li><li> Foghorn Leghorn is literally henpecked in a one-shot short where his wife demands he sit on the nest and watch the egg while she's off enjoying herself. He calls her "Dream Boat" to her face, but quickly changes it to "Tug Boat" behind her back. By the end of the cartoon, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">beaten him unconscious</a>.
</li><li> The first Pepe LePew short, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OdorableKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OdorableKitty">Odorable Kitty</a></em>, has Pepe turn out to be one of these... and we learn that he's actually an American skunk named Henry!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkysRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkysRomance">Porkys Romance</a></em>, the first appearance of "Petunia Pig" in a Warner short, ran on this trope. Porky buys a box of chocolates to propose to Petunia and is thwarted by Petunia's annoying little dog repeatedly, as well as Petunia, who seems only interested in wanting to eat the chocolates. Porky, heartbroken, attempts suicide (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">aren't old cartoons grand?</a>), but ends up hitting his head and imagines marrying Petunia and a sexy honeymoon period. After a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Time Munches On!</a>" title card, Petunia and her dog are shown stretched out on the couch, fat as houses, and happily gorging themselves on seemingly infinite boxes of chocolates strewn all about the house while Porky slaves away in the kitchen doing all the cooking and cleaning and caring for the children while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">Petunia bosses him around</a>. One really does have to wonder how the writers of this one viewed marriage, and if they knew that chocolate is lethal to dogs. Porky gets better. Waking from the nightmare, he runs away, returning only to take back his chocolates and give the dog a deserving kick in the rear!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHoleIdea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHoleIdea">The Hole Idea</a></em>, the inventor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortableHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortableHole">Portable Hole</a> is one of these.

Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> pops up with his wife in tow from the very bowels of Hell, and moans "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth">Isn't it bad enough down here without her?!</a>"
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissSpidersSunnyPatchFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissSpidersSunnyPatchFriends">Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends</a></em>, Spiderus is a would-be antagonist, but any of his darker impulses are generally kept well in check by his sweetie-bug, Spindella, who clearly has him well under her eight legs. Later in the series, he also becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>:
<ul><li> A rather unfunny version with Clay and Bloberta, the latter of whom practically forced him to be his wife after being emotionally abused by her mother. The sad thing is they were actually hitting it off when they first met, with Clay a devoutly religious man. However, she had to introduce him to alcohol and it went downhill from there till both were stuck in a loveless marriage with two kids.
</li><li> Bloberta's father Raymond was also shown to be this, with her mother being overbearing towards her as well. Raymond was implied to actually be sympathetic and helpful towards Bloberta but was too much this trope to be able to.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>, there is a recurring character, a meek man who is always shown being berated by his wife, usually for forgetting a key component of a new business venture (like buying a rabbit farm but no rabbits). To complete the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, the missing component falls out of the sky, usually due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Doofenshmirtz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalSuperhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalSuperhero">Perry's</a> antics. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">Normally landing on top of the wife, to her husband's amusement.</a>
</li><li> Jerry from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> is this to a T. He and his wife, Beth, married after she became pregnant with their daughter when they were in high school. The question of if they were together by choice or not is often raised. This isn't helped by the fact that he has to deal with his wife's desire to keep her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> father in her life who constantly throws their family in danger, especially their children, and constantly insults Jerry, believing he isn't worthy of his daughter and Beth's domineering personality. In an episode where they are in a couples' therapy, it is shown that Beth's perception of Jerry is that of a spineless meek worm. He and Beth are shown to have a rather malicious, codependent relationship. No one in the family respects Jerry. He even lampshades this in an episode.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> I'm just this entire family's toilet paper.
</div></li><li> Ed Bighead is constantly bossed around by his wife Bev in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>. She is the only person (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">toad</a>) that he fears. His hot-headed personality makes it hard to feel too sorry for him. The fact that she's much nicer than him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">most of the time</a>) doesn't help either.
</li><li> Howard DeVille from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> is the submissive one of the family, though it's worth pointing out that his wife Betty isn't abusive or commanding, just boisterous, and she actively encourages him to stick up for himself.
</li><li> The Scotsman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> is absolutely lorded over by his even bigger and more violent wife. And if the giant smile is any indication, he loves every minute of it.
</li><li> Shaggy's father, Colton, is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>. He's quiet and timid in response to his wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer Simpson sometimes slips into this, but since he's by far the most extreme example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>, it's hard to imagine how the family could possibly function otherwise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais">Ricky Gervais</a> played one in the <em>Simpsons</em> episode he guest-starred in and wrote, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E15HomerSimpsonThisIsYourWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E15HomerSimpsonThisIsYourWife">Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife</a>". His character Charles Heathbar is married to a domineering woman named Verity, and then when Charles gets paired with Marge on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WifeSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WifeSwap">Wife Swap</a></em>-esque show, he falls in love with her, but eventually gets over it and separates from his wife.
</li><li> There's another humorous version in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors">Two Bad Neighbors</a>", where former President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a> (the first one) and his wife Barbara move to Springfield and buy a house across the street from the Simpsons. When Bush spanks Bart for shredding his memoirs, he provokes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar">Escalating War</a> between himself and Bart and Homer, which culminates in Bush and Homer having a fistfight in front of Bush's house just as former Russian Premier Mikhail Gorbachev has stopped by to give a housewarming present. Fed up with the whole conflict, Barbara orders her husband to apologize to Homer.
<div class="indent"><strong>George:</strong> But Bar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">we can't show any weakness in front of the Russians</a>! <br/><strong>Barbara:</strong> <em>[glaring at him with her arms crossed]</em> <strong>GEORGE...</strong> <br/><strong>George:</strong> <em>[grumbling under his breath]</em> Yes, dear. <br/><em>[Gorbachev smiles evilly and says something in Russian to his aide]</em>
</div></li><li> Invoked in a later episode with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, whose marriage to Hillary has been joked as being this trope ever since he left office and she began her own political career:
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill:</strong> <em>[calling Hillary on the phone after placing a lawn sign for her campaign]</em> Alright, honey, that's the last one. What's next? <br/>[...] <br/><strong>Bill:</strong> Twenty-five more?! What the hell did I do to you?! <br/><em>[Indistinct yelling from the phone]</em> <br/><strong>Bill:</strong> Oh you're never gonna let <em>that</em> go, are you?
</div></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios">Famous Studios</a></em> cartoon "Sudden Fried Chicken" dealt with Herman the mouse saving his friend Henry the rooster from his abusive, domineering wife, who constantly beats him and tells him how worthless he is, when Herman sees how well he takes her beatings and enters him in a boxing match.
</li><li> 1973/74 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em> episode "The Mysterious Moles". Maximums Mole is very weak-willed and dominated by his wife Minimus Mole. She's about twice his size, has a loud voice, and regularly insults and demeans him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> character John Doormat is this trope incarnate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">As his name indicates</a>, he is a total pushover, lorded over by his battleaxe of a wife. One episode does have him become more assertive, which Mrs. Doormat finds irresistible. But the moment they meet eye to eye, he shrinks back to his former self. In another cartoon his neighbor gives him flack over it, but then John discovers that he is just as henpecked as he is, if not more so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> have an inversion of the trope in Sally Impossible. Richard Impossible acts like the worst sort of cold, jealous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">controlling</a> bastard, keeping his wife shut up indoors at all times so the disfiguring condition <em>he inflicted on her</em> won't embarrass him. This is portrayed as pretty clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">abusive</a> and disturbing, but on the other hand, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> at the same time. Sally is much more sympathetic than her husband, but she's also portrayed as sort of comically pathetic in much the same way the classic male Henpecked Husband is. In fact, she's possibly even more absurdly spineless — she throws herself at any male character she meets, begging them to take her away from Richard, but makes no attempt to leave him <em>without</em> another man to take care of her. She eventually gets up the courage to leave him and is shown in a much healthier relationship with JJ Venture.

<ul><li> Mary Todd Lincoln was reportedly rather abusive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. She would throw potatoes at her husband and had once smacked him in the face with a piece of wood when he didn't build a fire quickly enough to please her. There was also one documented incident where she chased him outside with a kitchen knife, but when Abe saw a crowd of other people in town he picked her up and took her back inside, telling her not to do it in front of the neighbors. She suffered from severe mental illness (likely bipolar disorder) and was institutionalized by her own son later in life. The fact that Lincoln himself was killed by an assassin right in front of her probably didn't help her condition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> was this to her husband Francis, although she did care for him. Being married to a beautiful, charming, and intelligent queen who has palaces and hundreds of thousands of soldiers and lives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Austria</a> has its advantages obviously. But it can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">awkward</a>, particularly given that <em>she</em> is the ruler of a vast Empire, and that even though <em>you</em> are the one with the title "Emperor", you have it because you were fortunate enough to marry her...
</li><li> According to tradition, Socrates was this to his wife Xanthippe (who was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">considerably younger than him</a>). One account depicts the furious Xanthippe pouring a chamber pot over his head. While accounts on her personality vary, a number of accounts (most notably Xenophon) depict her as a nagging, scolding harpy. Whether these accounts were true or simply exaggerations of Xanthippe's personality flaws is debated. Nevertheless, the influence of several accounts has led to Xanthippe's name becoming a synonym for a shrewish woman.
</li><li> By some accounts, Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">One really wonders why he allowed men to have several wives, then.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Maybe so they would henpeck each other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">instead of their husbands?</a>
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>, Marshal Edouard Mortier was "a brave man, but his wife pushed him around".
</li><li> A more certain case from the same era is Camillo Borghese, Napoleon's brother-in-law by virtue of having married his sister Pauline. Despite being the one with the princely title (Pauline married him before the Empire was established) and the rightful owner of the jewels that Pauline loved to wear, she tyrannised him in his own home... not so surprising considering her own brother's personality.
</li><li> Napoleon himself might have been a milder example. He claimed that Joséphine was the only one who could make him yield on anything.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a> says that his wife isn't in his videos (aside from a voice a couple of times) because it'd be too unnatural for him telling her what to do.
