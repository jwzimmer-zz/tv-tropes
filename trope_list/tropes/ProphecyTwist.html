</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy">It's even worse when you think you have them figured out.</a>
</p><p>Half the time they work much like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a>. A prophecy may <em>seem</em> to predict the death of a character, or of a set of characters, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, but then it turns out that there's some other reason for such-and-such to occur. (Like if a character "isn't coming back" from some sojourn to, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a>, they may survive, but then stay in the future.)
</p><p>The other half are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation">impossibly cryptic</a>, often using incredibly flowery metaphors. "The sun will rise on Christmas Day" has an obvious literal interpretation, but the sun in question might actually be the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli, an H-bomb, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">British tabloid</a>. It might, through standard symbolism, mean gold, or something golden, love in general or a particular pair of lovers. It could refer to Japan, Uruguay or the Jesuits, all of whom use a sun in their flag. It could be a person whose name means 'sun', such as Elanor, Eloise, Sol, Sorin... It could be any of a thousand things. And if it's spoken rather than written that opens up situations where the prophecy refers to a "son" rather than "the sun."
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>"Rise" has multiple meanings too, and there are several possible dates for Christmas. If the prophecy is said to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyPreciseTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyPreciseTranslation">translation</a>, there's additional room for obscurity. Perhaps rise should be raise  the same word in some languages. Perhaps the real meaning involves bi- or trilingual puns, or Hittite idioms. The technical term for the little "twist" in such a prophecy (or any riddle, contract, etc) is "quibble" (although it's most commonly used for when the twist turns on legalistic nitpicking).
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a> can be another technique: in "The duke yet lives who the king shall betray", will the king betray the duke, or the duke the king? And since most prophecies are spoken, there is always the possibility <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMondegreen">that it was simply misheard</a>. Remember, when it comes to prophecy, homonyms are definitely not your friends. If the prophecy is old enough to have been recorded in a dead language, the original wording may also be forgotten, replaced by a less-clear translation  or in the worst-case scenario, multiple translations, at least two of which directly contradict each other.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In any case, the prophecies generally rely on a heaping dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning">Double Meanings</a> to give them their ambiguous nature.
</p><p>Sometimes, of course, the most literal meaning is correct. Such an instance can still be a meta-Twist if the witnesses to the prophecy's proclamation suspect a twist.
</p><p>Deciding what the prophecy actually meant, and whether it's literal or deeply cryptic, is then impossible until after it has happened, which is part of the mechanism of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self Fulfilling Prophecies</a>. It's because no one understood the real meaning that the attempts to avert it made it come true.
</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>; the "cryptic" prophecy was a staple of ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>.

For when the "real meaning" relies on an extremely dubious interpretation (beyond what a reasonable person would consider valid) of the original prophecy, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">Metaphorically True</a>. For when the vision looks like someone dying, but turns out to be a clone, robot, shapeshifter, identical twin, or other impostor, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">Actually a Doombot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">Twin Switch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin">Backup Twin</a>.

</li><li> The manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> had Lucia raised as a civilian, in the human world no less, because it was foreseen that she would see great hardship as the sea kingdoms were destroyed. Of course, it happened anyway, and she turned out all right. The anime didn't even include the prophecy and gave her a normal princess life.
</li><li> The entire main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em> is based around this, with the military unit the characters serve in being formed to prevent a seemingly apocalyptic prophecy. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they interpreted the prophecy correct in some areas (the "Tower of Law being burned to the ground" referring to the TSAB Ground Forces HQ being attacked and wrecked), but got another part wrong: the "ship of Law that protects the stars" doesn't refer to the TSAB's fleet and space base, but rather to the Saint's Cradle, a massive warship from the ancient Kingdom of Belka. It's co-opted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> near the end, and the last few episodes are the protagonists going all out to stop it...which they succeed in disabling, allowing the Cradle to be vaporized in orbit by the combined TSAB fleet sent to stop it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders</a></em> features Boingo, user of the Stand named after the Egyptian god Thoth, which is a manga that predicts the future. Of course, to keep the characters and audience on their toes, every prediction is subject to this or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy">Prophetic Fallacy</a>. For example:
<ul><li> Thoth predicts Jotaro will have his face split in half via an explosion caused by a bomb disguised as an orange. Boingo's brother Oingo goes to set the trap. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oingo has to use his own Stand to disguise himself as Jotaro to avoid being caught, and gets stuck with the bomb. Note that since Thoth is a manga, the prediction is shown through an <em>illustration</em> of Jotaro getting blown up.</span>) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Jotaro would indeed end up meeting his end via getting his face split in half, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StoneOcean">22 years later</a> and under different circumstances</span>.
</li><li> Later, Thoth shows Hol Horse a prophecy that says "At 12:00, the bullets go through the head!", with a picture of Jotaro getting shot. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hol Horse follows the prophecy's prediction but misses the heroes, then discovers his wristwatch was fast and he fired too early. Panicking, he grabs Thoth and holds it up in front of him... at which point the bullets ricochet and pierce the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTreacheryOfImages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTreacheryOfImages">picture</a></em> of Jotaro to hit Hol Horse.</span>)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RGVeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RGVeda">RG Veda</a></em> has a particularly tragic example: the prophecy that everyone thinks predicts the overthrow of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Taishakuten by the Six Stars actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> predicts Ashura awakening to his true identity as the god of destruction, killing all of his companions, and annihilating the world. Taishakuten's acts of tyranny had actually been attempts to prevent this from coming to pass. It almost came true, too, except that Ashura <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">couldn't bring himself to kill Yasha-oh</a>, and turned his blade on himself instead.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Mary Magdalene is a seer that has had constant dreams of someone named <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chrono</span> would be the one to "take her life". When she meets the person from her dreams and tells him of the prophecy, both assume that it means he'll kill her—but it turns out the prophecy's wording is deceptive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In reality, Chrono literally takes away her lifespan to supply his powers through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">a demonic contract</a>. It appears he kills her completely (and in the manga he believes that was the case), but her spirit lives on inside the watch that seals his powers, guiding him and Rosette.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>, Musica sees a vision of Haru stabbing a helpless Ellie with his sword Ten Commandments. The event later plays itself out when Haru is seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">forced to kill</a> a self-destructing Ellie, but is revealed in the aftermath to have used an alternate form of the sword to merely phase the sword through her body and seal her unstable powers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Madame Shyarly, the resident fortuneteller of Fishman Island, makes a prediction that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luffy will destroy Fishman Island, very soon.</span> The arc ended with Straw Hats saving the island, but it's highly likely this prophecy will come true. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Said soothsayer has NEVER been wrong, accurately predicting Great Era of Pirates, and Whitebeard's death.</span>
</li><li> In the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>, the titular character proves he's from the future by predicting that main character Nobita will hang himself in 30 minutes and then be burned alive ten minutes later. Nobita scoffs, but then thirty minutes later, he slips while getting a shuttlecock off the roof and his shirt collar gets caught on a tree branch, making another character joke that he hung himself. Ten minutes later, he falls into a full bathtub and dries himself out in front of a space heater. The phrase "to burn alive" in Japanese is similar to "to warm in front of a fire."

<ul><li> While the New and Old Testaments have plenty of straightforward prophecies, they are also full of Prophecy Twists. As an example, the Messiah was prophesied to be a Nazarene, which was a Jew who had taken a certain special type of vow, as well as the title for people from the town of Nazareth. Saint John the Baptist was the former sort of Nazarene, while his cousin Jesus Christ was the latter.
</li><li> On the other hand, Jesus several times prophesies that he will be killed, and will rise on the third day—and yet, both his death and his resurrection seem to take his disciples completely by surprise. Presumably they were looking for a Prophecy Twist that wasn't there. After all, the Messiah <em>can't</em> die, so there's got to be a hidden meaning... (maybe they assumed it was symbolic or something)
<ul><li> Quite a few of his prophecies of oncoming death and resurrection are of the "bizarre metaphor" variety, such as saying the Temple will be destroyed and he will rebuild it in three days. (The Temple in question is his body, not the big building.)
</li></ul></li><li> Isaiah's prophecy of Jesus' birth also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning">Double Meaning</a>. Certainly, he did mention a virgin having a child, but at the time he was talking to the King about a young woman in their time who was about to be married, and certain events that would take place between her having a child by her husband and that child's coming of age; she certainly wasn't going to be a virgin by the time the kid was born! As with much else concerning Jesus, his Virgin Birth was a retread with a bit of a twist on old prophecies that had—in a way—been fulfilled already.
</li><li> The prophet Jonah told the people of Nineveh that in forty days, their city would be "overturned." The people of Nineveh then repented so thoroughly, God decided not to destroy them. The twist: the Hebrew word for "overturn" also means "transform."

Too bad Oedipus didn't find out he was adopted until after he had four kids with his biological mother, even though his birth parents left him on a mountain to die. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">Oops.</a>

<ul><li> A variation has him 'to be struck down by a bolt from above'. So he never went out during storms.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Ulster Cycle</em>, Medb is the enemy of King Conchobar of Ulster. She asks a druid which of her sons will kill Conchobar and is told "Maine". Since none of her sons are called Maine, she renames <em>all</em> of them, just to be sure.

</li><li> In the "Cupid and Psyche" myth, the oracle of Delphi prophesizes that Psyche's husband will not be a mortal lover but "a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist". Psyche and her family take this to mean that her husband will be a horrible beast that will make her miserable but the oracle is actually describing Cupid whose arrows of love can't be resisted by any god or man.

The part about being safe until Klinty's Wood (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">cute</a>) comes up to his castle is made a lot easier when you know Klinty is the leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">treemen</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">No Man of Woman Born</a> is much riskier when your opponents feature not just a man who was born by C-section but a woman, the aforementioned treemen and dwarven miners.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>: The Three Weird Sisters promise him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">No Man of Woman Born</a> can kill him, and that his reign will last until "great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill shall come against him." (Unlikely at best, as the two are about 12 miles apart on a straight line, or just over 18 miles apart following the roads. With a couple of river crossing in between them as well.) In the final battle between Macbeth and Malcolm's armies, Malcolm has his men camouflage themselves by breaking off branches form the trees of Birnam Wood and put them in their hats before they march on Dunsinane hill. Just before the final duel, there's this exchange between Macbeth and Macduff:
<div class="indent"><span class="asscaps">Macbeth</span>: Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; <br/>I bear a charmed life, which must not yield <br/>To one of woman born. <br/><br/><span class="asscaps">Macduff</span>: Despair thy charm, <br/>And let the angel whom thou still hast served <br/>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb <br/>Untimely ripp'd.
</div><dl><dt></dt><dd> Poor Macbeth believed it and thought himself safe.
</dd></dl><ul><li> The 2006 film with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate">Setting Update</a> to a modern day gangster story has the Birnham Wood part fulfilled by Malcolm's forces using a lumber truck to break down the front gate of Macbeth's house. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> version has Macduff's troops use branches from the wood as camouflage instead. The 2015 film adapts it by having Malcolm's forces burn the woods as their camouflage, and the wind then carries the ashes into Macbeth's castle.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Shakespeare example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em>. Richard created a false prophecy to set his brother Clarence and the king against each other. The prophecy stated that "G" would murder the king's heirs. The king decided this must be <em>George</em>, Duke of Clarence. Richard, who ultimately did murder the king's heirs, was Duke of <em>Gloucester</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryVIPart2">Henry VI Part 2</a></em>, a prophetic spirit is asked what will become of the Duke of Somerset. It says he should "shun castles." He is killed by a young Richard Gloucester outside the Castle Inn in St. Albans. The spirit says the Duke of Suffolk will meet his death by water. He is taken prisoner and put into the keeping of a soldier named "Walter" (whose name in some English dialects would be pronounced the same as "water").
<ul><li> The same spirit, asked about the contest between King Henry VI and the Duke of York, says "The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose / But him outlive, and die a violent death." This is as ambiguous as the prophecy given to Pyrrhus (under "real life" below). As with that prophecy, it ends up being fulfilled both ways...York and Henry "depose" each other, and both die violent deaths.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Shakespeare example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV">Henry IV</a></em>: King Henry was told a prophesy that he would die in Jerusalem, and believed this would entail going Crusading or otherwise journeying to the Holy Land to repent of his sins. Toward the end of the second part of the play, Henry becomes ill and collapses and is brought to a room in the palace. He asks the name of the room, and is told it is called the "Jerusalem Chamber". He then realizes he will die in the room.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnceUponAMattress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnceUponAMattress">Once Upon a Mattress</a></em>, the King is cursed to remain mute "until the mouse devours the hawk." The literal attempt to fulfill this condition obviously fails: by Dauntless's account, "the mouse got scared and ran away and the hawk bit Daddy." The prophecy is ultimately fulfilled when Dauntless stops being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a> and yells at his mother to shut up.
</li><li> Elements of the upbeat song "The Wizard and I" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em> follow this - Elphaba (the future Wicked Witch of the West) envisions her future popularity, in which "when people see me they will scream" and there'll be "a celebration throughout Oz that's all to do with me". Thinking about it apparently makes her "so happy I could melt". So... Yeah.
<ul><li> Fiyero has his moments of this as well, once in the song 'Dancing Through Life' when he says "Life's more painless/for the brainless" as well as in 'As Long As You're Mine' when he says "Maybe I'm brainless" He eventually becomes the<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Scarecrow</span>
</li><li> Even the Wizard joins in on the fun, when he says in the song 'Sentimental Man' that he is "a sentimental man/who always longed to be a father" at the end of the play, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wizard is Elphaba's father</span>.

However, what they - and everybody since - didn't realize was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both warriors are one and the same person</span>. The champion of the Ancients is supposed to save Nosgoth and restore the Vampire race to glory, while the Hylden champion is supposed to ruin Nosgoth and free the Hylden from their prison. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By using the heart of darkness to revive Janos, Raziel provides the Hylden with the vessel they need for their General to possess Janos, allowing him to enact a plan that eventually leads to a time of great ruin for Nosgoth and frees the Hylden. But then, by allowing Kain to kill him and purifying his corruption, Raziel gives Kain the power to restore the pillars lead Nosgoth into a golden age.</span>
<ul><li> As for the "one champion destroys the other" part? Raziel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">willingly commits suicide to heal and arm Kain.</span> For bonus points, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he does so using the Reaver - his own time-displaced self!</span>
</li><li> Also, it is prophesied that Raziel will kill Kain eventually. And he does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They didn't know that as the Scion of Balance, Kain can't die and he just comes back to life later.</span>
</li><li> Raziel is prophesied to wield the Soul Reaver, except that his destiny predicts he'll be drawn into the sword and become its soul-devouring spectral half. So he can't go near the sword because it'll kill him, but due to a time paradox integral to that destiny, he wields the spectral version of the sword independent of the material version. As the dialogue goes:
<div class="indent"><strong>Janos</strong>: Raziel, you are ordained by prophecy to wield the Reaver. <br/><strong>Raziel</strong>: *manifests the sword, earning a shocked gasp from Janos* And so I do... Though not quite as you had envisioned.

<div class="indent"> "The dead shall bear death, the damned shall be damned, every soul of a Craftworld lost, slain without a word".
</div><ul><li> She is told she can prevent this doom by going to the planet Typhon. As such, the prophecy is interpreted as "The Spirit Stones of the dead Eldar contained in the buried Craftworld on Typhon will be destroyed by the Imperial Fleet bent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Exterminatus</a> unless you stop them". Things get complicated when another group of Eldar show up, claiming that their prophecy says a Craftworld will be lost unless Autarch Kayleth is killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Kayleth kills them in self-defence, it turns out they were delaying the Imperial Fleet, and Typhon Craftworld is destroyed shortly afterwards. It turns out that Kayleth's prophecy actually meant "Undead, silent robots will kill everyone on an unrelated Craftworld nicknamed "the Damned", unless you recover a Macguffin from the Big Bad who happened to be near Typhon at the time". While she does end up fulfilling that prophecy, that's presumably cold comfort to all the souls lost on Typhon.</span>

<ul><li> And another case in the first game, the precursor oracle statues state that the dark light (which is taken to mean Dark eco) has twisted the fate of one of them, and the pure light (Light Eco?) would put it right again. By the end of the first game, it seemed to refer to Daxter, who had been changed by dark eco, and could be changed back by light eco.

Most gargoyles believe this means they must sacrifice the False Prophet (and boy, do they try!), but in the end the situation is resolved by the False Prophet sacrificing something else entirely. One of the more philosophical gargoyles even points out that the wording of the prophecy might mean one of three things: the False Prophet is sacrificed, the False Prophet performs a sacrifice on another person, or the False Prophet sacrifices a valuable possession.

<ul><li> The Oracle gives Belkar a prophecy that Belkar will cause the death of at least one of the people on his hit list, which includes the Oracle. Belkar ends up giving a magical item to one such person, causing that person to use it to bite off more than they could chew and get killed, as well as annoying another enough to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> resulting in death, and getting another sent back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">the Celestial planes</a> as a result of a series of events where Belkar's involvement is a bit questionable.

According to a loose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">literal interpretation</a> of the Oracle's words, it has been fulfilled: The twists were that the four words were, in fact, three and a stammer (or possibly a repeated word for emphasis, depending on how you read it), the right being was Vaarsuvius themself, and "complete and total arcane power" referred to the set of soul splices giving Vaarsuvius three aspects of magic currently barred to them: necromancy, conjuration, and spontaneous casting. Along with a <em>ridiculously</em> high effective caster level, probably in the low 90s (for comparison 21 is Epic level, something most characters will never reach), for as long as he's able to hold onto all 3 spliced souls.
</li><li> The Oracle also predicted that Durkon would only return to his homeland posthumously.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That previous prophecy was also subject to a twist: Durkon was exiled to the human lands by the previous High Priest of Thor and ordered to not return until given the say-so (which the High Priest had no intention of doing) in an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>.

</li><li> A version in which the twist is obvious from the start: Roy asks the Oracle which Gate Xykon will visit next, and remembering how the Oracle screwed with him the first time he visited him, specifically words the question to prevent the Oracle from giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">a useless answer</a>, in a way that inadvertently excludes the actual answer (in short, he asked if Xykon would go to Girard's Gate or Kraagor's Gate next). To his credit, the Oracle <em>tries</em> to convince Roy to reword his question, but Roy insists, so the Oracle answers that of those two Gates, Girard's will be the first one Xykon goes to. The twist is that Roy forgot to include Soon's Gate in the question... and guess which Gate Xykon and his forces were marching towards at that time?

Therefore, things can happen in entirely unexpected ways. If you try to fight your Fate, things will inevitably go very very wrong—but still end up in the same way you were Fated to.
<ul><li> In book 0, Wanda is Fated to serve under Olive Branch. Wanda's brother tries to turn Olive to their Side so that they can fulfill the Prediction that way, but Olive poisons him, crushes their Side, and captures Wanda. Later, Jillian is Predicted to croak the Ruler of Haffaton, Judy Gale. Since Olive is the heir, she both wants this to come true and not; she's fine with Jillian croaking her Ruler, but is worried that someone else might croak Judy, and then Jillian will croak Olive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Judy escapes Erfworld</span>, Olive becomes Ruler, and Jillian does indeed croak her despite massive interference from her father.

Wanda's mentor, a Predictamancer, points out that since Charlie has been cheating Fate for so long, they have to be prepared to cheat Fate <em>back</em>. She says that Lilith croaking Charlie, then having Wanda decrypt him and Parson execute him, might have been enough to fulfill the Prediction. Parson further theorizes that since he gave the order for Lilith to croak Charlie in the first place, that might have counted as well.
</li><li> When Sylvia was a lowly stabber, she was Fated to croak in a fire. When she was caught in a fire and incapacitated (to the point that she'd croak the next day), the court Carnymancer, Jojo, was in love with her, so he cast over her for days to change her Fate. He made it so that she would only croak by her own hand—mostly to cheat Fate, but also because he believes strongly in the right to suicide. This made her essentially invincible, and she quickly rose through the ranks. She got croaked by a volcano at one point, but was actually <em>resurrected</em> by the next turn. She finally croaks for good when a fire she set herself gets out of control. Jojo admits he didn't consider the possibility that she'd <em>accidentally</em> croak herself.
</li><li> In the Digdoug side story, Digdoug's Side receives a Prediction that they will suffer a massive air attack. They try to prepare, but know they can't do enough in time, so they hire a Carnymancer to find them a way out. She suggests they attack themselves. They hire Charlie to attack with minimal force, which he does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But their parent Side hires Charlie to come back and attack them for real. They do not survive, and Digdoug himself is left a barbarian</span>.
</li><li> According to the Predictomancer Marie, a lot less is Fated than people think. As far as Fate is concerned, the vast majority of people and events simply don't matter and so the details are flexible. When Fate does care, her Predictions suddenly go from vague or twisty to being precise down to the second.

The "beneath the seas, beside the flame" refers to the spot on volcanic Cinnabar Island where Missingno is found. The lost beast in the first verse is Mewtwo (who came ashore in the area), not Missingno. The twist that makes it fit: The last line of the first verse is properly rendered as "A piece of the world, is Missing." (Meaning that Missing is a part of the world). The "path you never should have crossed" is the path one must cross to find Missingno as well as referring the fact that you need to use cheat codes to do it. Missingno costs you your save file and a lot of other things. It's number is indeed lost, hence the name "Missing Number". As well, it's made of incomplete number codes. It has a distinct hissing sound as its noise. The "bones from hell you cannot tame" are the images of fossil Pokemon Missingno sometimes appears as. You cannot tame fossil Pokemon normally. It devours all your life and fame by dint of the glitch that makes it appear corrupting the save file you have devoted so much time to and corrupting your Hall of Fame data. That's the price you pay for catching it. On top of everything else, the style of this twist is an homage to the "The Earth shall turn to Ash" twist from the second Pokemon movie.</span>

But, as we have seen in the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were likely referring to Zuko being the Fire Nation's salvation from tyranny</span>.
</li><li> All of Aunt Wu's prophecies wind up coming true, even though she claims that destiny isn't set in stone. One of her predictions was that the nearby volcano would not destroy the town that year; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">naturally</a>, the heroes discover that the thing is about to erupt, but then rally the townspeople to divert the lava. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Sokka</a> is annoyed when a townsperson points out that technically, Aunt Wu never predicted that the volcano would stay dormant, just that it wouldn't destroy the town.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> episode "Seer No Evil" contains one of these. Near the beginning of the episode, a fortuneteller bug by the name of Cassandra predicts several events that (with some creative interpretation) all happen throughout the episode, but it's her last prediction - the one related to Chip - that gets the twist. At the end of her predictions, she points to Chip and tells him that "the trunk shall fall...then <em>thppppth</em> *throat-cutting gesture* ...then all is darkness." In the final third of the episode, a somewhat-paranoid Chip is left alone outside a carnival funhouse with a giant elephant statue that's swaying back and forth above the entrance, while the other Rangers enter the funhouse to track a thief (with everyone thinking that the statue will fall down and crush Chip). Chip, in arguably the biggest test of his sense of duty, eventually rushes underneath the statue to the funhouse entrance, and is relieved when he sees that the prediction didn't come true. But just a few moments later, he runs into the funhouse, and is seemingly crushed by a falling chest (or, if you prefer, trunk) containing the thief's loot. The thief's helper monkey sees this and makes a throat-cutting gesture (as well as letting out a raspberry, or <em>thppppth</em>) as the thief leaves the funhouse, and the Rangers believe Chip is dead...except he's actually trapped underneath the trunk in a hole in the floor (which, obviously, would make things pretty dark for Chip).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Royal Pain", King Wallace II of a small country contacts the heroes about threats on his son's life. It turns out that the men responsible have a prophecy that the kingdom's monarchy will end with Wallace III, and they're doing their part to make the prophecy come true. At the end of the episode, Kim captures the villains and the prince is still alive; however, having been exposed to democracy throughout the episode, he announces that, while he won't interfere with his father's kinghood, after his father's death, he'll convert the kingdom into a democracy and run for president. Ron is quick to point out how this meshes with the prophecy.
</li><li> In "Monkey Ninjas in Space", Monkey Fist receives a prophecy from a monk telling him to follow a suitable monkey into space, where "the ultimate monkey master will be unstoppable". At the end of the episode, the monk explains to the monkey ninjas that the prophecy actually said "the ultimate monkey master will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">Ron Stoppable</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> uses this; Rico gets a fortune cookie which reads that he will meet 'a foul end'. The group tries for the majority of the episode to find ways to prevent such a curse (or convince Rico that it's silly superstition), until the very end, when a duck crash-lands on him. Fowl end, you see. Private is highly amused.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong">American Dragon: Jake Long</a></em>: Two (actually more if you bother to keep count) prophecies were twisted in "Body Guard Duty". The first one stated Trixie and Spud would "tie the knot", much to Trixie's horror. The second was that Jake would be hit by a boulder and it didn't help that the prophecy specified how fast the boulder would be. At Ogre Bowl, an ogre threw a boulder that hit Jake at the specified speed, thus fulfilling the prophecy. However, Jake was flying at a slightly slower speed and it didn't hurt him. At the end of the episode, Spud's shoe was untied and Trixie tied it, meaning the prediction about them tying the knot wasn't about marriage.
<ul><li> In a smaller scale, it is predicted that somebody would take the last pudding at the cafeteria before Rose could get to it. And it looks like someone else is about to get it, but then Jake takes it — and gives it to Rose. Trixie protests, but the oracles point out that they never said Rose wouldn't end up with it; just that someone else would take it first. Also, it was predicted chocolate milk would be spilled onto Spud's shoes. Trying to defy the prophecy, he went outside the school, where it was unlikely to happen, and a truckload of chocolate milk crashed, spilling some of its contents into Spud's shoes.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien">All Hail King Julien</a></em>, Masikura the chameleon predicts that the king of the lemurs will get eaten by a fossa... and Julien has just inherited the throne. He <em>does</em> get eaten, but only a small part of his rear end is bitten off.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tabaluga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tabaluga">Tabaluga</a></em> animated adaptation season 2, Shouhou's crystal ball shows that a great stone thrown by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Humsin</a> will destroy a net protecting Greenland. Greenlanders try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">fight destiny</a>. At the end, the stone destroys the net and than Humsin land, because Humsin's hanchman, Kayo, has stolen the net.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, the Guardian sees an older version of Jack in his time portal to the past. He assumes this means Jack will eventually surpass him and earn the right to use the portal that he's guarding. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aku destroys the portal and the Guardian before Jack can surpass him, but the samurai eventually uses one created by Ashi in order to fulfill his destiny.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus">Herodotus</a> recounts the story of Croesus, King of Lydia (in modern Turkey), who expended a considerable portion of his vast wealth to get the Oracle at Delphi's opinion on whether he should attack the Persian Empire. The Oracle responded that "If Croesus attacks the Persians, a great empire will fall," or something to that effect ("...he will destroy a great army!"). Croesus attacks the Persians, and it turns out that the empire the Oracle was talking about was his. Cyrus, however, is a nice conqueror and decides to make Croesus an advisor.
<ul><li> That example was the second question he asked on the subject. After the first "Can I beat the Medeans?", the oracle responded "Unless they make a mule their king." He asked for qualification and got the more famously twisted answer. The Medean succession, meanwhile, passed to the half-Medean, half-Persian Cyrus.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a> and Chaerephon, the Oracle at Delphi, when asked whether anyone was wiser than Socrates, responded with a simple "No." Socrates then spent the rest of his life trying to figure out the twist. And his conclusion—that nobody really knew anything, but that he alone <em>knew</em> he knew nothing, thus making him wiser—pissed off enough people to help with his death.
</li><li> In about 279 BCE, the Celtic army was approaching Oracle at Delphi, and the Greeks knew they couldn't hold out against them. Fearing the temple would be sacked, they asked the priestesses what could save the temple. The oracles considered the matter and replied that the temple would be saved by the "white virgins". The Celts advanced, the Greeks retreated, and the Celts sacked the temple, stealing much of its wealth. Then the weather changed and the Celts decided fighting in the snow wasn't fun, so they went home. The Oracles returned to what was left of their temple and declared it had been saved by the snowflakes, just as they predicted. Some members of the Greek army were less than certain about this.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrecoPersianWars">Xerxes' invasion of Greece</a>, the Athenians supposedly asked the Oracle of Delphi about their chances and were basically told they were screwed... but that "a wooden wall" might yet save them. A group of Athenians refused to evacuate their city, and holed up on the Acropolis behind improvised wooden barricades, where they were killed by Xerxes' army. Then, the wooden-hulled Athenian navy kicked Persian keel at the Battle of Salamis, forcing Xerxes to withdraw. Military historians have been referring to Age of Sail warships as "wooden walls" ever since.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s short story "Counting Potsherds" has a eunuch chronicler visit the ruins of Athens years after the successful Persian invasion. He finds that the Athenians had taken the prophecy quite literally, as the diehards did above, and their wooden wall rather understandably failed to keep out Xerxes' huge army.
</li></ul></li><li> According to Suetonius, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nero">Nero</a> consulted the Oracle of Delphi, he was told that he must look out for the seventy-third year. He thought he would die at that age, and was relieved, since he was just around thirty. He was eventually dethroned and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by Galba, who was seventy-three at the time. Or so the story goes - according to modern historians, Galba was born 3 BC, and dethroned Nero in 68 AD. (Seeing as how there was no year 0 he would have turned 73 in 71 AD.)
</li><li> The sons of the last Roman king once went to the Oracle of Delphi (initially, to ask another question their father was concerned about, but we don't know the answer) to find out which one of them would become the next ruler of Rome. The answer was "the one who next kisses his mother". Now their cousin Lucius Iunius Brutus (a distant ancestor of the guy who killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>) who accompanied them interpreted "mother" to mean the Earth, so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">pretended to trip</a> and kissed the ground.
</li><li> And while we're at Caesar and mother Earth: He once had the extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> dream that he raped his own mother. He was very disturbed about this, until one seer interpreted that dream this way: The Earth is the mother of all humans, figuratively speaking, so this dream means that Caesar would become ruler of the Earth. Julius definitely liked this interpretation.
<ul><li> Yet another story: when Julius Caesar went on his expedition to Africa, he tripped as he got off the boat. However, he covered by shouting "Africa, I embrace you!," thus converting a bad omen into a good one.
<ul><li> William the Conqueror did something similar in his conquest of England.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Constantine approached Rome in the fall of 312, aiming to unseat his imperial rival Maxentius. Meanwhile, Maxentius wondered whether he should stay at Rome and try to endure a siege or ride out with his army to meet Constantine. Entrenching was a safer option, but Maxentius was becoming unpopular in Rome, due in part to Constantine's wild success as he swept through Italy. Nervous about his position, he consulted the keepers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomesOfProphecyAndFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomesOfProphecyAndFate">Sibylline Books</a>, who told him that this very day, "the enemy of the Romans" would die in battle. Emboldened, Maxentius rode out to meet Constantine and was defeated with his army, and killed, at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Poor Max never considered that he himself might have been the enemy they were talking about.
</li><li> A legend has it that an astrologer predicted to the Czech king Wenceslas IV that he would die before the tower of the St. Vitus Cathedral. Fearing the prophecy, the king ordered the tower to be demolished; however, he died of stroke before the work could be completed. So the prediction came true: the king died, not <em>standing before the tower</em>, but rather <em>before the tower did</em>.
</li><li> A prophecy told Henry IV would die in Jerusalem. The king assumed this would mean he died on a crusade. He instead died in the house of the abbot of Westminster - in the Jerusalem Chamber. Shakespeare later references this event.
</li><li> Invoked (and parodied) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> when he predicted in his 1736 almanac that the sea would rise and put New York and Boston under water, and that American ships would be put out to sea by a power America was not at war with. A year later, he announced that his prophecy had come true - evaporated sea water rained on the cities, and America was not at war with the wind.
</li><li> Towards the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>'s life, there was a popular prophesy that Parthia could only be conquered by a king. This was likely spread either to support Caesar's bid to be crowned King of Rome, or by his enemies to stoke fears that he would seek kingship. Regardless, Caesar died before the Parthian campaign, and Rome never did conquer it. When Parthia finally was conquered, however, it was done so by a king. It just turned out to be the king of Persia when they'd assumed Rome would be the one to conquer Parthia.
</li><li> During the Battle of Marathon, the Persians had with them the old Hippias, a former Athenian tyrant. When he disembarked, it is claimed a tooth of his fell out and was lost in the dirt. Hippias considered it a bad sign - apparently, it was predicted that his bones would lie in the Attican soil, and this kind of interpretation wasn't exactly what he had had in mind.
</li><li> The legend of Y Mab Darogan, the Destined Son, spoke of a Welshman who would rule over England. Most believed that it would mean either that the Welsh would drive out or would conquer the English. It motivated men like Llywelyn the Last and Owain Lagoch to mount ill-fated rebellions against the English king under the belief that they were the figure in question. In the end, the Welshman who mounted the English throne turned out to be King Henry VII.
</li><li> The Indian fortress of Gawilghur was set atop a mountain, and built over a ravine separating the inner and outer gates. Given nicknames like "the sky-fortress" or "the fortress of the Gods", it was intended to be the final redoubt of the Rajah of Berar - his last "Oh shit, time to get serious" refuge, from where he could negotiate as an equal (since no enemy wanted to even <em>try</em> and assault Gawilghur). Indeed, it was often said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"All the armies of India could not take Gawilghur",</a> and indeed it is sometimes reported that there was a prophecy to that effect. A prophecy that did Berar absolutely no use when the British arrived in 1803, blasted a road up the mountain and unleashed their Highlanders. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington">Arthur Wellesley</a> raised the Union flag above the ruins on the 13th of December. It had taken his army only two weeks and 150 men.
</li><li> In the early first century CE, there was a prophecy going around that the ruler of the world would come out of Judaea. The Jews took it as sanctioning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts">Jewish Revolts</a>, which they lost, with their conqueror Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome and first being hailed in Judaea. The Jewish writer Josephus, whose patron was Vespasian, claimed the prophecy referred to Vespasian.
