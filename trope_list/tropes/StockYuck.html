Children are more receptive to bitter compounds in foods than adults (likely an evolutionary measure to prevent us from dying of plant poisoning while young), and tend to be put off by the bitter taste. Also, about 25% of people are "supertasters," having a higher concentration of taste buds than others: they tend to be repulsed by sprouts, spinach, coffee, alcohol, grapefruit, green tea, olives, soy, chili, soft drinks and tonic water. 50% are medium tasters, who have "normal" likes and dislikes, and 25% are non-tasters, who don't mind anything. Another reason children grow up hating vegetables is that parents often overcook them, removing much of the taste, texture and nutrients in the process.

<ul><li> Blue cheese, especially stinky Gorgonzola.
<ul><li> In <em>The Muffin Fiend</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielPinkwater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielPinkwater">Daniel Pinkwater</a>, the muffin thief is deduced to be an extra-terrestrial, because even the Gorgonzola muffins were stolen and no human would ever eat a Gorgonzola muffin.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> episode "The One Where Joey Tells Rachel", Monica bemoans that Chandler won't even let blue cheese into the apartment.
</li><li> In the English dub of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> movie, Jibanyan says that the farts of the main villian smell worse than blue cheese.
</li><li> Gorgonzola has gotten a <em>slight</em> reprieve, as despite the smell it's one of the mildest cheeses in the blue cheese family. In fact, gorgonzola-and-fruit combinations (particularly grilled cheese sandwiches) are a bit of an epicurean fad as of the mid 2010s.
</li></ul></li><li> Skim milk. Most would agree that it's an acquired taste, but it is all-too often grouped with tofu in media as "disgusting health food". Buttermilk isn't well-liked either.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>, it was hinted that buttermilk was what made Slappy so grouchy and bitter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePetriDish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePetriDish">The Petri Dish</a></em>, some coffee is sentient (presumably due to one of Thaddeus's wacky experiments) and refuses to mix with skim milk because it's so disgusting.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> episode, "Speed 3", had Mr. Fox tell Dougal that "Milk gets sour, you know. Unless it's UHT milk. But, there's no demand for that because it's shite."

</li></ul></li><li> Jokes about Limburger cheese are common due to its very strong smell. It doesn't help that it literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeFeet">smells like feet</a> (the same compounds responsible for foot smell are found in Limburger; the mosquitoes that specialize in human feet have been shown to be attracted to Limburger).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> is full of gags about limburger. For example, in one short where Sylvester is trying to keep Speedy Gonzales from stealing cheese from a ship, Speedy tricks him by locking him in a room full of the stuff. Poor Sylvester almost suffocates before he is able to free himself.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/OurMissBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/OurMissBrooks">Our Miss Brooks</a></em>, "Public Property on Parade", sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">Cordon Bleugh Chef</a> Mrs. Davis cook a limburger omelette for Miss Brooks. Brooks wisely declines, so Davis leaves it in the front yard for the birds. Cue a flock of birds flying a frantic retreat.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>'s "The Invalid's Story" a shipping box containing a corpse being sent home to the deceased's parents by train is accidentally switched with one containing rifles, which had a piece of limburger left on top of it at some point. The smell eventually becomes so strong that a railroad employee riding in the same car remarks that the burial really ought to have been carried out the previous summer.
</li><li> Chubby's Limburger cheese is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals">The Little Rascals</a></em>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, Earl is enjoying a picnic with his ex-girlfriend Natalie, and states about a cheese (likely Limburger or a similar cheese) that, "You know, for smellin' like feet, this cheese is pretty damned good!"
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> when the Griffin family had to relocate after Chris was placed in the Witness Protection Program, they wonder what the foul smell is in their new home. Brian replies, "It's either bad meat, or good cheese."
</li><li> The Queen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CoalBlackAndDeSebbenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CoalBlackAndDeSebbenDwarfs">Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs</a></em> injects poison into an apple, proclaiming "This'll make Snow White weak in the knees." A worm jumps out of the apple, coughing and choking, and exclaims "Man, that smells like Limburger cheese!" He and a whole group of worms flee the apple.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow">What A Cartoon! Show</a></em> short, the aptly named <em>Yucky Duck</em>, is set in a restaurant where one of the customers orders a Limburger cheese sandwich. It smells so revolting that Yucky keeps it under heavy lock and key, and when he tries to lift the lid of the container, the cheese tries to attack him. In fact, it smells so bad that the customer himself, who actually LIKES the cheese, is so offended by the smell every time he tries to take a bite that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgyToupee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgyToupee">Dodgy Toupee</a> keeps flying off.
</li></ul></li><li> Goat's milk is occasionally featured in a joke where someone is offered 'milk' and assumes they're getting regular old (cow's) milk, since they're indistinguishable to look at. Expect the recipient of the gag to take a big gulp and follow with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake">Spit Take</a>. That being said, goat's milk is actually <em>pretty good</em> - the yuck factor comes from how different it tastes from cow's milk - and the recipient may ask for more after they recover.
<ul><li> A featured Stock "Yuck!" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTamuli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTamuli">The Tamuli</a></em>. Styrics (like Sephrenia) have historically raised goats and prefer goat's milk while Elenes (like main character Sparhawk) find it too robust compared to cow's milk.
</li></ul></li><li> One odd inversion of this is some commercials from The American Dairy Association, which show cheese making other Stock Yucks like broccoli and peas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCheese">taste good.</a>
</li><li> The idea of drinking milk from any animal that isn't a cow or goat skeeves a lot of people out. Sometimes, sheep and horses are seen as OK animals to drink milk from, but never cats or dogs or anything like that. Human breast milk is considered fine for babies and occasionally toddlers, but gross for anyone older than that, which is where the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureDrinkingBreastMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureDrinkingBreastMilk">You're Drinking Breast Milk</a> comes from.
</li><li> Cottage cheese tends to get this both for its slightly bitter taste and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou">its perception as a diet food</a>.

<ul><li> Many varieties of whiskey, which are made by fermenting various grains or combinations thereof and then aging the distilled spirits in a wooden barrel (usually oak)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26l4c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26l4c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26l4c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It sounds gross, but aging them in wood actually makes the result <em>less</em> icky, as they pick up pleasant notes from compounds in the wood such as vanillin and mellow the longer they age, losing a great deal of their alcohol "burn"</span>. Strongly peated Scotch whiskies in particular are an acquired taste, which for the uninitiated can be described as tasting more or less the way a permanent marker smells. Others have likened its smell and <em>taste</em> to gouache paint.
<ul><li> A flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em> has Matt stitching his father's wounds. His father has Matt take a drink of scotch to steady his hand, which causes Matt to retch and say it burns.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShowWithStephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShowWithStephenColbert">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a></em>, one of Stephen's "confessions" is that he hates the taste of whiskey, and only drinks it became it seems manly. He then sips some, cringes, and washes it down with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">Gogurt</a>.

</li><li> Tea is often this for American characters. Americans don't drink quite as much tea as many other countries and are more associated with coffee.
<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has Robin trying to stop his team from drinking tea.

Almond milk has a taste and consistency that's closer to dairy milk, and has actually made inroads outside of the typical demographic of non-dairy milk drinkers.
</li><li> Health shakes are also joked about a lot for being "hippie drinks".
</li><li> Water sometimes gets treated as "the boring drink" due to it having nearly no taste.

<ul><li> Coconut is very frequent; this is probably from how older (1990s and earlier) "coconut" filling for chocolates was acrid, foul, and not very coconut-like. The stringy gritty texture certainly didn't help. Additionally, some coconuts can't be eaten raw and when it's not cooked properly it has a very bitter aftertaste.

</li></ul></li><li> Jokes about prunes - and prune juice - are common, as some people think of them as natural laxatives. (They do <em>contain</em> some mild natural laxatives plus dietary fiber; however, there is no actual proof that they are effective as a home remedy for constipation.) The word "prune" has also been used as an epithet directed at old women (as wrinkled as the fruit). Some distributors have stopped using the word "prune" on packaging labels and called them "dried plums".
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool">Wayside School</a></em> books, it's revealed that Jenny hates prune juice, and was once late for school because her mother wouldn't let her leave the table until she finished it. She later threw up during class. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">It was purple</a>. For the record, the real prune juice is a clear brownish liquid: the blue pigment is only found in the skin of the plum, and it gets destroyed by drying and reconstituting the fruit, while the interior of any color of plum is usually brownish-yellow.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ry30');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ry30" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ry30');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Plums are a <em>prunus</em>: drupes related to the cherry and peach.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Though relatively obscure compared to the above fruits in the western world, durians are widely disliked on the Asian continent, due to their garbage-like smell and how they're heavy and covered in spikes. The durian has the dubious distinction of being the only fruit banned in public places in many eastern Asian countries, like the Philippines and Indonesia, solely because of how unpleasant it is to be physically near a durian.

<ul><li> Anchovies have their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/StockYuck/Anchovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/StockYuck/Anchovies">subpage</a>. It's an odd duck (or fish) because it's rarely eaten in western society (except in Caesar salad dressing, but that's because most people don't realize it contains anchovies) and is rarely noted except as a pizza topping. Yet in that context, it is near universally used as the ingredient of contentious in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheUnsolicitedIngredient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheUnsolicitedIngredient">Hold the Unsolicited Ingredient</a> trope.
</li><li> As recently as the 70s, tongue was frequently foisted on unsuspecting kids because it was the cheapest cut of meat on the market. That's where it got its stock yuck status from. (There's a famous scene in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RamonaQuimby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RamonaQuimby">Ramona Quimby</a></em> books where the sisters enjoy their "pot roast" until they discover that it's actually tongue and revolt.) There's also the idea of tasting and eating a tongue with your own tongue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTrauma">which doesn't sound very pleasant</a>. Then, word that it was actually quite tender and tasty got out. Although most people still wouldn't eat it on a dare, enough people would that they now sell it at gourmet prices. It also makes a nice lunch meat, especially with mustard.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note623ia');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note623ia" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note623ia');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's a catch, though. Tongue is <em>tough</em> (as in one of <em>the</em> most-exercised muscles in any animal). It has a lot of connective tissue so requires extensive preparation to make it edible: either by slow-cooking it or by using a pressure cooker.</span>
<ul><li> Lobster and oysters had this happen to them as well, and now they're the most expensive things at the fish counter.
</li></ul></li><li> For that matter, it seems like most of the meat from any given carcass (be it beef, pork, chicken or anything else) that is readily consumed is the skeletal muscle while most of the organs and other body parts are usually met with disgust. Mostly due to reminding people that it was once a living animal. However, depending on the culture and the resourcefulness of the chef, all of these parts can be used in something rather then letting it go to waste. Oxtail soup is a good example.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7j7e4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7j7e4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7j7e4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Oxtails are among the less bizarre applications, since it's basically a very bony cut of ordinary meat—bone, skeletal muscle, fat, and connective tissue. That said, you have to be careful with that for different reasons—oxtail is so fatty that if you aren't assiduous about at least partially skimming the soup, you'll fall asleep after eating it.</span> Traditionally, this distaste was strongly influenced by class, since such cheaper cuts of meat were often the only ones poorer people could afford; today, however, there's a sect of chefs and foodies who are trying to bring organ meat back into chic status.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> has a bit where he expresses distaste for various animal parts, including chitterlings (pig intestines; "That's part of the lower tract. Ain't no food down there!"), tripe (sheep's stomach), sweetbreads (albeit with the popular misconception that they are calves' or lambs' testicles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ku7f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8ku7f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ku7f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually the thymus and pancreas</span>; "It took me ten years just to kiss my wife, no way am I gonna have the stomach for THIS!"), and brains ("I can't bite down on nothing nobody's been thinking with.")
</li><li> Odd organ meats are the main ingredients chef Aimsbury uses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> because he became a chef for a dog, and they're very much Moist's Stock Yuck. On the other hand, they're virtually Adora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>, and she asks Moist, "Do you think the head goes off thinking 'well at least he didn't eat me'?"
</li><li> The one "outside" body part which freaks most people out the most is the animal's head and face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eyeballs especially so</a>.
</li><li> In the case of chitterlings mentioned above, if the fact that they're pig intestines isn't off-putting enough, the pungent stench they emit while cooking will. It's usually enough to make people who haven't had them before never want to try them, and why it's often suggested that they be cooked outside.
</li><li> Organ meat also remains popular in African-American cuisine, commonly known as "soul food". As mentioned above, this grew out a class division, as many modern day black Americans are descendants of slaves, who were often given the parts of the animals their white, rich owners didn't want. As well, chitterlings gave their name to the "chitlin' circuit", the network of venues frequented by African-American performers during the 19th and early 20th century.
</li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InLivingColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InLivingColor">In Living Color!</a></em> sketch involves two men who are trying to eat at a "soul food" diner, but everything on the menu is either not available or is messily made. One thinks about asking for chitterlings but questions the waitress how it's served. They leave the restaurant when she misunderstands and tells them how they cook it (specifically, the part about removing feces from the intestines and leaving them sit in bleach for a few days).
</li></ul></li><li> Liver in particular tends to get a bad rap, usually in any work of fiction where parents try to make children eat it. Despite the fact that it's a delicacy in some places (like France, Germany, South Africa, and Lebanon, where they have dishes where it's prepared <em>raw</em>) and it's high in iron and vitamin A, many people are turned off by organ meat, <em>and</em> documented cases of incredibly high doses of vitamin A being toxic are sometimes mentioned. (In truth, the only way that would become a problem is if you ate the livers of polar bears, walruses, certain seals, moose, and huskies, not beef, sheep, chicken, or fish liver like most do.)
<ul><li> The bitter taste it can get may also be a factor in the hatred by children, whose tastebuds are more sensitive to bitterness.
</li><li> For many it's the texture (which, admittedly, can be a bit mushy), and the iron-like flavor (which tastes of blood); but the former can be overcome if you don't expect it to have a meaty texture, and the latter can be remedied with some (preferably raw) onion (which cuts the iron-like flavor remarkably well) or by soaking the liver in milk or wine (a technique called "masking," because it masks the off-flavor of the liver).
<ul><li> Liver and onions can also turn into a stock yuck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDoNotLikeGreenEggsAndHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDoNotLikeGreenEggsAndHam">for those who have not eaten it.</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://kidshealth.org/en/kids/liver.html">An educational kids' website tries to introduce the human liver by mentioning the dish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Kevin Meaney had a routine where he made fun of it.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> revolved around Doug trying to get over his hatred for liver and onions after Patti said she was serving it at a dinner party she invited him to. The end of the episode revealed that she was kidding as she knew how much he hated it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> episode "A Tale of Two Tables", Lincoln gets mad that they are having liver at the grown-up table, but when told that's how he needs to act, he accepts it and eats it.
</li><li> One of the comics leading up to Lex Luthor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a> run in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a></em> was a comic where Luthor sees a sandwich shop with a number of Superman-based items. There's "The Kryptonian" (roast beef, salami, pastrami), "Superman's Super-Duper Sandwich" (sub with everything on it), "The Man of Steel" (Atlantic salmon), and "The Lex" (choice of liverwurst or tongue). Lex doesn't find the joke funny.
</li><li> Besides the taste factor, there are yuck factors owing to animal cruelty. Take <em>foie gras</em> which is the liver of a <em>very</em> force-fed duck or goose. The <em>gavage</em> process is controversial at the least because there's a push-back from the French culinary industry which upholds it as a protected part of their tradition.
</li><li> Fonzie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> hates liver, but forces himself to eat it anyway since he thinks refusing to eat a food just because he dislikes it is a sign of weakness.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BoyAndDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BoyAndDog">Boy and Dog</a></em> strip, one of Rowan's parents tells him a story where a troll is forced to eat liver as a kid and when he grows up, he puts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse</a> on some villagers to make everything they eat taste of liver. This puts them off their food so much that they refuse to eat and end up malnourished, with the exception of one guy, who's branded a weirdo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits">Zits</a></em>, Connie is trying to get Jeremy to eat his liver, stating it's good for him. Jeremy however counters noting that he's not too thrilled about the idea of eating another animal's poison filter. It's enough to convince his dad to want to eat something else.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls1998">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> episode "Lying Around The House" begins with a scene where the Professor makes the girls liver and onions for breakfast instead of what they actually requested, while he sneaks some pancakes for himself.
</li></ul></li><li> For Norwegians (and Americans of Norwegian descent), lutefisk tops the list. It's cod soaked in lye until it resembles fish-flavored gelatin. To make it more bearable, it's usually drowned in butter and wrapped in potato flatbread called <em>lefse.</em>
<ul><li> Part of the Stock Yuck factor may come from the fact that if you use too much lye, the lutefisk <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteTheSpoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteTheSpoon">will corrode cutlery</a></em>, especially silver cutlery.
</li></ul></li><li> For some people, any fish at all is gross.
<ul><li> It has to be said most children in the UK will only eat cod and tuna, so the idea of eating other fish is off-putting for them.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> where the families go camping, Betty feels revolted by the idea of Fred and Barney bringing back any sort of fish for eating.
</li><li> This mindset is also responsible for the Filet-O-Fish's reputation as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the McDonald's menu.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note91rnz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note91rnz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note91rnz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Truth is, they're just fillets of Alaskan Pollock: essentially cod, so less "yuck" and more "meh".</span>
</li><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GaiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GaiGin">Gai Gin</a></em> hates seafood and complains that one of the things she hates about living in Japan is that "they eat absolutely any crap that comes crawling out of the ocean". She also hates tomatoes, and this causes problems when eating with a very traditional Japanese family who consider leaving food on the plate to be very rude.
</li><li> In anywhere but the English South, jellied eels. In the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, when one Anglophile character serves them, they are actually blurred out, to save the audience from looking upon their hideousness. Of course, this means the British have a seafood that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">the Japanese</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">consider weird</a>, which should make one proud to be British.
</li><li> Sushi and sashimi used to be this in the west, and many assumed that only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPeopleEatSushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPeopleEatSushi">City People Eat Sushi</a>: Who would ever want to eat <em>raw</em> fish? Sushi has grown in popularity now, though, and this has disappeared.

Atlee ends up letting every bite she takes fall out of her mouth with a disgusted face until Karen interrupts their meal to take her for a burger instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimGaffigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimGaffigan">Jim Gaffigan</a> created a bit in his stand up about her utter hatred for seafood, and how he can't understand how anyone can like it.
</li><li> Fish have the benefit of being somewhat familiar in that they're vertebrates. Other creatures which are classed as "seafood" like crab, shrimp, shellfish and squid/octopus get no such luck... Unless they happen to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepFriedWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepFriedWhatever">coated in batter and deep-fried</a>. Raw forms are out of the question.
</li></ul></li><li> Escargot is often viewed unfavorably outside of Europe, as the thought of eating snails makes a lot of people uncomfortable. It's one of the very few foods that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a> will not eat. This is most likely due to the fact that in most people's minds, snails are often lumped in with "bugs", which aren't readily eaten or really considered a food in Western cuisine. This is all the more apparent when you consider how people who readily consume clams and scallops (both are bivalveswhich are also mollusks) may show disgust at eating snails.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>, in several of his writings, claims that the French do not actually eat snails, but get a huge laugh from tricking tourists into eating them.
</li><li> In <em>World Mosaics 4</em> the player character discovers a fire pit and some empty snail shells while visiting the prehistoric era. The diary entry concerning this comments that if escargot is all the nearest human settlement has to offer, they'd rather eat their shoe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode, "Christmas Every Day", Timmy is on his way to save Santa Claus from the lesser holiday mascots. When he reaches Quebec, he runs out of food. Fortunately, the web-enabled kids there got his message to help him, and bring him baguettes and snails, the former he accepts, but the latter he tells them they can keep. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And it's probably a good thing they did, too, as one of the snails was used to knock out the Grade-AA explosive egg The Easter Bunny was about to use on Santa Claus.</span>
</li><li> In the episode, "Fairy Friends and Neighbors", Timmy gets dragged into going to a fancy french restaurant when the Turners' neighbors bail on them. To add insult to injury, it's hard for Timmy to swallow the snails he doesn't like with a neck brace he has to wear from a game of Twisty he got dragged into the night before.
</li></ul></li><li> In one scene of <em>Barney's Great Adventure</em>, the children wind up in a French restaurant. While Barney entertains the patrons by singing, the children lift various trays to find the missing egg they've been searching for. Marcella finds one that contains escargot instead and reacts in disgust.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> short "The Discount of Monte Cristo" has Aloysius complain that the catering department made Roy and Wade eat escargot in one scene, and says he would rather have pizza. He then tells them that spending money to eat snails isn't a good idea.
</li></ul></li><li> Frog legs are another French dish that Americans often find hard to stomach. The thought of eating amphibians sounds unpleasant to folks in the States (although in certain parts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>, frog legs are a popular local delicacy).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> both Zach <em>and</em> his girlfriend are put off by this after going to a French restaurant. In a different episode, Trini cooked escargot (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">which she made into brownies for some reason</a>) for the rangers, who loved it - right up until Billy told them what it was, at which point they spat it out. On the other hand, Skull <em>loves</em> them; it's hinted his family is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyWealthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlyWealthy">Secretly Wealthy</a> and he's used to unusual dishes.
</li><li> Frog legs in Australia go past this and into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal">Masochist's Meal</a>; environmentalists have been pressing people to eat <em>cane toads</em>, which are as edible as any frog (and much larger) if you can carefully avoid the deadly-toxic mucus glands lining the back.
</li></ul></li><li> In the United States military, creamed chipped beef on toast (a common breakfast food, made by rehydrating chipped beef<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10p81v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10p81v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10p81v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A product made of dried beef shaped into round flexible "chips." At one point, Hormel, which makes the stuff, described chipped beef on its website as being "like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresaola">bresaola<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnWithFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnWithFaintPraise">but not as tasty</a>."</span> in a pale imitation of a bechamel and pouring it over toast) is the subject of a lot of jokes. In army slang it is known by the dysphemism "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">S.O.S.</a>", meaning "Shit On a Shingle", "Stew On a Shingle", "Same Old Stuff", "Something On a Shingle", or occasionally "Save Our Stomachs". Jokes about it were common among other humor about the bad chow on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>. (Strangely, people actually pay to eat this stuff in certain parts of the East Coast; chipped beef on toast is a typical breakfast item at diners in New Jersey.)
</li><li> It's hard to find anyone who will portray Spam (or canned meat in general) in a positive light in the mainland U.S., despite its popularity as a precooked food. When used in the U.S. Army during World War II, it was often called "ham that didn't pass its physical" or "meatloaf without basic training", and one of many interpretations of the name is an abbreviated form of "spare meat". Most notable was a Monty Python sketch portraying Spam as tasting horrible (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam">Does Not Like Spam</a>), and it eventually became the word for unsolicited email messages. About the only places where canned meat is appreciated are tropical places like Hawaii where their compact size and long shelf life make them popular staples.
</li><li> In Sweden, <em>surströmming</em> (fermented herring, sold in tins) has this reputation. While plenty of people do enjoy the flavor, even they won't defend the smell, which makes you feel you should be wearing a hazmat suit when opening the tin.
<ul><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball">Polandball</a></em> likes making fun of all countries' national dishes, <em>surströmming</em> tends to get the worst of it. Icelandic <em>hákarl</em> (fermented and dried shark's meat) often gets a very bad rap as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, Sonic can purchase cans of pungent fish from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippySlideyIceWorld">ice-cold Holoska region</a>, implied to be the Sonic world's equivalent to <em>surströmming</em> and called "Canned Horror." If Sonic feeds it to Chip, he'll spout out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolSwearing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolSwearing">Symbol Swearing</a> after eating it, and Chip's friendship with Sonic will decrease.
</li></ul></li><li> Kusaya, the Japanese cousin of the surströmming, is similarly a fish cured in the insufficient amount of salt, so it ferments in the brine for up to a week, but is then dried in the sun, instead of canning. The brine is then reused again, growing up in stench, if not the strength.
</li><li> Sardines get this often, due to their smell and taste.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a></em> book <em>Meet Molly,</em> Molly's mother tells her a story from her own childhood, where she refused to eat the dinner her mother had prepared of sardines on toast. Her mother refused to let her leave the table until they were gone, so she wrapped them in a napkin and hid them in her pocket. Later that night, the family's pet cats smelled the sardines, pulled them out of her pocket, and ate them all.
</li><li> In the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloudyWithAChanceOfMeatballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloudyWithAChanceOfMeatballs">Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</a></em>, the town only having sardines to eat motivates Flint to make a machine that changes the weather to food.
</li></ul></li><li> Lamb, suckling pig, veal, and especially balut (unborn fowl) can be this, not because it's gross itself but because some people are unnerved about eating "baby animals". Many food animals are killed at rather young ages, but veal is more obvious (and it's arguably a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">What Measure Is a Non-Cute?</a>), not to mention raising issues of animal cruelty if the animal was raised on a restricted diet (veal and lamb were historically fed only milk so their meat doesn't turn red) or confined.
<ul><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8esshc/serious_what_revenge_of_yours_hit_the_victim_way/dxyjquv/">this story from Reddit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the OP remembers a very nasty girl from his second grade class who happened to be obsessed with lambs. When it was his birthday, he brought kabobs of lamb meat instead of cupcakes for the class, waited until she had eaten at least three of them, stood next to her, and struck up a loud conversation with his best friend about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">what they were made of.</a> The girl promptly burst into floods of tears and cried so hard that the OP could still hear her crying in the office when he left school at the end of the day.
</li></ul></li><li> Other animals such as horses, dogs, guinea pigs, and cats also get this reaction from westerners, regardless of age.
</li><li> Brains. This is in part due to many being weirded out by eating something's brain and also in part because eating improperly cooked brain can lead to several serious diseases.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TotalDramaComebackSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TotalDramaComebackSeries">Total Drama Comeback</a>,</em> when Cody and Noah are pitted against each other during the "Screams of the Thirteen" competition, they're each presented with a brain and challenged to finish eating it before their opponent does. When Noah sees the brains, he screams in horror and runs for his life.
</li></ul></li><li> Squirrel is only eaten in fiction by either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedHomesteader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedHomesteader">Determined Homesteaders</a> or the rural poor. Anyone else will find it disgusting.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em>, a schoolmate of Scout's is invited over for dinner. He's so poor that his main source of meat is squirrels. He and his dad go hunting, but they can't find much besides squirrels.
</li></ul></li><li> Rabbits used to be a normal source of meat akin to chicken, but this has decreased since the 1900s. Many people associate rabbits with cute bunnies and pets. At minimum, they're considered a "non-edible" wild animal which is fine to hunt but not to eat. Characters that do eat rabbits are either weird or they can't afford any more expensive meat.
<ul><li> Rabbits are still widely eaten in Europe and Asia, both bred on farms and hunted as a wild game, so this can make them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine">Foreign Queasine</a> for, say, a picky American.
</li></ul></li><li> In some cultures, eating insects, spiders, worms, etc. is seen as disgusting.
</li><li> The hot dogs on the rollers at convenience stores, movie theaters, etc. are the subject of jokes that they've been there forever. Hot dogs and sausages overall tend to get this due to their use of organ meat mentioned above, all the better to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat">conceal the origin of the filling</a>.
</li><li> Bologna sausage often gets this due to its strong smell, the slippery texture and how it's often served cold. The hatred for this lunch meat is so strong that the word "baloney" is commonly used to mean "nonsense" if not "bullshit." "No matter how thin you slice it, it's still bologna," which spawned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutations</a> for several decades, has often been attributed to a 1928 speech by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDelanoRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDelanoRoosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>'s political rival Al Smith, though the phrase entered American popular culture at least a couple of years before that.

</li><li> There are other meat loaf dishes similar to though less famous than haggis that get the same sort of reaction. Scrapple is of Pennsylvania Dutch origin and is made out of cornmeal and finely ground pork trimmings - "everything but the oink". Goetta is made out of pig parts and steel cut oats rather than cornmeal, and is very popular around the Cincinnati Ohio area.

"Christmas cake" (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">that kind</a>, which at least some people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">find quite tasty</a>), or more commonly "Christmas pudding", has similar connotations in Britain. It's depicted as something everyone gives during the holidays but nobody actually likes. The old joke goes that there's only one fruitcake, and we've all been passing it around for decades and decades. It usually looks like a brick in wrapping paper and, when set down, makes a sound like metal clanking or glass breaking. There's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitCakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitCakes">a trope</a> about it.

In reality, rhubarb may be an acquired taste, its tartness being comparable to that of a lemon, but its actual appearance is something like a celery stalk with a very pretty shade of red. Rhubarb being a vegetable, there are many more ways to cook it horribly than to cook it properly, and the pretty red stalk is the only part of the rhubarb plant that <em>isn't</em> poisonous.
<ul><li> In an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheWizardOfId" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheWizardOfId">The Wizard of Id</a></em>, when a thief was brought before the king for stealing a pie, his lawyer made an insanity plea, noting that it was a rhubarb pie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion">A Prairie Home Companion</a></em> plays on this with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyCommercial">Parody Commercial</a> series for "Bebop-a-Reebop Rhubarb Pie", in which the pie company's "ads" present a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">long chain of horrible events</a> happening to a person and that person becoming incredibly depressed, with the solution to the depression being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCheese">rhubarb pie</a>. The hated, hated, rhubarb pie. It's a subtle kind of humor (not surprising, given the show), which plays on the reputation of rhubarb pie in the Upper Midwest (i.e. the thing your parents/relatives/neighbors foisted upon you, which you were then obliged to eat, no matter how good or bad it was—and it was often terrible). Everybody else gets the benefit of "And the solution is...pie!"-type humor, but people (especially Midwesterners) of a certain generation get a bonus as well.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats">Good Eats</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a> offers Alton samples of raw rhubarb at the grocery store. Alton takes one, and proceeds to choke and gag, which naturally gets GR all excited. Alton responds that he's not dying (as the stems aren't toxic), it's just that raw rhubarb tastes pretty awful.
</li><li> The villian of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SherlockGnomes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SherlockGnomes">Sherlock Gnomes</a></em>, Moriarty, is a mascot that was made for a goobarb pie company, possibly spoofing how many hate rhubarb pie.
</li></ul></li><li> Garlic &amp; Parsley Pizza is used (again, often by Disney Comics) as the punchline of "a disgusting version of something that is usually delicious" jokes similar to the rhubarb pie mentioned above.
</li><li> Oriental food is the subject of many jokes in fiction. No, not <em>actual</em> oriental food from such countries but fast food places that profess to be Chinese, Cantonese, Thai, and the like, which tend to serve low grade processed versions. Most jokes about it focus on the use of MSG and stories - mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> - about the meat they use. (Stories about hot dog production <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMeat">have similar jokes.</a>)
</li><li> Culturally traditional foods (sometimes called "heritage food") are sometimes this, especially due to generation clashes. Reasons can range from it being unhealthy, it using ingredients that aren't common in more modern foods, it being very labor-intensive or time-consuming to make properly (which doesn't gel with many modern lifestyles), it using <em>other</em> "gross" ingredients, it bringing to mind unsavory memories like slavery, poverty, colonialism, etc:
<ul><li> In the non-fiction book <em>The Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African-American Culinary History in the Old South</em>, the writer narrates his childhood disgust at soul food.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamenAsDehydratedNoodles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamenAsDehydratedNoodles">Instant ramen</a> is considered to be fodder for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingStudent">broke college students</a> in the U.S., similar to Pot Noodle in the U.K. Until fresh ramen restaurants became trendy, this was likely the only type of ramen that Americans had experienced.
</li><li> Sometimes, soup and stew are seen this way, because you can put just about anything into a soup or a stew, they are sometimes seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovertyFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovertyFood">Poverty Food</a>, and soup is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoupIsMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoupIsMedicine">associated with illness</a>.
</li><li> While it can be amazing in the hands of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">Supreme Chef</a>, pasta sometimes gets this as another "boring food" sometimes, due to its dead-simple preparation, as anyone who can boil water can make pasta. This is especially true when cheap jarred pasta sauce is used. And even then any self-respecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a> would find a way to ruin even that, usually by overboiling it into a goopy mush — which is, actually, somewhat easy to do, especially with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovertyFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovertyFood">cheaper, lower-quality pasta</a> made from "soft", bread-making wheat. Overboiled pasta is as disgusting as it gets.
</li><li> Any spicy dishes, including curry, burritos, and tacos. There are jokes about how they give you indigestion or make you throw up, poop, or speak strangely, and if they don't give anyone physical symptoms, they're still shown as being too spicy to be palatable. As spicy dishes are typically associated with "ethnic" cuisines, there's also a bit of racism with these jokes, though spicy foods do contribute to gastrointestinal problems. Aversion to spicy foods might also be part of aversion to "poverty foods", as spices are often used to mask spoiled meat.
</li><li> Frozen dinners tend to get this because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenDinnerOfLoneliness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenDinnerOfLoneliness">their association with lonely singletons</a>, as well as sky-high cholesterol and sodium levels.
</li><li> Along with frozen meals, food cooked from microwaves in general tends to get this, due to how it can dry out foods and make them taste rubbery. It's one reason that using microwaves in restaurants is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a>, and they are usually only used in commercial kitchens for specific tasks like melting butter or chocolate. From a nutritional standpoint, they're better for cooking vegetables than boiling because the cooking time is brief, preserving vitamins in the vegetables.

<ul><li> Brussels sprouts, and other greens like broccoli, cauliflower or spinach.
<ul><li> If you read the news tickers, you'll see how the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em> games since <em>3000</em> turn broccoli into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.

</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Megamorphs</a></em> book established that broccoli was introduced to earth by vegetarian aliens who colonized the planet during the time of the dinosaurs. After the defeat of rival colonists, they planted broccoli as a sort of victory dance. That's right kiddies, broccoli is a sacred alien plant and that is why we hate it so much.
</li><li> One of the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> revealed that Broccoli is in fact a deadly poison that "tries to warn you off with its terrible taste."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerPuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerPuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> episode "Beat Your Greens", several parents try and fail to get their children to eat broccoli. It quickly turns out that the broccoli is infected with mind-control spores planted by an evil race of aliens called Broccoloids. Since none of the children ate the broccoli (but their parents did), they're the only ones left in the town to fight the Broccoloids. They beat them by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEnemy">devouring them alive</a>, pouring giant vats of cheese on them to help. At the end of the episode, the children are seen eating all the vegetables in the grocery store's produce aisle to root out any remaining Broccoloids, much to the adults' shock.
</li><li> Brussels sprouts are a traditional accompaniment to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AVeryBritishChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AVeryBritishChristmas">British Christmas</a> Dinner. No-one knows why. They are traditionally prepared, like so many British vegetables, by "boiling them until the vitamins give up," goes the traditional joke.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> on Terry Wogan's morning radio show is people complaining that it's June already and they've left it too late to get the sprouts on for Christmas.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>A</strong>: Kids won't eat broccoli.
</div></li><li> One thing all those vegetables (except spinach) have in common is their ancestral plant: the wild cabbage. The bitter taste is a family trait for plants in the cabbage family. They also become nasty and sulphurous if overcooked which is somewhat easy to do.
<ul><li> Just to be absolutely clear: Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, and <em>gailan</em> (a vegetable called "Chinese broccoli" even though people only really eat the leaves) are descended from <em>one</em> kind of plant that lived on the cliffs lining the English Channel. They are all one species. There are also a few more varieties, like the "tree cabbage" that grows in somewhat warmer climates, which takes the form of a small tree with a woody trunk and everything; the leaves are eaten like cabbage and the trunks are cut down to be used as walking sticks. Scary, innit? Oh, and turnips, rapini, and both kinds of "Chinese cabbage" (the curly "napa cabbage" and flat bok choy alike), are also one species. The turnip species is so closely related to the Western cabbage species that it can produce a fertile hybrid—which itself is ludicrously versatile, having been bred on one end to emphasize oil production in the seeds (which is how we get canola oil) and at the other extreme to forget oil production but emphasize the size of the taproot (which is rutabaga/swede).
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, Angelica took her hatred for broccoli <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by suing her parents for trying to make her eat it.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> to Western expatriates in Japan. Needless to say, it would probably be a Stock Yuck in <em>any</em> country if it were actually popular anywhere else.
</li><li> Natto's taste is actually pretty mild and inoffensive, resembling a bit nuttier an mushroomy pease porridge. The slimy and snotty <em>texture</em> however, and, in the more traditional varieties, the <em>smell</em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note124ibc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note124ibc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note124ibc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is usually likened to the smell of the unwashed socks, worn for a week at least, which is the whole reason for the development of the modern non-smelly version.</span> do tend to be off-putting for many.
</li><li> Natto is really popular only in the Tohoku region, where it originates from, and even there it's something of an acquired taste. Hell, the stuff was born because some soldiers didn't like the idea of throwing away a <em>spoiled horse forage</em>, for God's sake! (Still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">on the plus side</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItTastesBadItMustBeGoodForYou">it's high in Vitamin K, Vitamin C, iron, and dietary fiber!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">Or so they say...</a>)

</div></li><li> Basically, natto is a polarizing food that sticks to Japan because of its polarizing nature: traditionalists stand by it, modern types run away from it. It was used twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em> specifically with challengers who were sticklers for traditional Japanese cuisine and considered the ingredient to be as Japanese as one can get.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1390tc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1390tc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1390tc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Iron Chefs won both times: Michiba the first time, Morimoto the second.</span>

He sometimes points out that they're one of the very few foods even <em>pigs</em> won't eat.

When Yurika tries to slip Kotarou her own peppers, Sanae grabs Yurika and makes her taste it too.

First, though, the package has to be inspected by the bomb squad because there has recently been a bombing in the community and the package is considered suspicious.

</li><li> Alton Brown of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats">Good Eats</a></em> has a habit of addressing <em>why</em> so many vegetables are Stock Yuck, and seeing if he can't turn them into something edible. The answer is usually that somewhere along the line, some parent who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">couldn't cook worth monkey feces did their horrendously substandard best</a>, so that's how their kids learned to prepare it, and so on and so forth, until modern kids are subjected to something hellish and only nominally identifiable, prepared so horrendously wrong that all the nutrients have probably been wrung out of it anyway, defeating the purpose and proving that forcing your kids to eat their veggies is just another sign you don't really love them.
<ul><li> The other is that many vegetables have bitter background flavors. Adults (generally) find that these flavors add dimension to the flavor of these vegetables. However, <em>children</em>, because they have more taste buds, and their taste buds and brains are wired in a different way than adults, don't like them. (Children are biologically programmed to seek out sweet-tasting things, because sweet = sugar = calories = energy for growth. They also are more inclined to avoid bitter tastes, because many poisons have a bitter taste; this was likely an evolutionary means of keeping safe that remains to this day. So when your kid complains about eating vegetables, they're not <em>trying</em> to be difficult, they're just doing what comes naturally.)
</li><li> Another example using vegetables in general is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PreschoolPopstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PreschoolPopstars">Preschool Popstars</a></em>: The song "Wait Until I Cook It" has one girl sing that she could <em>even</em> eat vegetables.
</li></ul></li><li> The canned version of anything here, and everything that isn't. If it's good, they've found a way to ruin it. If it's bad, Eldritch rites have been employed to keep it in stasis, and what they sacrificed was what little the vegetable had that was worth preserving. The issue is that canning usually involves stuffing the veggies into the cans and boiling them in-can which rarely does the flavor and nutrition any favors.
<ul><li> One exception to this is Baked Beans (which are considered the stereotypical student food in Britain, being cheap but relatively tasty) because these kinds of beans <em>need</em> to be cooked first.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14dwt3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14dwt3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14dwt3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These beans are <em>toxic</em> if eaten raw.</span> Notwithstanding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole">side effects</a>.
</li><li> Other exceptions include corn and beets. While not as good as the fresh variety, most children (and adults) won't mind eating either in their canned form.
</li><li> Canned tomatoes are another exception in that they are generally both more nutritious and tasty when cooked as the cooking process normally concentrates them.
</li></ul></li><li> Tofu, especially in the context of those accustomed to a Western diet forced to eat healthier. However it's the <em>texture</em> of tofu that many people find disagreeable, not the taste: Plain tofu more or less doesn't taste like anything.
<ul><li> Beast Boy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> is vegetarian and is often shown eating blocks of tofu. Despite trying to persuade them to try it, none of the other Titans are interested.
</li><li> Bill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> was made to dislike tofu in the English dub. This is in contrast to the Japanese version where he seemed excited that Brock could cook several dishes for him, some including tofu.
</li><li> Neve from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IgnitionZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IgnitionZero">Ignition Zero</a></em> hates tofu. Their friend Orson is vegan and loves it. Subverted with Robbie, as he likes it when he tries it.
</li></ul></li><li> Lima beans:
<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, when Marge is praying while awaiting the impending nuclear meltdown, she promises that if she survives, at the next canned food drive she will give the poor something tastier than old pumpkin and lima bean mix.
</li><li> In a different <em>The Simpsons</em> episode, Bart stacks his plate high with lima beans and then refuses to eat them. He does this to annoy Lisa.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em>, Carl Wheezer hates lima beans so much he has nightmares about a killer one, so he can't sleep.
</li><li> An episode of <em>All in the Family</em> has Gloria hating lima beans from childhood. She has to eat one after losing a bet to Michael wherein he is able to distinguish between Coke, Pepsi, and Royal Cola.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode Krabby Land, Spongebob subjects himself to various forms of torture to entertain children, up to and including getting run over by a truck, but the one he seems to dread the most? Being force-fed lima beans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>, Tigger stumbles across a strange dimension that fulfills all his birthday wishes, and goes on a massive wish spree through song, but he keeps accidentally wishing for lima beans because the word rhymes, much to his disgust.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABadCaseOfStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABadCaseOfStripes">A Bad Case of Stripes</a></em>, the main character Camilla is insecure about liking lima beans because everyone else hates them.
</li></ul></li><li> Mushrooms. To many people, they look horrible unprepared, and the fact there are poisonous ones in the wild which can kill you is enough to put anybody off. There's also the fact that they start off as mold and are commonly associated with sick or dead plants.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note152hz2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note152hz2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note152hz2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some mushrooms are <em>saprotrophs</em> and feed off decaying plant matter, others are parasites and feed off <em>living</em> plant matter. There are also <em>mycorrhiza</em> that buddy up with plants. The common <em>agaricus bisporus</em> (white button) mushroom is a saprotroph, usually farmed on conditioned beds of mulch.</span>
<ul><li> In some Hindu sects mushrooms are considered non-vegetarian due to their nature as decomposers (which means that they believe that eating mushrooms is akin to <em>eating corpses</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Noob">Noob</a></em> the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> once wanted to "kidnap" and "torture" a friend to get him to leave his new girlfriend. After the kinapping part gets botched, it turns out that the torture part was meant to consist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTickleTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTickleTorture">Friendly Tickle Torture</a> and force-feeding vegetables to the "prisoner".
</li><li> Vegemite has a fierce reputation for being divisive, which is understandable; the stuff has a taste that is not only salty and acrid, but also <em>extremely</em> strong. However, most Australians love it. All but the most hardcore fans agree that the best way to eat it is using it sparsely, traditionally spreading it thinly on a thickly buttered piece of bread, simply to cut down the intensity. Any time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern">Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern</a></em> covers Australia, Vegemite <em>has</em> to be brought up due to its infamy and its strong association with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Land Down Under</a>. Most of the people Zimmern asks dislike the stuff too.
<ul><li> The Discworld novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>, which is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">not-Australia</a>, has Rincewind inventing Vegemite while dead drunk by boiling all his remaining vegetables in a can of beer. He tries it when sober the next morning, and finds that it actually tastes worse than expected.
</li><li> The obscure Vegemite spin-off Promite, a sweeter and milder version of Vegemite, is still a pretty divisive food-stuff, since — whilst not as harsh as Vegemite — the taste can be sometimes best described as "mashed onions mixed with sugar".
</li></ul></li><li> Marie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> mentions more than once she dislikes vegetables. She's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">apparently</a>) a woman but has a taste for junk food, especially french fries and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">anything sweet</a>.
</li><li> Donut from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LilyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LilyLove">Lily Love</a></em> is a woman who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">Sweet Tooth</a> and hates vegetables.
</li><li> Peas are also a vegetable many hate:
<ul><li> The King of Town from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eat just about anything</a> (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">things that aren't really food</a>), but according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail">Strong Bad Email</a> "different town" he hates peas. Which naturally means that if he could make the town different, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Strong Bad</a> would have the King of Town <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">buried alive in a crate of peas</a>.
</li><li> Laala, Dorothy, Cosmo, Mikan and Ajimi from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PriPara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PriPara">PriPara</a> hate peas. One of the lyrics in their song as the unit Cosmic Rice Omelette Da Vinci, "Omuomuraisu!", mentions this.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em> episode, "Double Trouble", after Mr. Conductor tells the kids the story of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS2E21TheDiseasal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS2E21TheDiseasal">The Diseasel</a>", he tells them that he wishes he had a twin like Bill and Ben, so that the twin could eat his peas, since he doesn't like peas.
</li><li> Jeffy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan">SuperMarioLogan</a></em> does not like peas, as revealed in the episode, "Jeffy Gets Potty Trained!". In the same episode, he is revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">a bratty side</a>, as he claims he wants marshmallows instead of peas.

</li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> episode "Hot Salad Water", the Titans compare how horrible tea is to various disgusting foods, and Cyborg chooses to compare tea to mushy peas.
</li><li> A recurring character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat">All That</a></em> is Miss Piddlin, a school lunch lady (played by Keenan) who appears to have a psychotic obsession with peas, serving them at every meal, and in large portions, only to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">physically violent when someones says they don't like them,</a> which, unfortunately, is almost everyone in her sketches. Although even people who do like peas aren't entirely safe.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12219904/6/Walk-the-Mirrored-Path">Walk the Mirrored Path<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Sirius loathes beets with a passion. It's stated that he actually prefers <em>rats</em> to "those dirty, stringy, sorry excuses for a root vegetable."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy">Mork &amp; Mindy</a></em>, Mork describes being made to eat beets as a situation to say, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PardonMyKlingon">Shazbot</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> Coriander / Cilantro. People either love it or hate it. There is a genetic basis for this, as the haters have a gene variant that causes their taste perception of the herb to be very soapy, while those who don't have the gene variant, just taste an herb.
</li><li> Bittergourd, especially in South Asian countries. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">The name should tell you why it is disliked.</a>
</li><li> Many flowers are edible but they're rarely ever eaten. Flowers are for rabbits and horses to eat, not people. Usually only eccentric characters are depicted eating flowers.
<ul><li> One article on the Neopian Times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em> has Jhudorah the dark faerie say, "Who wants to eat a flower?!".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfAFourthGradeNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfAFourthGradeNothing">Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</a></em>, Fudge eats his mom's flowers while Mr. Yarby is having a business talk with his father. She freaks out and calls the doctor over what he's done. Peter ends up trying one just out of curiosity since Fudge seems to like it, but finds it too disgusting.
</li></ul></li><li> Lettuce is sometimes called boring.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> has a guy named Rincewind who <em>wants</em> to be bored, so he likes lettuce because it's boring.
</li></ul></li><li> Kelp (seaweed) and algae also get this, possibly because they come from the ocean and look disgusting. This tends to vary by region, as countries with good supplies may eat them regularly. Japan has numerous edible seaweeds (<em>kombu</em>, <em>wakame</em> and <em>nori</em> for starters) and is known for eating plenty of it.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> episode "Fish Water", the other Titans get disgusted when Starfire drinks algae water at the end of the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The Asian delicacy of red bean paste gets this from younger generations who are more accustomed to modern, Western-inspired sweets and foreigners who think the taste is too mineral-like.
<ul><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLive">Love Live!</a></em>, Honoka tells her friends that she doesn't like red bean paste, which is ironic, since her family runs a Japanese sweets shop.

<ul><li> Even chocolates aren't spared from this trope.
<ul><li> Every box will have an undesirable piece, often the one filled with orange creme or coconut (see Fruits for more regarding coconut). Sometimes one character searches futilely for the legend.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, one of Homer's attempts to get Mr. Burns to remember him failed after his face remained covered by a "sour quince log".
</li><li> The Revel adverts play with this trope making it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a> style game. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XIa3C4a2Lw">Coffee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> had a running gag with coconut chocolates, which no one ever wanted. Naturally, the subject of any gag would get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">nothing but</a>.
</li><li> Two examples in <em>Discworld</em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime">Thief of Time</a></em>, Susan Sto-Helit hates nougat. Guess what the first chocolate she pulls out of the box is.
</li><li> <em>Nanny Ogg's Cookbook</em> quotes Sir Joshua Ramkin as saying "Having anything designed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">Bloody Stupid Johnson</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">like a box of chocolates</a> — you always get the horrible strawberry one that someone has already sucked and put back."
</li></ul></li><li> The narrator in Jack Ritchie's "For All the Rude People" hates chocolate-covered cherries.
</li><li> Chocolate-covered cherries have grown in popularity as a Stock Yuck as far as adults go. For kids, they are the safest chocolate in an assortment to get, but many adults hate them, finding them cloyingly sweet and disliking the texture of what they refer to as 'cherry snot'.
</li><li> White chocolate (which technically really isn't chocolate as it does not contain cocoa solids) gets a bad rap too. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> continuity, a popular game among Hogwarts students is to release a large box of Chocolate Frogs and try to catch the milk chocolate ones while avoiding the white chocolate ones.
</li><li> Many cartoons have used the gag where someone has unsuspectingly starting eating chocolate-covered <em>ants</em> (usually by some of the ants escaping and crawling around them ... which, creepily enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">can actually happen!</a></em>). Then you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>: one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAntAndTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAntAndTheAardvark">The Ant and the Aardvark</a></em> cartoon where the titular Aardvark (and a rival aardvark) fight over and try to open a <em>can</em> of chocolate-covered ants.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoeSchmoShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJoeSchmoShow">The Joe Schmo Show</a></em>, the chosen "schmo" Matt Kennedy Gould of the original season had an abiding dislike of chocolate and a massive gag reflex when it came to it.

</li></ul></li><li> Black jelly beans.
<ul><li> A guess at whose origin was ventured by an entry in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_290_27-conspiracies-behind-everyday-annoyances_p27/#2">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> photoplasty contest.
</li><li> Many of Jelly Belly's beans are like this, due to the fact there are so many and naturally they have to stretch into unappetizing flavors. This sort of variety is the likely reason they were tapped to make "Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans" during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> craze (the flavors weren't as weird as in the literature, but they still worked to elicit the dread of just which flavor one might get next).
<ul><li> Jelly Belly "buttered popcorn" flavor beans are notorious for invoking this in some people - and for having equally ardent defenders. If buttered popcorn jelly beans are mentioned, expect two characters to get in an argument over whether they're a Stock Yuck or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyDeliciousFood">Impossibly Delicious</a>.
</li><li> "Sizzling cinnamon" also has its detractors, mostly because its flavor is so very sharp that it can spoil the taste of the next several beans eaten after it.
</li><li> "Cappuccino" beans can be this for anyone who has never had coffee before and/or dislike bitter tastes (read: kids). It doesn't help that sometimes you can't tell them from "root beer" or "chocolate pudding" until you bite into them and get a nasty surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> with Dwight, who cleans out all the black jelly beans on Pam's desk dispenser, looking for more.

The <em>white</em> ones are their least favorites.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a>,</em> a food item called Stale Black Jelly Beans is available, with the description "Ick, these are a bit hard." It's classified as a Gross Food; feeding it to your Neopet will get a disgusted reaction and a possible drop in their happiness level. Even the Charcoal Jelly Beans have the description "Uggh, charcoal? Why on earth would they make charcoal?" (although your Neopet will like them better, as they're not considered Gross Food).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> episode, "Musta Been a Beautiful Baby", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">de-aged</a> Dr. Robotnik sets a trap for a de-aged Sonic and Tails, using red jelly beans as bait. Sonic and Tails fall for the trap, but are taken away from it. Robotnik watches from the bushes, but the only jelly beans he has to eat are the black and green ones he doesn't like. He ends up falling for his own trap by eating the red jelly beans just as Sonic sets it off.
</li></ul></li><li> Licorice, especially the aniseed variety.
<ul><li> This is rarer in Scandinavian countries, where liquorice is quite popular. <em>Especially</em> Iceland.

</li><li> The salmiak to almost anyone outside the Nordic countries. Then again, when you take a mineral salt and turn it into candy the reaction can't be that unexpected, at least until people get used to the idea of salty, bitter "sweets".

Eventually, when you ran out of red licorice, you had to give them a piece of black licorice, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">they would tell you they didn't like in a demonic voice</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, the description of Monster Candy (the very first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism">healing food item</a> you can obtain) advertises its "distinct, non-licorice flavor."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>, Della is able to survive for 12 years on the moon thanks to Gyro's Oxy-Chew! Now in one flavor: Black Licorice. And it gets more flavorful with every chew!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: In "The Beginning of the End, Part 2", Pinkie Pie is distraught at King Sombra, after taking over Ponyville, forcing the Cakes to make him a black licorice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitcakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitcakes">fruitcake</a>. "It's the ugliest cake I've ever <em>seen</em>!"
</li></ul></li><li> Candy Hearts. Either due to the sappy love messages, or their chalk-like texture.
<ul><li> One Pokémon adoptables website allows its users to collect user-created trinkets, among them a set of three candy hearts, each with the description, "This chalky treat is universally hated for its flavor and loved for the little messages."
</li><li> A Valentines Day episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> had the Planet Express crew delivering barrels of candy hearts to the Omicronians as a Valentines Day gift/peace offering. The factory showed their ingredients came from dispensers marked "chalk" and "earwig honey". They only succeeding in making the Omicronians even angrier than they already were.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lrrrr:</strong> This concept of "wuv" confuses and infuriates us! <em>(Omicronians pull blasters)</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> Candy corn, likely due to the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.today.com/food/why-candy-corn-so-loved-also-really-hated-1C6780366">waxy taste<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/candy-corn-hate_n_4158096.html">or texture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MooseAndZee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MooseAndZee">Moose and Zee</a></em> song was about this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisBlack">Lewis Black</a> had a bit about this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>, Skippy's reaction to getting them from Benny on Halloween is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"SPEEEW!!"</a>. Slappy doesn't like them much either.
</li></ul></li><li> The candied cherries and citron commonly found in fruitcakes, hot cross buns, and similar "treats" (fruitcake itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitCakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHatesFruitCakes">has its own page</a>). Likely due to the fact that they have been coated in large amounts of sugar to the point where they're just cloyingly sweet, and at least in the case of the cherries, dyed either an unnatural shade of red or an unnatural green color. Also likely due to their often chewy texture.
</li><li> Candies more often brought by older people, commonly referred to as "old people candy", are this to kids and young adults. They can range from cheap generic-looking candy (such as those sweets in the strawberry wrappers), low-sugar candy, gum drops, or retro brands like Bit-o-Honey.
<ul><li> Six-year old Reina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> starts whining when Daikichi gives her an "old lady candy" (fruit jelly).
</li><li> Malted Milk Balls (like Whoppers) are often considered to be an "old person candy".
<ul><li> This is inverted in Scandinavian countries, especially Iceland. (Where it's popular and easy to make due to the dairy culture)
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> shows Lou picking up a bag of malted milk balls, specifically because he used to eat them when he was young. However, Angelica likes them just as much.
</li></ul></li><li> In the comedy video <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHb3tShswSk">When your LATINA MOM inspects your HALLOWEEN candy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the mother takes all of her daughter's Halloween candy except for the "boring" ones, such as the generic strawberry candy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> episode "Summerween" heavily features this trope as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Summerween Trickster</span> is the personification of the candy that shows up in every candy bowl that no one likes but is somehow always there, such as salt water taffy, black licorice or cheap, powdery chocolate, dubbed "loser candy" by Mabel.
</li><li> Both rice pudding and custard are stereotyped as "gross/boring desserts".
</li><li> Vanilla ice cream is talked about as being the most boring flavour so often that "vanilla" has become slang for "boring" or "generic".
</li><li> Bran muffins are often a Stock Yuck, either for being plain or the idea that they make you poop.
</li><li> Japanese umeboshi candies are also a divisive thing. Though most brands really deal down on pickled plums' intense salty-sour taste, even they are still tasting sharp enough to even burn your tongue to some extent.
</li><li> The Jell-o gelatin dessert gets this through its association with crappy institutional food such as in schools, hospitals and nursing homes.
