When these rules are not followed, whether it be by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">supposed experts</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecklessGunUsage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecklessGunUsage">untrained John Q Public</a>, there's a chance for an unwanted discharge. That's when somebody gets shot. Sometimes in the face. Being named Marvin is rare, however.

</p><p>This trope occurs when somebody didn't follow the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety">Gun Safety</a> requirements or simply has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">shoddy weapon</a> that goes off, hurting, killing, or destroying a lot of property, and the gunshot is <em>not</em> played for comedy.

</p><p>This trope is named after Vincent's line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> after he exhibits staggering incompetence with basic firearms safety, resulting in things getting worse for him and Jules, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">much worse</a> for Marvin.

He didn't learn from his mistake when he shot a drink with the wrong gun on screen. You can all guess how he died off screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Mr. Monk on Wheels," after fighting to grab <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah Longson's</span> pistol, Natalie turns around, said pistol in hand. She tells Monk, who had already been shot in the leg earlier in the episode and is trying climb down some stairs to assist Natalie, that she was okay... and accidentally shoots Monk in his uninjured leg. Somewhat justified, as depending on your interpretation, either Natalie has not taken any basic firearms training, or, as it was mentioned in the episode "Mr. Monk and the Three Julies", she just hasn't actually fired a gun in at least ten years.
</li><li> In "Mr. Monk and the Panic Room," a man is found shot dead in his panic room. Also in the panic room is the man's pet monkey, Darwin, with a pistol in its hand. Captain Stottlemeyer is dubious that the monkey could even use a gun, let alone shoot his owner four times, so he tries an experiment — he asks Randy for an unloaded gun, who hands him a pistol that he claims to have unloaded, and Stottlemeyer gives it to the monkey. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">Neither Disher nor Stottlemeyer verified that the gun was unloaded.</a> Stottlemeyer then tries to agitate the monkey enough so that it fires the gun, while Randy, Monk, and Sharona leave the two in an interrogation room. Only after the fact does Randy realizes that he accidentally gave Stottlemeyer a loaded gun, and try to warn him, but Darwin then fires the gun and shatters the one-way mirror. Stottlemeyer then declares the case closed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> has several examples.
<ul><li> In one case Nick Stokes investigates how a woman got shot with no evidence of a shooter anywhere near. The answer is that there was an idiot who had a gun and made a shooting range in his backyard, which is in the suburbs and within city limits, a big-time city ordinance no-no. A stray bullet went into the air and struck the woman on the decline. When they arrest him, he protests it was an accident and Stokes contemptuously responds, "Well, that's why it's illegal to shoot guns within city limits, genius!"
</li><li> In another episode, a hunter fails to follow one of the most important rules of shooting things  always positively identify your target. So, when a drunken guy stumbles out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry</a> convention wearing a raccoon suit and wanders out into the desert, the hunter takes him down, thinking the victim was a coyote. The episode is vague on whether or not he'll get prosecuted for it, although it leans towards "no" since it was pretty dark at the time.
</li><li> Averted in the episode "Better Off Dead", when Greg is sharply scolded by Bobby Dawson, the lab's ballistic expert, for failing to properly clear a gun gathered in evidence. There was a bullet left in the chamber because Greg had mistakenly assumed that all the guns recovered from a broken gunshop counter were unloaded, as required by law. Both Greg and Sara look obviously rattled at this clear breach of gun handling protocol, and no-one in the lab relaxes until Bobby Dawson verifies for himself that the gun is, in fact, now properly unloaded.
</li><li> Yet another example when a suspect in the murder of an FBI agent accidentally shoots himself in the head in the middle of a crowded arena while trying to show everyone that the gun he had taken from Brass wasn't even loaded. He thought it wasn't loaded because the FBI agent he had killed was really just a crazy guy pretending to be an agent running around with an empty gun, plus he was delirious and on a drip at the time for 'ripping an entire necrotic bicep out of his arm'.
</li><li> And in <em>yet another</em> example and possibly the most extreme example of this Trope in the series, the CSI Las Vegas Team investigates the case of a young man who was shot fatally with one bullet in a shed that was riddled with <em>hundreds</em> of bullets, thinking at first that it must have been some weird gangland hit. Turns out, it was the inevitable result of a bunch of idiot teenagers playing games with a loaded, automatic MAC-10 by having someone standing on a second story balcony spin the gun down on a metal pole and the others would try to dodge the shots.
</li><li> A robber managed to kill a man with a blank round when he put the gun to the victim's head and pulled the trigger. The blast propelled a button on the victim's hat into his brain.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>:
<ul><li> A man accidentally killed another with a blank round. According to the evidence, the suspect fired the gun at point-blank range (singeing the victim's clothes) and it was the discharge, despite the lack of a projectile, that tore a hole in the other man's torso.
</li><li> Also from the NY team, Jo Danville's would-be killer indirectly invokes this during "Means to an End" after he removes the magazine from her gun. She points out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreMortemOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreMortemOneLiner">people ALWAYS forget about that one round still in the chamber</a> right before she shoots him.
</li><li> Sadly, this comes into play again in season 9's "Unspoken" when a little boy and girl begin playing with a gun they see a fleeing suspect toss into a dumpster. The boy, thinking of safety, removes the magazine, but also forgets about the one in the chamber and accidentally shoots his friend.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> has a variation with Tim Speedles death. Part of gun safety is also keeping the weapon cleaned and working properly. Speed ignored Horatios warnings to clean his gun and was shot by the villain when his wouldnt go off.
<ul><li> Also how Ryan Wolfe ended up with a nail to the eye in one episode; the shooter was the fiancé of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">episode victim's</a> ex husband and had overheard the victim plotting with one of his building contractors to murder them. She armed herself with a loaded nail gun and hid in the closet, which Wolfe had the misfortune of opening, and fired thinking it was the contractor coming to get her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>
<ul><li> The characters routinely break all of the basic rules constantly, yet no one gets accidentally shot — except for Kaylee during the pilot when she startles Dobson. Of course, that wasn't an accident except insofar as he didn't intend to shoot Kaylee specifically. It was a failure to positively ID the target before he fired—he shot with intent to kill, he just wasn't aware what or who he was shooting until he'd pulled the trigger.
</li><li> The only other accidental shooting is in "Safe" when Book gets caught in a crossfire between Serenity's crew, the guys they're selling the cattle to, and the lawmen coming to arrest them. Again, this is only an accident in the sense that they didn't mean to shoot Book specifically.

A decade earlier, Parker was the only cop in the vicinity when the mother of a little girl was shot during a raid, so the girl's boyfriend believes that Parker must have been the one who shot her, and kidnaps Parker to force him to confess; his belief is not helped by Parker's secretiveness about the matter. At the climax, Ed reveals the real secret that Parker was trying to keep: it was the girl who accidentally shot her mother, and Parker kept the secret because he didn't want her to have to live with that.

Who, being drunk at the time, didn't seem afraid of having a shotgun pointed at him and nods his head in approval at the idea of cigarettes. The cigarettes fly out of the firearm at supersonic speed and penetrate the guy's skull. He simply wanted to hurt his friend, he didn't think cigarettes would penetrate flesh as bullets do.

The weapon is fired on friendlies on at least two occasions:
<ul><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Church</a> takes over Sarge to free Tex, he leads her outside into the open.

</li><li> Later on, Tucker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">having finally gotten the sniper rifle</a>, has trouble working the scope while he's using it to watch Tex.

</li><li> Then there's a case where the trope is even pointed out: back in season 5, Tucker's conversation with the revived Captain Flowers ended as the latter was suddenly shot. 11 seasons later, a time-travelling Tucker is spying on this with a sniper rifle, Sister points out he shouldn't be keeping the finger in the trigger, Tucker decides to demonstrate the safety was on... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">and shoots Flowers in the head.</a>
</li><li> And of course, the very first accidental team-kill happened with a <em>tank.</em> Namely, Caboose, despite having no proper training, decides to drive Sheila the tank in an attempt to help Church and Tucker get the flag back from Donut.

Notably, she's much more careful for the rest of the series.
<ul><li> This event is a major part of both characters' development — after this incident, Broadway is a gun-phobic who destroys any gun he comes across on the nightly patrols (this does necessitate dragging them from the startled fingers of an assortment of startled criminals), and Elisa is always careful to lock up her gun, and presumably unload it when not on duty. Elisa spent the next few episodes on crutches while she was recovering from the gunshot, where most shows would have had her back to normal by the next episode. This is a key reason Broadway has no issues with a firearm in her hands: he knows he can trust her to <em>not</em> abuse hers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">It really hammered home how incredibly dangerous guns can be.</a>

What happened was that cartridges with bullets were needed for a closeup. Instead of using dummy rounds, the powder was emptied from live rounds and the bullets (or bullet jackets) replaced. Someone then pulled the trigger on one of these semi-live rounds, resulting in a small detonation from the primer pushing the bullet just enough to lodge in the barrel (this is also known as a squib load). Later, blanks were loaded into the same gun without anyone noticing something was in the barrel. The blank cartridge combined with the stuck bullet to create a lethal projectile.

Whittington survived the shooting, largely because it was small-caliber birdshot.

</li><li> A tragic example, in which an 8-year-old boy was killed by the recoil of a Mini-Uzi at a gun-show.

</li><li> Elvis Presley was an avid gun collector, and almost always had a gun on his person. According to a story told in <em>Elvis: What Happened?</em>, one of his "Memphis Mafia" members, Sonny West, taught him to always keep the first chamber of his guns empty. This led to an aversion of this trope, as he pulled a gun on someone who barged in on him in the bathroom, and would have blown his head off had the first chamber not been empty.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/shell-casing-caused-father-accidentally-shoot-kill-teen-son-article-1.2698393">A horrifying case from 2016:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> William "Clayton" Brumby took three of his children to a shooting range in Sarasota, Florida. As he was firing, a shell casing bounced off a wall and into his shirt. He instinctively tried to remove it with his dominant hand and didn't drop the gun first. Apparently, in the process, he pointed the weapon behind him and fired a round into his teenage son Stephen's jugular. The boy, of course, bled out and died.
</li><li> Several weapons end up doing this or averting this trope by design.
<ul><li> The Ward-Burton single-shot bolt-action rifle, designed for the US Army after the American Civil War, was quite simple in nature. The problem was that this simplicity included a lack of a way to tell if the weapon was loaded or ready to shoot (namely that it lacked an external hammer or cocking indicator), and that it was also difficult to make it safe (the bolt handle had to be adjusted slightly so that the trigger sear was disconnected without ejecting a loaded cartridge). Soldiers who were issued the Ward-Burton eventually wound up shooting each other by mistake.
</li><li> In contrast to the Ward-Burton, the Remington-Keene bolt-action rifle had a striker assembly that was set to half-cock when the bolt was cycled. An external cocking-piece, which resembled the hammer of a civilian lever-action rifle, would be manually operated either to fully cock the striker spring or to set the rifle to completely safe, thus averting the incidents of accidental discharge.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">Lee-Metford Mark 1*</a> bolt-action rifle, a development of the Lee-Metford Mark 1 (hence the star in the description), had been produced minus the manual safety catch of the original weapon, possibly on the grounds that British soldiers never fired unless ordered to do so and therefore did not need to fiddle with a safety catch. The Mark 2 of this rifle series put the safety catch back, presumably after several soldiers accidentally discharged their weapons in unsafe directions.
</li><li> The Bergmann MP-35 was designed with controls resembling those of bolt-action rifles and with the magazine well on the right-hand side of the receiver. The user was supposed to use his right hand to change the magazine and rack the bolt, which meant he could not accidentally shoot his friends during the reloading process as his trigger finger would be off the trigger until he finished the procedure.
</li><li> In a similar manner, the traditional right-handed controls of the AK rifle family combined with proper training was meant to prevent soldiers from accidentally shooting their squad mates during the reloading cycle, especially when under battle stress. Soviet infantry training called for using the right hand to operate the important controls of the rifle, including changing magazines and racking the bolt.
</li><li> While it is tempting to load shot-shells into a break-action self-cocking double-barrel shotgun with the offhand and then flick the shotgun back into battery with the trigger hand, this act will risk shooting anything or anyone that happens to be right in front of the weapon if the user's trigger finger is still right on the trigger.
</li><li> The AR-15's magazine release is a button on the right-hand side of the magazine well that must be pushed by the right index finger before changing magazines, thus avoiding the problem of any right-handed user having an itchy trigger finger during a reloading cycle. Many other weapons since have mirrored this, both for the same safety advantage and the fact that similar, if not identical, mag releases are necessary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">use the same magazines as the M16</a>.
</li><li> In the early days of military-grade semiautomatic rifles, most designs used a latch that locked the bolt back for loading via clips (as detachable rifle magazines were considered too expensive an option for mass issue). The biggest snag in such designs was coming up with a mechanism to close the action, as having the bolt slam forward upon the user extracting a stripper clip from the receiver (or taking pressure off an en-bloc clip as in the case of the M1 Garand) would be very off-putting to soldiers (just look up "Garand thumb" to get several stories specific to that gun, to say nothing of similar stories for others). Several gunmakers decided to use the rifle trigger sear itself as the bolt-release, so that the first trigger pull (after loading a clip) closed the action and the next pull fired the first shot. One can imagine why this feature would be exclusive to military rifles, as soldiers were taught to load up their weapons while pointing said weapons at their enemies. Civilians with twitchy fingers could possibly shoot each other while trying to load up for a hunting party.
</li><li> Modifying a semiautomatic AR-15's trigger sear to allow fully automatic operation (illegal in America without having the modified product registered) can result in the sear failing to reset itself, especially if the modifications were done by an amateur. The weapon will then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">run wild upon firing until the magazine is empty</a>.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.forgottenweapons.com/usfa-zip-22-how-a-garbage-gun-destroyed-a-good-company">USFA Zip 22<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> seems custom-designed for accidentally shooting off one of the shooter's fingers. The charging handle for the weapon protrudes from the front of the gun and is positioned right above the barrel. To fire the gun, the charging handle must be depressed, which requires the shooter to put their fingers dangerously close to the barrel. The shooter will have to press the charging handle often because the Zip 22 also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">constantly misfires and the charging handle needs to be pressed down to clear issues</a>. Trying to depress the charging handle with the offhand would be easier and safer, but as there is no proper pistol grip, the shooter may accidentally shoot a finger off his own offhand since his primary trigger finger is literally keeping the gun from falling out of his trigger hand.
</li><li> One of the oddest safety catches used to prevent unintentional discharge must have been found on the Schwarzlose M1907 heavy machine gun. In order to activate the trigger, the safety lever that is part of the trigger must be consciously shoved to the right by the user's left thumb, as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwhr4je3Smk">shown here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Only then can the trigger itself be depressed in order to fire the machine gun, which means there is practically no chance of unintentional discharge when the gun is in perfect working order.
</li><li> Any semiautomatic handgun without a magazine safety (which is supposed to lock the trigger sear if there is no magazine inserted into the gun) can still kill someone if a live cartridge is loaded into the chamber, as is described above. Beretta got sued for "allowing accidental deaths through unsafe mechanisms" after a 13-year-old boy accidentally shot his friend in the head. Beretta responded that the parents should have not left a loaded gun anywhere near their son in the first place, and that since the parents did <em>nothing</em> to prevent their son from getting the gun, the <em>parents</em> were therefore responsible for the accidental death, not the manufacturer.
</li></ul></li><li> The worst thing one can do with an overheated runaway closed-bolt-firing machine gun (like the RPK) is to literally drop it (or toss it away) in the hopes that it will just stop. The runaway machine gun is firing precisely because the heat in the chamber has reached a point that cartridges will continue firing on their own (a phenomenon known as "cook-off"), until the machine gun either jams or runs out of ammo. For runaway machine guns that fire from open bolts (like the M60 GPMG), the issue is likely a broken trigger sear, which doesn't help any panicking gunner. This was apparently a common enough issue for the FN MAG and its variants, like the US-issue M240, that users were trained to twist the belt to prevent cartridges from feeding in the event of cookoff or a runaway gun.
</li><li> Anyone doing a Hollywood reload for any self-loading or fully-automatic long-arm, where the offhand loads the gun while a finger is still on the trigger, will always risk an unintentional discharge. Some more recent media has begun to take note of the safety issues and go to lengths to avoid it, particularly video games animating the player character to remove their finger from the trigger during a reload.
</li><li> Anyone who draws or holsters a handgun with a finger on the trigger and a live cartridge in the chamber will risk unintentional discharge. For this reason, many concealed-carry class instructors in America will penalize such a person by tying his index finger to his middle finger with string or rubber bands.
</li><li> Some shooting galleries avert the trope by requiring patrons to chain their guns to the bench so that the guns can't point at their users or people in other booths.
