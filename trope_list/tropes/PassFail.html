Do they give up their white status to live as colored people in a colored area? Or would they split up, the mother taking the colored child to live in the ghetto while the father stayed white to make a living to support them?

It's a complicated matter in real life, what with humans so rarely fitting perfectly into the ever-shifting categories we make up for them. Indeed, there are times when we categorise individuals in ways that they themselves do not acknowledge, or that are based upon merely tangential connections. For example, <em>why</em> does an "octoroon" (7/8 "white"/European, 1/8 "black"/non-European) in a U.S. Reconstruction-era novel have to identify as 'black' in order to be "true to themselves?"
</p><p>It reflects many racial ideas still present (if now, less explicit) in 'Western' societies, including many European countries and their post-colonial offshoots, such as Australia, Brazil, and Canada. It's perhaps most prominent in South Africa and the United States, which both have troubled histories of race relations due to their histories of expelling, enslaving, and/or sexually exploiting their native populations (and in the US case, enslaving and sexually exploiting Africans as well). Both countries also instituted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDropRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDropRule">"One-Drop Rules"</a>, which stated that 'one drop' of non-European blood made a person non-white and thus deprived them of the rights of a full citizen.

<ul><li> Michelle Cliff's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoTelephoneToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoTelephoneToHeaven">No Telephone To Heaven</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans/genderqueer</a> character Harry/Harriet (also known as H/H), who is biologically male but identifies as a blend of male and female. At the beginning of the novel, s/he has a totally masculine appearance but wears bikinis, puts on make-up, and occasionally dresses in the genderfuck style (for example with both a tuxedo and very campy make-up. This impish black Jamaican character passes for an African man to fool an American tourist, who really thinks he has just met "King Badnigga of Benin"). Towards the end of the novel, H/H starts living and presumably identifying as Harriet, a white nurse, which involves double 'passing'. H/H is very aware that even as 'she' is respected as a generous nurse, s/he could literally get lynched for being trans and for passing for white, but makes this choice because a black man couldn't become a nurse. This character plays a huge role in the development of the very confused main character Clare Savage, a white-looking middle-class mixed-race Jamaican woman who questions the racist standards of her formerly slave-owning family and might further be bisexual. His/her ability to transcend social boundaries and to fool racists and homophobes/transphobes is part of his/her attributes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a> figure.

He had been living as male for nearly 50 years (with only two female cousins and possibly a lover or two knowing his status as a trans man), including sexual relationships with women, at least one of whom was firmly convinced her partner was male (his cover story was that a serious car accident damaged his genitals and broke his ribcage which had to be kept in bandages).
</li><li> This is the basis of the book <em>Self-Made Man: One Woman's Journey into Manhood and Back Again</em> by Norah Vincent. For about a year and a half, she masqueraded as a man among various groups of men (in a monastery, at a business, in a strip club, etc.) to see how their interactions varied from what she experienced as a woman.
</li><li> "Passing" is a common term in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> community, meaning just what you would think. A trans woman's ability to pass can be greatly affected if she started transitioning before the onset of her male puberty. Puberty not only affects secondary sexual characteristics like breast development, but also skeletal changes, such as the pelvis widening and moving forward, or hands and feet staying smaller, or the vocal cords not lengthening. Most trans women who transition after puberty have a harder time passing.
</li><li> Gay actors and musicians of yesteryear were all but required to pass as straight. Rock Hudson is one of the more famous examples. Liberace was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay">adamant in keeping his sexuality under wraps</a> as well, and his estate went to great lengths to cover up that he died from AIDS related complications.

Despite finding out that she's a half-breed, her Britannian friends don't lose any respect for her at all, and try to petition their very well connected friend to have her pardoned for her terrorism. In fact, the show, despite having overcoming racial supremacy and segregation as a main theme, has surprisingly little incidence of named people actually caring about race, to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the President of Japan at the end of the series is married to a black, Britannian woman, despite years of ruthless oppression and cruelty.

In private, he has no qualms about letting his natural voice (which sits somewhere between American- and German-sounding) show through. Matthew Goode, who played Veidt, stated in behind-the-scenes interviews that this was not based in Veidt having any shame at simply speaking German as a first language, but rather because his parents had had ties to the Nazi party, and Veidt wished to distance himself from that as much as possible.

How could anyone, even a sophisticated, wealthy playboy be expected to know that the woman he thought he loved was passing for white? This gambit succeeds only after our intrepid attorney parades a group of women in front of the jury, all but one of whom are white, and demands that the plaintiff's attorney pick out which one is passing. If he can't do it, then there's no way the jury can blame her client for not being able to do the same, and no way he should be expected to keep his promise of marriage to a woman of color.

The nameless protagonist is a very light-skinned "octaroon" (or less) in the late 19th-early 20th century, who is nonetheless raised as black—albeit a very sheltered kind of black, only mingling with the black upper crust and with an unusually large number of white people in his social circle (easier to believe in New England). A gifted pianist, he spends his young adulthood in that field, eventually learning ragtime music and touring Europe with a rich white man. However, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually quits ragtime after seeing a lynching, decides to pass as white, and becomes a businessman and marries a white woman, who does not realize his heritage.</span> The book is based in part on Johnson's life (he could pass if he grew his facial hair right), but also on the lives of others Johnson knew.
</li><li> In <em>The Freedom Maze</em> by Delia Sherman, a girl who counts as white in 1960 goes back in time to 1860, where — because of her suntan, curly hair, and resemblance to her plantation-owning ancestors — she is classified as black and assumed to be the offspring of a wayward son of the family and one of his slaves, making her a slave herself. After she returns to her own time, she is assumed to have run away and an advertisement is issued. In the description of her it says, "Could pass for white." Researching her family history, she learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after the Civil War, the aforementioned wayward son inherited the plantation and passed off his former-slave wife as a white woman from France — so as their descendant, the protagonist really does have a few black genes.</span>

A more minor character, Rudolph Wegener, tells an artist he dislikes that he is Jewish and has undergone plastic surgery to make himself look more "Aryan", although it's left open to interpretation whether this is actually true or whether he is simply saying it to mess with his head.

Oswald asks what would happen if someone weren't pure white, say 1/16th Cherokee, and when this is laughed off, says that one of his great-great grandparents was Cherokee. (This fact is never brought up again on the show, so he wasn't just passing in-universe but to the writers as well! For his part, Drew doesn't join, and his dad admits he's only a member because of the connections it gives him and he dislikes the racist undertones.)

He's only found out after his second wife was killed when they considered taking back their darker-skinned baby they had given up for adoption. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His first wife killed the second in order to maintain the illusion of an all-white family for <em>her</em> son, who was attending a very upper-class-white school with subtle social discrimination against non-whites. Or, so she said, until it was revealed that she'd never wanted to take custody of their son in the divorce, had to be bribed to do it, and she was really just a big ol' racist.</span> The best part of that show was toward the beginning, when the detectives are operating under the belief that the "white" man killed his wife because she gave birth to a black infant. After they find evidence that he has been passing, the white detectives can't get him to admit it. Lt. Van Buren shoos them out of the interrogation room, closes the door, gives the man a knowing look, and sarcastically congratulates him on passing, asking what white people are like among themselves. Feeling guilty, he finally admits to having passed as white for years in order to climb the corporate ladder, something that would have been much harder to do had he lived as a black man since he joined before the Civil Rights era, and by the time he became an executive he'd been passing as white for so long that he didn't want to reveal the truth. The irony is that when the police question the suspect's superiors at work, they say that had they been aware that he was African American, they probably would have promoted him to the Board of Directors as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a>.

This is an interesting example, as it shows the tenuous and shifting status of who is and isnt considered white- by modern standards, most Portuguese people <em>are</em> white, meaning he would be considered at most mixed-ethnicity to us (and he is accordingly played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobiasMenzies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobiasMenzies">Tobias Menzies</a>, who is a white Englishman himself), but in the shows 1840s setting (as in real life) it would make him racially dubious in the eyes of English society and the Royal Navy if word of this got out.

The daughter becomes engaged to a white man, and she starts to have doubts about deceiving him, so she points to a black servant and asks her fiance if he would still love her if she were that woman. He misunderstands it as her asking if he would still love her if she were a poor servant, and says he would. Then he finds out later that her mother is a black woman, and tragedy ensues for everyone.
</li><li> Both played straight and subverted by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partus_sequitur_ventrem">legal doctrine governing slavery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in British North America and United States. Slavery status did not depend on race, only the status of the person's mother. Since the only persons initially legally recognized as slaves in British North America were African slaves, the legal doctrine does imply that a person legally held in slavery did have some African ancestry. However, legal definitions of race did not affect slave status, at least technically. Many persons of mixed or even full African ancestry were born free. Some persons of very little African ancestry and legally "white" were born slave. Many examples listed below arise from this. Somewhat ironically, legally defining race and "passing" became more relevant once slavery was abolished but institutionalized racism became better established, however.
</li><li> The North used this trope during the Civil War to drum up support for their side among the British and other Europeans. They distributed flyers with the pictures of beautiful blonde, blue-eyed little girls who were slaves in the South solely because they were one-sixteenth or one-thirty-second black, and pointed out that if the South won, those girls would end up having to service their masters in the same way that black women did. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in this campaign ("if the South wins these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome">pretty white girls</a> are going to be sexually abused!") means that not many modern people have heard of it.
</li><li> Abolitionists held mock "fancy girl" slave auctions in the North at universities to titillate, then outrage white Northerners. "Fancy girls" were attractive slave women, usually mixed race, who were sold at slave auctions in New Orleans as sex slaves. The abolitionists would auction lighter and lighter women, displaying their bodies like cattle, until, to the horror of the white crowd, they finally started auctioning off blond haired, blue eyed women who in the South would legally be considered black.
</li><li> There was a pamphlet abolitionists were circulating in Great Britain about a Scottish man traveling through the American South who had encountered a house slave he perceived as white. What the Scottish traveler found exceptionally alarming was that the slave had red hair and a Scottish accent. When the Scot brought the matter up, the slave's master grew indignant, and insisted the slave's hair was slightly wooly, and his nose slightly full, which proved he was black. The Scot saw none of this, and thought the slave owner was reaching, but the slave owner told the Scot not to feel ashamed, that he hadn't lived around blacks long enough, so his untrained eye was easily fooled. It turned out the slave had been born free and believed himself white, up until slave hunters had shown up one day to recapture his grandmother. The man's grandmother was a runaway slave who had passed as white, and married a Scottish immigrant. The grandmother, her children, and her grandchildren were all reclaimed as lost property and enslaved. The slave's white relatives were still trying to buy their freedom back before they could be split up and sold off to different owners. Whether the pamphlet's story is true or not is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Actress Merle Oberon hid her mixed race parentage, and birth in Mumbai India, throughout her entire career, claiming to have been born in Tasmania Australia. That her claimed early life was a total fabrication didn't become known until after her death, and her actual parentage is still somewhat in doubt.
</li><li> Relics of this are still in law. Native-American religious rituals using controlled hallucinogens can only be legally participated in if the person can prove a certain level of blood membership to the right tribes, essentially making it illegal to convert to those religions. A man who is 1/16 the right bloodline could do so, but his wife who wasn't, and any children they had, could not.
</li><li> 19th-century Finnish orientalist and explorer Georg August Wallin spent years traveling in the Middle East while disguising himself as an Arab Muslim, including a pilgrimage to Mecca. He was in several situations where having his true origins revealed would have meant certain death. T. E. Lawrence also visited Mecca in Arab guise.
</li><li> 15th-century Russian merchant Afanasy Nikitin had to pass himself as a Muslim, while traveling through the Middle East and India, though mainly not because of discrimination (merchants were usually given some leniency whenever they go at the time), but mostly due to the difficulties of practicing Christianity all alone in the foreign lands (and he was robbed of his religious books at one point anyway), so he figured that following Islam would be a lesser evil. His diaries are still full of guilt because of this self-perceived betrayal of his faith.
</li><li> Shows up in Australia: Australian history, especially that of the stolen generation, has made discussions about mixed race and exact categorization of aboriginals into a taboo topic amongst people with any sense. Suffice to say that in many cases, even aboriginals who could pass for white have still suffered as a result of racist politics — in fact, there are people alive today who were taken from their families by the government specifically because they could pass. It's considered incredibly offensive to challenge someone who identifies as aboriginal Australian, even (especially) if they look white. An issue that has brought this up at times is the fact that Aboriginals are eligible for benefits from the government due to their status.

</li><li> The famous French writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>, père, who was a quadroon, and quite proud of his Black heritage (he was a son of an equally famous Napoleonic general), once tore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">some asshole</a> who tried to demean his origins a new one by this verbal double broadside:
<div class="indent"> My father was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">mulatto</a>, my grandfather a Negro,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3e5wp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3e5wp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3e5wp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though he actually never had a Black grandfather  his mulatto father's Black genes came from his grand<em>mother</em>'s side, and his paternal grandfather was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">a Marquess</a>  the Dumas family was one of the most famous products of the French colonial system of <em>plaçage</em>, where the white plantation owners often had huge black harems, but tend to acknowledge the mixed-race children born of such unions as their legal heirs.</span> and my great-grandfather a monkey. You see, Sir, my family starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks">where yours ends</a>.
</div></li><li> In mid-19th century France's high society being a quadroon was only somewhat <em>gauche</em>, roughly equal to admitting a descent from someone as crass and unrefined as a peasant — a fodder for gossip, but not something that might've hurt someone's career: the revolution had seen to the broader horizons even for the socialites.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4drv0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4drv0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4drv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After all, Duma's own father reached the division general rank in Napoleon's armies — yes, he was a son of an aristocrat, but he was half-Black.</span> Which is why Dumas could put his detractor in place with just a witty retort. In the US at the time admitting to being a quadroon would certainly and utterly destroy any chance of a society's acceptance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a>, who was occasionally compared to Dumas (when he wasn't being compared to Shakespeare) was also a quadroon,: his great-grandfather, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Petrovich_Gannibal">Abram Petrovich Gannibal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was an African prince from present-day Cameroon, a former slave adopted as a godson by Peter the Great. Pushkin's unfinished historical novel "Peter the Great's Negro" was loosely based upon his life.
</li><li> Quick examples of famous African-Americans:
<ul><li> John Wayles Jefferson, a grandson of Thomas Jefferson (probably) and Sally Hemings, settled in Wisconsin, became a prosperous property owner, and served as an officer in the Union Army during the Civil War, all as a white man.
</li><li> Sally Hemings herself was classified as white in U.S. census records while living near Washington D.C., after she was formally freed by Thomas Jefferson. She was either a 1/8 or 1/4 black and was described by contemporaries as nearly white in appearance. Of course, she was also a half-sister of Jefferson's wife who died early in their marriage.
</li><li> Frederick Douglass says in his autobiography that his master was his father but could not find any documents telling about his mother's bloodline, meaning that he was possibly even more than 50% white.
</li><li> Walter Francis White, head of NAACP between 1931 and 1955, was 5/32 black (that is, five of his 32 great-great-great grandparents were black) and was, in appearance, completely white, with pale skin, blond hair, and blue eyes. Yet, he considered himself a black man and presented himself as such, being an active civil rightsman most of his life, except when he went "undercover" as a white man to investigate the activities of the Klan and other racist organizations.
</li><li> Malcolm X = 25% white, 75% black
</li><li> Homer Adolph Plessy of Plessy v Ferguson fame was 12.5% black and 87.5% white. In fact the reason he was involved in the case in the first place was not to allow blacks to be in whatever rail cars they wanted, but rather to show that a racially based system was stupid since things are not so simple when it comes to race. The US-SC didn't see it that way. In fact, in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>, many Southern states began adopting "one-drop rule" as the law governing race because this case showed that defining race based on ancestry and "blood quantums" led to ambiguous cases, as per Mr. Plessy. (Because of the difference in laws, Mr. Plessy would have been considered white in some states but black in others, including his home state of Louisiana.)
</li><li> Tiger Woods = 25% black, 12.5% Native American, 12.5% white, 25% Southeast Asian, 25% Han Chinese. Sort of an inverted Pass Fail—when asked during the early years of his superstardom, he would say that he personally never identified as being of one race, but he couldn't avoid the world assigning him race. Comedienne Wanda Sykes made a point about this that was disturbingly prophetic—that the more he won, the more the media would downplay his being part black and play up the other parts of his heritage, but that if he ever fell from grace the criticism would be aimed straight at his blackness. He's also said that he's been harassed for this stance amongst "black" celebrities, some of them, he said, invoking the "one drop" rule. As it turned out, Sykes was partly right and partly wrong. The media indeed downplayed his African heritage during his peak years, but after he was exposed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">serial adulterer</a> in 2009, his race barely played into the criticism he received.
</li><li> Andre Cailloux, a Civil War officer in both Confederate and Union armies, as well as others in similar situations. He began as one of the officers in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Louisiana_Native_Guard_%28CSA%29">1st Louisiana Native Guard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Confederate unit raised by the seceding state of Louisiana among its prosperous free black community. While the unit was distinguished for two reasons, namely that it was the first all-black military unit in continental North America and that it was the first to be commanded by black officers, at least at the troop level, Confederate authorities did not know what to do with the unit so it languished in New Orleans until the city fell to the Union. Officers and men of the unit switched allegiance to the Union, and since the Union did not give officer's commission to blacks, the unit's black officers had to pass as whites to retain their Confederate rank. Cailloux and Morris W. Morris were among the first African-American officers in the U.S. Army, but they had to do so while passing as whites, while they had served as officers in the Confederate Army as legal blacks.
</li><li> 21st century baseball historians have suggested that William Edward White was the first black man to play in the Major Leagues, even though he spent his entire life passing as white. It wasn't until records of his birth were found in 2003 that suggested that he was the son of a southern plantation owner and one of his slaves. Born in 1860, this means he would have been born a slave, despite his complexion being light enough to pass his entire life. White served as a one-day replacement player for the Providence Greys in 1879, five years before the official first black man to play in the majors, Moses Fleetwood Walker, did so.
</li><li> George Herriman, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat">Krazy Kat</a></em> was of mixed black and white heritage, listed as "coloured" on his birth certificate, but he was sufficiently pale to pass for white. He had curly hair which he hid under a hat, and explained his slightly African features and darker complexion by claiming to be ethnically Greek.
</li><li> Defied by Fredi Washington - who played Peola in <em>Imitation of Life</em> mentioned above. She frequently had to fight off claims that she had tried to pass. She was in fact an avid civil rights activist after she retired from films.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "You see I'm a mighty proud gal, and I can't for the life of me find any valid reason why anyone should lie about their origin, or anything else for that matter. Frankly, I do not ascribe to the stupid theory of white supremacy and to try to hide the fact that I am a Negro for economic or any other reasons. If I do, I would be agreeing to be a Negro makes me inferior and that I have swallowed whole hog all of the propaganda dished out by our fascist-minded white citizens."
</div><ul><li> Keyboard musician John Roland Redd, a light-skinned black man, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> enough to initially pass as a Hispanic man under the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyNameOnForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyNameOnForeign">Juan Rolando</a>, before achieving fame as "Indian" musician Korla Pandit. Even his own son didn't find out that Pandit was African-American until after his death.
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly enough, when white men who tried to have their marriages annulled when they claimed their wives had tried to pass, and the wives said they had told them of their black blood, the women overwhelmingly won. Then, the men would be asked such question about whether they had normal eyesight and the like to imply that anyone could have told that she was "really" black.
</li><li> In 2010, white Republican Scott Fistler tried to run for Congress, but lost to another Republican. Four years later, he ran again as a Democrat under the name <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez_(perennial_candidate)">Cesar Chavez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, posing as a Hispanic-American to try to pander to the large number of Hispanics in his district, and even in a sense attempting to pass for the late labor leader and civil rights activist <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez">Cesar Chavez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He was not successful.
</li><li> Clarence King, one of the founders of USGS and a celebrity scientist/explorer in late 19th century New York City who had zero black blood still passed himself as a black man and had a secret black family, as noted by Martha Sandweiss in her book <em>Passing Strange</em>.
</li><li> "Freedom suits," where a slave claimed to be illegally held in slavery, were fairly common in the American South in the antebellum era. In several of these cases, slaves who looked "sufficiently white" claimed to be white persons who were kidnapped and held illegally in slavery. The case of Sally Miller/Salomé Müller in 1845 Louisiana is a well-known case.
</li><li> A substantial number of Jews in Nazi Germany passed as gentiles successfully. While it remains unknown whether some wilder theories are true (i.e. Adolf Hitler or Heinrich Heydrich being secret Jews), there are better documented cases of Jews in unlikely places, such as the case of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world-war-ii-a-jew-in-the-ss-a-327936.html">SS officer Eleke Scherwitz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Jewish concentration camp commandant in Latvia. He was put on trial for war crimes in 1948, after his past as a concentration camp commandant was found out while he was trying to pass as a Jewish refugee from Eastern Europe (which he technically was). However, some (such as Anita Kugler, the author of a recent German book about him) contend that he saved many lives using his position as a high ranking SS officer.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-Judaism">Crypto-Judaism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where Jews pretended to have converted to Catholicism but secretly practiced Judaism, is believed to have been widespread in post-Reconquista Spain as well as other parts of Europe. Many Crypto-Jews from Spain and Portugal supposedly came to the New World as conquistadores. At least some, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_Carabajal_y_Cueva">Luis Carvajal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the governor of Nuevo Leon, were tried for heresy by the Mexican Inquisition, and died in prison or executed.
</li><li> In the non-fiction <em>Detroit: An American Autopsy</em> Charlie LeDuff discovers that his great-grandfather was listed in census records as "M" for Mulatto as a child, but as an adult when he moved to Detroit was able to blend in with the large number of ethnic Greeks and other "swarthy" European immigrants moving there and able to pass for fully white, to the point that by the time Charlie was born this part of his family history has been completely lost.
</li><li> The documentary <em>Little White Lie</em> is about Lacey Schwartz, an American filmmaker who believed her whole life she was white, only to find out that she was the result of an affair between her white Jewish mother and an African-American man. A zig-zagged version of this trope, since most people she interacted with knew she wasn't fully white (at her bat mitzvah, the rabbi expressed excitement at having an Ethiopian Jew at their synagogue), however, she was unaware or in denial of that fact until her late teens. Her parents explained her dark complexion as being the result of distant Sicilian ancestry.

<ul><li> In various iterations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Shazam</a>,</em> Captain Marvel uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero">adult superhero form</a> to conceal the fact that he is actually a child. Other heroes are naturally reluctant to let a ten-year-old fight super-powered murderers. One of the more interesting aspects of this is a Justice Society arc where young Billy Batson started dating Star-Girl, since they are both heroes and are roughly the same age. However, from the perspective of the rest of the team who <em>didn't</em> know Marvel's true identity it seemed like the Captain was getting way too close to an underage girl and it got him in a lot of trouble. In <em>Billy Batson and the Power of Shazam</em> Billy, who is an orphan and formerly homeless, uses his adult form to pose as his own father and rent an apartment.

Apparently it resulted in an apartheid which before the war was <em>supposed</em> to be over. At one point, the ego-centric scientist Brainstorm boasts of having supported "equal right for knock-offs!" implying he was forged. Shortly thereafter, a weapon that targets the sparks of all Cybertonians constructed cold is activated, and among those affected is Brainstorm himself, revealing that he was also constructed cold. It gets added to some issues down the line, where it turns out not only was he constructed cold, he was an M.T.O., a Made To Order, and they weren't activated until after the war began, meaning he couldn't have been part of the equal rights movement because he hadn't been born yet.

The practice started in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">the early days of Christianity</a> during the glory days of the Roman Empire, but it was also prevalent in the formerly-Byzantine regions of Ottoman Turkey, in the Middle East, in feudal Japan, as well as under communist regimes, such as the USSR, where the practice of religion was repressed. Perversely enough, there are even cases of Catholic Christians pretending to be Protestants so they could integrate into a Protestant-centric society and vice-versa.
</li><li> A young autistic man managed to fool people into believing not only that he was neurotypical, but that he was a rich, young executive planning to buy their company. Apparently due to his autism he didn't have any of the physical signatures associated with lying. Autistic people in general try to pass for normal as much as possible if they can, which often means higher functioning members of the spectrum are less willing to seek assistance as to not break the passing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. Many people knew that he couldn't walk, particularly the press and White House staff, but publicly he worked hard to conceal his disability. For example, he had a customized car made that he could drive with his hands.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bpba');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bpba" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bpba');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was before power steering, power brakes and automatic transmissions, so it was far from the relatively simple one-lever-for-gas-and-brake affair seen today and required a great deal of strength to operate. Of course, upper-body strength is one thing FDR had in spades.</span> He painted his leg braces black and nearly all of his photos show him either sitting in a regular chair or leaning on somebody or something (there is only one photo of him in his wheelchair). In films that show him "walking", he's always surrounded by people so he could hide the fact that he was using them for support.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueLife">True Life</a></em> examined people who were trying to avoid this for various reasons. One person highlighted was a transgender woman who passed so well nobody knew (because for all intents and purposes she had lived as a woman since she was a child), and had to tell her boyfriend. There was some humor, when she was in a club and a man was dancing with her and she became...aroused. Another person profiled was a biracial (black and white) girl passing...as Nicaraguan. She was too dark to pass for white, so she went for Latina instead. This caused problems when her friend set her up on a date with an actual Nicaraguan.
</li><li> Atheists who live in highly religious regions that face social stigma (or in some cases worse) will often pretend they belong to a religion long after they've given up the belief (assuming it was ever there). In some cases this includes members of the clergy, who stay either to keep their livelihood, avoid ostracism, or just simply because they still believe their religion has benefits/good principles they follow. The Clergy Project exists to help these people, including in coming out.
