The initial stages of the series, if not the series as a whole, will then focus on improving the protagonist's innate talents.

However, since they use predictive algorithms to place their shields, in the semifinals Saya and Kirin discover all they have to do to land damaging hits is be <em>less perfect</em> in their strikes. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">since they're robots, Kirin can't actually inflict enough damage to stop them with her katana</a> (most of her blows just leave superficial scratches), and this fight gives the duo <em>plenty</em> of practical experience to improve their fighting skill for the finals.

</li><li> Almost all the normal titans are this. They have very little intelligence but their massive size does a lot of damage.
</li><li> Eren is like this at first when he discovers his Titan-Shifting powers. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">other Titan-Shifters</span> all have unique abilities and fight smart, while Eren tended to just smash everything in his path. When he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fights Reiner</span> and remembers his training with Annie, he gets better.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler">Baki the Grappler</a></em>: Oliva Biscuit by his own admission has almost no fighting skill compared to the regular cast, but his muscles are so dense that even bullets can't penetrate them, and can punch harder with raw power than a lot of the main cast, who've spent a lifetime practicing their technique.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a>:</em>
<ul><li> There are loads of characters like this, up to and including the main character himself, Tatsumi Oga. He has faced a multitude of martial artists and beat them just because he had superior raw power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Hideotora Toujou</a> is an even better example, he beats up superpowered characters and demons and is even on par with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Milk Time</a> powered Oga with just instincts and raw power.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to unusual circumstances <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BeetTheVandelBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BeetTheVandelBuster">Beet the Vandel Buster</a></em> can use five of the powerful magical weapons called Saiga, when most individuals can use only one. However, early parts of the series are spent with Beet learning how to fully utilize his five Saiga and Beet has zero ability in the more basic magical skills which are supposed to be the lead up to obtaining a Saiga in the first place. One character even comments that he learns everything backwards.
</li><li> Many of the Apostles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> are this, since they're so strong and fast compared to a normal human. Compared to them, Guts is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>.
</li><li> Noelle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> has a huge amount of magical power but no control whatsoever over it. Despite being noble-born, she has lived a life ostracized and disregarded because of it. Upon entering the Black Bulls, she finds a great deal of support to help her with this problem and makes improvements quickly.
<ul><li> Noelle's arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> older siblings also have great magical power, without the control issues. But as a result, they all have come to see the idea of training to improve one's skill as a sign of weakness.
</li><li> This is played straight with the Elves when compared to the humans. Even the weakest of the Elves have vastly more power than most humans. However this leads to them becoming complacent and their only method of fighting is simply to throw about big and powerful spells in an attempt to kill their opponents without thinking. This leaves most of them vulnerable to the tactics their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> human counterparts use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ichigo's unnaturally high spiritual power is what carries him through most battles with experienced opponents. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor">Eccentric Mentor</a> Urahara comments that the best teacher for Ichigo is battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">experience</a> so uses that as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinkOrSwimMentor">excuse</a> to throw Ichigo into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">life-threatening</a> situations. When the Visoreds take over training his hollow-power, Shinji comes to the same conclusion as Urahara.
</li><li> The only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">captain</a> in history without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Bankai</a>, Kenpachi fights on raw power alone. When Yamamoto tried to train him, he rejected the formal battle philosophy. Kenpachi actually didn't <em>want</em> to become more skilled, because his immense strength meant most fights were <em>already</em> too easy to satisfy his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies. It's eventually revealed that the Central 46 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">banned</a> Yamamoto from continuing to teach him because they were afraid a skilled Kenpachi would be too powerful to defeat should he ever rebel.
</li><li> It's made clear from the outset that Yammy lacks the skill and intellect for even rudimentary Arrancar skills so he relies heavily on being so unnaturally strong his brute strength wins the fight for him. He's eventually defeated when Kenpachi, one of the strongest captains, and Byakuya, one of the most skilled captains, join forces to fight him.
</li><li> Aizen deliberately stripped Wonderweiss of all intellect, skill, rationality and even language capability to focus on maximising his power output. This turned Wonderweiss into a huge powerhouse that most of his Shinigami opponents couldn't handle, even the captains. Yamamoto criticized his attacks for being too predictable, however.
</li><li> Nnoitra's fighting technique mostly boils down to tanking hits with his abnormally-strong hierro (which he claims is the strongest of the Espada) and then shanking opponents when they get too close to him.

But when he can just kill people with a touch, he usually doesn't really have to do anything creative to win. In fact, Accelerator notices this himself in his fight with Touma: after getting pounded in hand-to-hand combat, he realizes that <em>he can control the air</em>, why does he need to fight hand-to-hand?
</li><li> Accelerator could in a sense be considered both at once seeing as his powers rely on highly attuned mental calculations which could be seen as the "skill" but at the same time he is physically weak and his redirection isn't so much a wall as much as changed + to - as exploited by his former master.

In a Knightmare, however, he's a complete newbie whose natural abilities and advanced Knightmare allow him to dominate most opponents.

As a demon, Nezuko has numerous abilities such as near-limitless stamina, regeneration, super strength, and flammable blood. Unlike her brother Tanjiro, however, she has no formal training as a fighter. As a result, when Nezuko takes to the field, her fighting consists of charging in, overwhelming any opponents with kicks powerful enough to knock demons' heads right off and using her stamina and rapid regeneration to simply tank her way through injuries that would kill or incapacitate a human. The sheer onslaught of her attack has allowed her to defeat powerful enemies, even lower ranking members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s strongest fighters.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Villains sometimes fall into this category. Pretty much all of them are highly-trained fighters, but often lack knowledge of certain techniques:
<ul><li> Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz. All skilled Saiyan fighters, but they heavily rely on their brute strength and overall toughness to beat their opponent. Raditz failed to train in overcoming the Saiyan's weakness by grabbing the tail unlike Goku, Vegeta, and Nappa, and couldn't do anything when he was locked in a full-nelson by Goku. Nappa couldn't even respond when Goku proved to be his match and Goku outright called him sloppy. Vegeta is the least guilty of this, but he completely lost it when he was fighting a fighter equal to him and chose to overwhelm Goku by transforming into a Great Ape. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Vegeta outgrows this trope</a> and like Goku proved very adept at learning new techniques.
</li><li> Freeza's entire army are shown to be this; though they can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Attacks</a>, they all rely on scouters to detect and gauge ki levels, and can't alter their battle strength at will. As such, they are all caught flat-footed when fighting someone who can. Zarbon can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">transform</a> to increase his strength, but this is useful for only so long. Of all of them, only Captain Ginyu can raise his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">Power Level</a>. During his fight against Dodoria, Vegeta notes that this is due to relying on brute force, like he once did. If <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> is any indication, the very concept of training is alien to the Freeza Force.
</li><li> Cell is an interesting example. While he has all of the skills of his DNA material, he prefers to build up his power by devouring others and extracting their hard-earned power for himself. All of his major power boosts come from the life forces he consumed, unlike the Saiyans who became stronger through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>. Filler shows him training for the first time during his wait for the Cell Games to start.
</li><li> Fat Buu who is a near endless well of power, endurance, and is able to regenerate. He is also the least skilled of all the Buu forms. He can't even sense energy and gets his ass beaten when fighting someone near or above his power such as Evil Buu, Kid Buu, and Super Saiyan 3 Goku.
</li><li> Super Buu is an interesting case. Although he can sense energy unlike Fat Buu, his fighting style is very crude and like Fat Buu he relies on his ability to regenerate to get ahead. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> this trope later after he absorbs Gotenks, Gohan, and Piccolo, not only gaining their powers, but also their skills and fighting experience. While Piccolo is the least dangerous of the group, he's a brilliant tactician and thus his absorption is what really turns the tide.
</li><li> Kid Buu plays with this trope. While his overall power compared to Super Buu is a debate that rages on to this day, he's a mindless, savage brute and fights like one. However, he is considered the <em>most dangerous</em> because he is completely unpredictable and unhinged, meaning he is one of the few fighters who benefits from this. Furthermore, he does subvert the "unskilled" part in some degree in that he is the most skilled at utilizing the unique rubbery and stretchy properties of his body (makes sense, given he is in his pure natural form.)
</li><li> The original version of Legendary Super Saiyan Broly is a subversion. He really is quite skilled, but he's so strong, he doesn't even bother showing it. Still, during his fights he often shows off complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs">wrestling moves</a>. The rebooted version shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> plays this a little straighter. While he has received some training from his (much, much weaker) father Paragus, most of his experience is against giant monsters and animals; he has almost no experience fighting other <em>people</em>, especially people who can approach his level of strength. When he faces foes who can match his raw power (Vegeta at first, Whis, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gogeta</span>), he gets clobbered.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, out of all seven Shadow Dragons, only Eis, Nuova, and Syn/Omega possess fighting skills that pose a legitimate threat to Goku and the Z Fighters; the other four rely more on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> and trickery to fight them.
</li><li> Freeza is one of the few villains who knows how to raise and lower his power level, but lacks knowledge on how to sense ki without a scouter. In addition, Freeza has spent so much time toying with opponents far weaker than him that he never learned how to stand up in a protracted battle against someone of roughly equal strength. Once raw power proves not to be enough, it is only a matter of time before the more highly trained (and now more powerful) Goku defeats him.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>. By his own admission, Freeza was such a prodigy that he never bothered to train because he figured no one could match his strength. But after getting killed and resurrected and then being told that Goku defeated Majin Buu (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">one of the two beings his father told him never to cross</a>), he realizes that if a Saiyan monkey could achieve such power through hard work and skill, then so could he. So, he finally decides to train for the first time in his life and in just four months achieves a level of power bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He loses again because of his overconfidence; his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode">Golden Super Mode</a> is certainly powerful, but it burns through his stamina at an incredible rate. If he'd kept training to overcome that flaw rather than rushing to Earth the moment he unlocked it, he would have been far stronger than even Goku and would have been able to defeat them all easily.</span>
</li><li> It's downplayed in the Resurrection F arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, where Frieza can fully control his power in his true form, sense power levels, and even control his power in his Golden state. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He still burns Ki at an accelerated rate, and after admittedly lasting a bit longer than in the film he loses power after going all out for only about a minute. However, as of the Universal Survival Saga, this trope has <em>finally</em> been averted. He tells Goku that after his last defeat, he spent his time in Hell meditating and concentrating on killing Goku in the most brutal ways possible and as a result, has managed to gain perfect control over his ki, allowing him to maintain his Golden form indefinitely.</span>
</li><li> Freeza plays with this trope so much he simultaneously created <em>and</em> inverted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Bishōnen Line</a>: Freeza was born with so much raw power <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0j6fc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0j6fc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0j6fc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">his official Power Level is 120 <strong>Million</strong>, in an era when 5 <strong>Thousand</strong> was terrifyingly powerful</span> but so little skill at controlling it that he was forced to create multiple different forms to serve as varying levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a>. In contrast to your standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Bishōnen Line</a> character, Freeza spends most of his time in his <em>most</em> transformed state, and each form after that is him dialing down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">Willfully Weak</a> button, until he returns to his true form.
</li><li> While Future Zamasu does possess enough power to fight against Blue Goku, he heavily relies on his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> to either serve as a meat shield for Black Goku or take advantage of his immortality in conjunction with Black's attacks. However, due to being overconfident with his immortality, he is very easily caught off-guard such as either being backhanded or being sealed away with the Mafuba wave.
</li><li> The worst of them all, however, is Spopovich, who, thanks to Babidi giving him a power-up, is far stronger than baseline humans, can manipulate ki well enough to fly and fire ki blasts and quickly recovers from any damage normal humans and people with low ki power inflicts him... But aside for that his technique is far worse than any of Frieza's soldiers, and the weaker but much more skilled Videl knocks him down <em>seven times</em> before growing too tired to fight effectively while holding back enough to not kill him. In fact he's so bad that Goku and the others realize something's strange is happening, as someone <em>that</em> unskilled could have never got so strong.
</li></ul></li><li> On the heroes' side:
<ul><li> This is also Piccolo's reasoning for training Gohan after witnessing Gohan's hidden power firsthand against Raditz. Although, even as an adult Gohan still fits this trope. He is very powerful and has the ability to become the strongest fighter in the universe. However, he rarely trains, at least not to the extent of the other characters, to unlock his power. He twice gets powered up by having them unlocked for him. Because of this, Gohan does not use many techniques and is prone to bull charges, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a>, or falling for tricks by crafty fighters. He beats his opponents by overwhelming them with pure power and tends to do poorly against opponents who are equal or more powerful than him. This is a particularly bad problem in the Buu Arc, as Gohan hasn't been in a real fight for a good seven years and is severely rusty when he has to fight Dabura, whom 11-year-old Gohan would likely have demolished. A big part of the problem is that unlike most of the strong characters in the series, Gohan <em>dislikes</em> fighting. For the most part he only gets serious when he's really angry, and his anger is not conducive to good tactics.
</li><li> Goten in his early appearances. He has yet to learn how to fly (considered a very basic technique in DBZ) but is able to turn into a Super Saiyan. Gohan compares it to learning how to run before you can crawl.
</li><li> Goku and Krillin are like this for a while at first, as Roshi's general idea for his students is to boost all their raw physical and mental abilities through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> without ever <em>fighting</em> anyone, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">let them figure out technique on their own.</a> Before the preliminaries of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>, Krillin is worried that doing nothing but menial tasks for months hasn't prepared them at all, only for Goku to figure out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">they have to hold back to avoid killing someone by accident.</a> In fact, they were so beyond Roshi's expectation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had to enter the tournament in disguise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALessonInDefeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALessonInDefeat">to make sure they didn't win through brute force and get complacent</a></span>.
</li><li> Mr. Popo accuses Goku of this in the original series. As he puts it, Goku has a lot of power but makes very poor use of it by doing wasteful movements, wasting energy, and using his eyes too much.
</li><li> Although Future Trunks is disciplined and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>, since he didn't have anybody to train him after Future Gohan died, he doesn't have a full grasp of fundamental fighting concepts. Cell mocks him for relying on brute force and for not noticing the flaw of the Ultra Super Saiyan form (it increases strength but decreases speed and stamina, making it almost useless against an equal or superior fighter). Goku notices the flaw as soon as he achieves the form and so declines to use it. To quote Goku, "What good is strength if I can't catch my opponent?" Vegeta also immediately notices the flaw, and, until mastering the basic Super Saiyan form, relies on the Ascended Super Saiyan one that only bulks him up enough to increase his speed too, if not increasing the strength to the same level of the Ultra form.
</li><li> Goku averts this trope throughout the series after he's grown up. While he does possess many qualities of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a>, his idiocy is usually portrayed in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">tendency to show mercy to his enemies</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">ignorance of civilized lifestyles</a>. When fighting against truly dangerous opponents, Goku's focus and fighting form are top notch, a fact that many of his companions notice. He even says himself during the Otherworld Tournament that his skill in combat is directly proportional to the seriousness of the threat he's facing.
</li></ul></li><li> Zeno-sama also seems to fall into this category. While it's stated that he never actually fights (and probably doesn't really know how to), he's still the strongest since he can wipe out anything or anything he wants with a thought.
</li><li> When selecting potential team members for the multi-universe Tournament of Power, Goku and Gohan immediately disqualify Goten and Trunks from being involved. The format of the tournament is an eighty-combatant battle royal with ring-outs as the only accepted way to remove an opponent. This situation better favors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> combatants like Krillin and Master Roshi. For all their power, Goten and Trunks are too inexperienced and straightforward as fighters to do much good in that situation.
</li><li> Kefla, the fusion of Caulifla and Kale possesses a tremendous amount of power owing to their combined powers along with a Potara Fusion, which easily makes her the strongest fighter of Universe 6, even more so than Hit. However, she is shown to demonstrate very little control over her powers, as she often wastes her powers using impractical huge energy blasts and she couldn't even learn how to control her speed. Super Saiyan Blue Goku is even capable of fighting evenly with her with the latter only able to gain the upper hand due to Goku being weakened over his previous confrontation earlier. This perhaps demonstrated when Goku reattains his Ultra Instinct where even though her blasts are said to be able to vaporize him if it hits, Goku is easily able to dodge each and every single one of them before ultimately eliminating her with a Kamehameha straight to her face.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, Shizuo Heiwajima's typical fighting style is described as the real-life equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing">Button Mashing</a>. Given that he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">bench-press a van</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">deflect or occasionally break a blade on his skin</a> in a series that otherwise has normal human-level power, this is just about all he needs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Gao only started playing football that season, yet he's already one of the best linemen in Japan. Why? Because he can bench press 440+ pounds and flings opponents away like nothing. People even nickname him things like "caveman", "dinosaur", "monster", and "muscle brains." His lack of technique, however, is a conscious choice since he wants to find someone who equals him in strength. When he finally does meet someone who overpowers him, he quickly starts improving on technique.

<ul><li> Many young heroes in the <em>Gundam</em> series are notably less skilled than their more experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> adversaries, but manage to survive due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a>. Generally, though, they survive enough battles through the series to become experienced and an ace in their own right. In the original series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, Amuro Ray at his second sortie gets his ass handed to him by Char, whose Zaku II is extremely inferior but has earned his fame as Zeon's most formidable pilot by being just that good and has only improved since. After Char is pulled away from the frontlines, Amuro, who by this point has been piloting the Gundam for roughly a month and a half, manages to defeat Ramba Ral, a veteran soldier who's been piloting a mobile suit <em>before they were first introduced to the battlefield four years ago</em> (he was one of the test pilots through their whole development) thanks to his machine's superiority over Ral's Gouf. Ral praises Amuro, but tells him not to get cocky, since it was the Gundam's power and not his own skill that won the day; Amuro just calls him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">Sore Loser</a>.
</li><li> Oftentimes the main characters are psychic as well, which of course is a huge boon in combat. There's still a matter of Skill vs Power there, though: some rely so heavily on their psychic abilities that they have little conventional skill. And it has been shown that sufficiently skilled non-psychics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">can beat a psychic</a> in combat in this franchise.

While his other fellow Meisters are or grow into skilled pilots, Tieria himself never really gets much better. However all of his Gundam's have 3 or more massive particle beam weapons and a energy shield to protect him, AND a secret hidden mode to surprise his opponents with. He doesn't need skill when he can simply blow his enemies away from long range, while safe inside his barrier, and if for some reason they do get to him and his shield fails he surprises them by switching modes. The main character Setsuna is also like this at first, relying on his powerful Gundam to offset his rather poor piloting skills, but as the tech gap decreases he comes into his own as an extremely skilled pilot. The Trinity Siblings meanwhile never improve <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because they were designed that way, so when their job was complete they'd be easy prey for the skilled pilots with equally good weapons sent after them</span>.

He doesn't have the limits of the textbook boxing techniques and, combined with naturally insane power, speed and reflexes, become completely unpredictable. His fighting style is even described by his trainer as not being boxing but "simply violence." Takamura spends the first half of their fight trying to prove that boxing skill <em>is</em> of use. It is eventually played straight when Hawks trainer learns how very superior Takamura is through having learned the proper technique and how much of a backbone Brian Hawk lacks because of his lack of proper training.
</li><li> Inspired by Takamura, Brian Hawk's trainer eventually finds another similar prospect in a 17 year old kid by the name of Woli, who as a result of grown up on a tropical island and spending his days climbing and jumping through trees with monkeys, is an unbelievable athlete. At the time of his match with Ippo, Woli <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was the Indonesian national champion, despite having only fought 3 matches total in his life.</span> Despite being obviously green <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to the point that he wasn't used to holding a "proper" boxing stance</span>, Woli gives Ippo fits and nearly beats him on sheer natural talent alone.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ippo only wins on a miracle comeback because Ippo used tactics Woli had never fought against.

However, the one who trained him emphasized improving his random style rather than fixing it with the intent of making Berserker turn his way of fighting into his own "self-taught style."

When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryuko embraces her Life Fiber powers and regains both Scissor Blades</span>, Nui gets knocked a peg down and suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>.
</li><li> Ryuko also started out as this. There are few better ways to describe someone wearing a 100% Life Fiber uniform that some subs translate as a "Godrobe," (which, by the way, is probably not an exaggeration) but struggles against people wearing 20% Life Fiber. This also extends to the fact that she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>: In spite of her high offense and speed as a result of being a Life Fibers-enhanced human on top of wearing a 100% Life Fiber uniform, she takes hits from three-star Goku Uniforms users (which are considerably weaker than a Kamui, which is equivalent to a 10-star Goku Uniform) because the latter are far better skilled with their uniforms. She and Senketsu get better, though. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">Lord,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">do they</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">get better.</a> Especially after consuming all that Life Fiber.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Buffaloman was not a great fighter at all until he made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> and gained his ten million Choujin Power. With it he can overpower any opponent he faces and even put out enough power to reverse the Kinniku Buster.
</li><li> Kinnikuman himself is this, to an extent. Part of the reason why he started out as such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">awful superhero</a>, besides his cowardice and stupidity, was that he was so goddamn clumsy; one time, while going giant, he tripped over a car like a roller skate and landed face first in a subway entrance. Even after he learns how to wrestle, he starts to prefer power moves over techniques, spending most of his fights setting up opponents to be put into one of his heavy finishers. This is eventually called out during his fight against Kinnikuman Super Phoenix during the Scramble For The Throne arc.
</li><li> The Perfect Choujin Peek-A-Boo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a> with the mentality of an infant. However, precisely because of this, Peek-A-Boo can learn frighteningly fast and dominates his fight with Kinnikuman by learning and assimilating all the power moves Kinnikuman favors. Kinnikuman learns the secret to defeating him lies in the use of basic, foundational moves like body slams and kicks. This works because Peek-A-Boo grew <em>too</em> fast, and has none of those basics himself. Kinnikuman wins the fight by breaking out the Fuurinkazan, a combo of multiple basic techniques he hasn't used in a fight since the early days of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Shurato Hidaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegendOfHeavenlySphereShurato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegendOfHeavenlySphereShurato">Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato</a></em> has lots of raw power but lacks the proper training, as he was trained in martial arts on Earth but that doesn't exactly help him to control his Sohma.
</li><li> Kouichi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LinebarrelsOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LinebarrelsOfIron">Linebarrels of Iron</a></em> is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">at first</a>; most of his early victories are entirely due to Linebarrel being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, and he causes extreme amounts of collateral damage from inexperience. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Reiji</a> points all of this out when <em>he hands Kouichi his ass</em> in the fourth episode of the anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Nanoha Takamachi has a lot of raw power, but her technique isn't quite up to the task at the very beginning. Later on though, she trains and refines her technique so immensely that it almost becomes an inversion. She learns <em>fast</em> and she does it <em>good</em>.
</li><li> Applies to Fate to some degree, too, as Precia had Linith skip over certain aspects of her training while teaching her how to fight in order to get her ready to search for the Jewel Seeds soon enough. While observing Fate and Nanoha's battle in Episode 7, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Chrono</a> notes that both of them are mainly throwing around powerful attacks with less regard to using the best one for the situation.
</li><li> Precia herself has an incredible amount of raw magical power (she was able to cripple a spaceship in another dimension, and is one of only 2 identified SS-rank mages in the franchise) but lacks actual combat experience, which is probably why she mostly stays hidden and makes Fate do the work.
</li><li> Hayate is this down to the core. Her magical power is by far the highest in the entire TSAB (she's the other known SS-rank mage) and her attacks are equal to <em>nukes</em>. And yet she's - at least in the main continuity, as opposed to the <em>Battle of Aces</em> one - helplessly unskilled and needs support to even aim her attacks properly. As she says <em>herself</em>, this is why she would lose to almost everyone else in the main cast, despite being theoretically the strongest mage alive.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Hückebein Family</a> from <em>Force</em> would seem to be this by design. Their powers allow them to kill mages with barely any effort on their part, and without any harm to boot, but none of them apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Curren</a> initially show any tactics beyond simple brute force. This makes sense, since they have no real interest in learning how to fight when the virus that will kill them if they don't kill other people doesn't differentiate between a talented fighter and a civilian. Then enemies show up who they can't simply overpower, making them have to work for their victories.
</li><li> As Chrono states in the first season, raw magical power doesn't equate to being a top tier mage. This point is made clear in a supplementary manga, where Nanoha and Fate, both AAA class mages, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">both badly lose a training battle against an admiral whose power level is two levels below them.</a>
</li><li> Vivio shows the other end of the spectrum in that enough raw power can overcome any amount of skill. When she was first introduced, she was a six year old girl who hasn't had a day of combat training, formal or otherwise. With nothing more than brute strength, she managed to take on the best aerial combat mage in the entire TSAB utilizing the latest in military hardware. And she probably would have won if she had actually wanted to.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1l1to');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1l1to" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1l1to');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Vivio's mage rank has never been specified, but fans generally presume that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Sankt Kaiser</a> form was SSS, the highest possible rank.</span>
</li><li> Rinne in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em> is another example. She was born with an extraordinary amount of talent but her fighting style is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>. Normally, this enough to let her steamroll through any opponent, but she ended up losing to Vivio (who had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> due to injuries sustained at the end of <em>StrikerS</em>).

As a Magi, Aladdin has a massive supply of Magoi, but next to no idea how to use it other than instinctively shielding himself. Alibaba had a incredibly powerful Djinn Metal Vessel but ran into problems with focusing and truly utilizing that power like most Metal Vessel users could. They both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">grow out of it.</a>

<ul><li> In an unusual example, Negi's father Nagi Springfield, known as the 'Thousand Master' for supposedly mastering a thousand spells, is revealed to be a heroic, magical version of this. In truth, he only knows something like 5-6 spells by heart, and has to perform anything more complicated than the bare-bone basics from a tome - but he backs those spells up with a <em>ludicrous</em> amount of raw magical power (and a bit of mundane trickery).
</li><li> Jack Rakan is thought to be this by many people, and at first glance he doesn't appear to do anything more than just hit things really hard. However, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>: he's <em>very</em> skilled on top of all his raw power, he just doesn't see much need to use his skills unless his opponent is strong enough to warrant it.

This is then doubled down on when his owner, Spyke, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">chooses to give him a more powerful DOG-type chassis instead of a close combat chassis</a> for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a>; as Krosserdog, his stats are all boosted high enough that his accuracy is much improved... but anybody familiar with a normal Krosserdog can still see his shooting is far less effective than normal.
</li><li> Munakata Kei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> possesses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> of a whole variety of weapons (katana, grenades, guns, hammers). However, he lacks any actual skill at handling his weapons, and tosses aside any that don't finish the job. Zenkichi manages to counter almost all his weapons because of this, though is severely tired out by the process. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The purpose of all those weapons is actually to make Munakata weaker, since in hand-to-hand combat just one hit from him would be fatal and he doesn't want to kill anybody.</span>
</li><li> Mangaka ONE seems to enjoy this trope, as just like Saitama above, Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100">Mob Psycho 100</a></em> may not train in inventive uses of psychic techniques, like some of his adversaries, but his raw psychic power is so immeasurable that he doesn't need to be inventive most of the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shoto Todoroki is the most naturally powerful quirk user enrolled in UA, disregarding Izuku who is less likely to match Shoto at a recent time due to having a quirk customed made and newly formed to grow over time or adapted to the user through practice. Shoto is a born genetic freak engrained with his father and mother's potential for surpassing the best of the best. But as such, Shoto's been hammered as a child to just spam alot of ice and fire without being encouraged to micromanage practical skills in controlling his quirk, thus sadly becomes more prone to be outperformed and overcome in pure skill from highly skilled students of his tier.
</li><li> Izuku Midoriya plays with this trope. One aspect of Izuku Midoriya's quirk is a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> power, however he can use it to blow away his opponent just by flicking his finger. Unfortunately, the strain of the power causes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">bones to shatter,</a> and before he became more used to it (and thus able to set it to levels other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">0% and 100%</a>), every fight ended with him in much worse shape than his opponent, even when he won. Even after he learns to use less of the power to keep his bones from breaking, he can still only overpower his opponents with superior strength and speed. A large aspect is because Izuku still has trouble accepting the Quirk One-For-All as a part of himself. On the other hand, Izuku knows quite well how to fight <em>without</em> using his quirk, since he went most of his life without having it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">All Might</a> averts this trope. While his appearance and quirk gives the impression of only Super Strength, Super Speed and Super Toughness, he combines the raw power with his keen tactical sense and refined punch techniques. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later chapters however reveal that One For All also contains the Quirks of the previous holders, but All Might never figured out how to access them, only using the physical abilities to their full potential.</span>
</li><li> The show also gives us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">All For One</a>. His eponymous Quirk allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite">steal the Quirks of others</a> which he can then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">combine to form devastating attacks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">that can lay waste to several city blocks</a> as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">take out several Pro Heroes in a single instant</a> and is physically strong enough to hold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">All</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Might</a> at bay with his bare hands despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">needing a mobile life support system</a>. <em>Unlike</em> All Might, who trained for years to master his One For All Quirk, All For One isn't a refined fighter and his "fighting style" basically boils down to "mash together a bunch of powerful Quirks, blast the enemy and hope they're dead". He even cites this trope as the reason why he doesn't want Best Jeanist's Fiber Master Quirk as such a powerful Quirk would require years of practice to master.
</li><li> Dabi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBurningHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsBurningHot">Cremation</a> Quirk is extremely powerful - he can incinerate opponents, knock heavy vehicles off the road and start a raging forest fire with a flick of his fingers, but his technique pretty much boils down to "spam everything with really hot fire until it's ashes" (though granted, he hasn't been in many situations where this hasn't worked in his favour) and he can't use his flames continuously or he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">starts to cook from the inside out</a>.</em>
</li><li> In a similar manner to Dabi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon">Overhaul's</a> fighting style is pretty much to keep using his quirk until whatever is in his way is nothing but a bloody pulp and once you manage to get close enough to him he has virtually no hand-to-hand combat skills, though good luck actually doing that if you're not a main character, because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">Overhaul Quirk</a> is insanely powerful and he can use it on both organic and inorganic matter and use it constantly without suffering much in the way of physical drawbacks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character is described as this before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> by Jiraiya. As he explains when he becomes Naruto's mentor, Naruto possesses such a large reserve of chakra (thanks to being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Nine-Tailed Fox's container</a>) that he can more readily rely on raw-power ninjutsu instead of the more fine-control techniques his peers have learned.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that although his fighting skills start off as unrefined (though he improves tremendously throughout the series), he was already quite clever in <em>how</em> he used his abilities, with his victories as much a result of good tactics as sheer determination.
</li><li> His initial improvement after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> may to some seem like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>, but he was already using his jutsus more intelligently, largely outgrowing the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">rushing</a> enemies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">dozens of clones</a> (aside from when using a clone rush as a distraction from his real attack) in favor of more creative uses, such as creating one to redirect himself in the air. As he improves even more over the second half of the series (particularly with regards to techniques requiring fine control), he grows able to use powerful jutsus to their full potentials, instead of simply throwing in enough power to compensate for lack of skill, becoming one of the most powerful ninja in the world (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">though still a Genin in rank</a>). The reason his improvement may seem informed is that he keeps losing his temper and charging at the enemy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Bijuu-mode</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Besides ninja, there's the tailed beasts themselves: they have immense power, but being monsters they can't do much with it besides thrash around and shoot out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">giant balls of chakra.</a> It's for this reason that beasts with a host are stated to be potentially more dangerous.
</li><li> A heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> variant occurs with Hashirama Senju, the first Hokage. Hashirama was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">a very skilled, trained shinobi</a>, but strictly <em>in comparison to his succeeding Hokage</em>, he was this: His raw Chakra reserves surpassed all of them, even his own brother, and he mainly used his extremely powerful Wood-style Kekkei Genkei (a bloodline mutation rather than a taught shinobi art) in combat, whereas all the others had to develop/refine a wide variety of unique, powerful techniques to compare to him. Minato, the fourth Hokage, neatly contrasts him as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> compared to the other Hokage; while Minato was powerful to even an elite Ninja's standard, he in comparison to Hashirama mainly relied on finesse, speed, and teleportation jutsus to compensate for a lack of humongous chakra power.
</li><li> The 4th Raikage is this; He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with some wrestling moves, but basically uses a combination of speed and strength to overpower his opponents. While he was able to toss Uchiha Sasuke around like a rag doll, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">headlong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">assault strategy</a> costs him his arm, and had Gaara not interfered, possibly worse. When up against opponents who can match or surpass his speed and strength, such as the 4th Hokage or Madara Uchiha, he comes off as lacking.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaguya Ōtsutsuki</span>, is this in spades. Despite having more chakra than even the <em>Ten-Tails</em>, she barely knows how to fight, and she doesn't know how to strategize, coming off as a child when dealing with weaker opponents. Naruto gets the better of her several times over and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slices her arm off</span> due to her inability to recognize feints and basic tricks.

Also, his attacks are powerful enough to overwhelm any attempt to block.
</li><li> At that same time, he has the same level of Haki that Hancock does, but can't control it and can't do anything more than render people without sufficient force of will unconscious. Luffy's shown occasional flashes of other types of Haki use (against Mihawk, he avoided losing a hand because he saw a flash of what Mihawk's next attack would be), but they too were uncontrolled and he didn't even seem to realize what had happened. After training with Silvers Rayleigh, this has now changed as he's become both skilled <em>and</em> strong.
</li></ul></li><li> Zoro was also this to an extent in the earlier parts of the storyline, his idea of sword fighting being "Swing your swords at your opponent really, <em>really</em> hard until they stop moving". With his absurd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>, this worked pretty well... until he faced off against Dracule Mihawk, the greatest swordsman in the world. He kept Zoro at bay with a blade smaller than a pocketknife, and the only reason Zoro survived the fight was that he had enough willpower and spirit to earn Mihawk's respect. Zoroe started to focus more on technique from then onwards, and began in earnest when he fought a guy with steel-hard skin who was basically immune to brute force.
</li><li> Of the Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> villains, Hody Jones gets accused of this by Jimbei, who effortlessly blocks a powerful attack from him. He's also proven to be absolutely <em>no</em> match for Luffy whatsoever when they finally begin to throw down. Rather than making any effort to improve his technique, Hody instead artificially boosts his strength with Energy Steroids, which still isn't enough.
</li><li> This apparently tends to apply to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Logia users</a>. In the Grand Line and weaker seas, very few people can use Haki so most Logia users easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> every attack. In the New World however, Haki is apparently fairly common so "Logia users convinced of their invincibility are the first to go."
</li><li> Caesar Clown is an interesting combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>; His Gas Gas powers give him a plethora of mean abilities, such as sucking away oxygen, poisoning people, and causing explosions. However, he's a scientist, not a fighter, so in battle his first and only responses are to use any one of those skills to overwhelm his opponent. When up against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> like Luffy, he goes down pretty quickly.
</li><li> The Don Quixote Pirates have two officers that are this; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Machvise</a> likes to crush people with his weight, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">Dellinger</a> blitzes his opponents with his speed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Machvise ends up being punched into the atmosphere when the giant warrior Hajrudin summons enough strength to match his force, and Dellinger goes down in one hit when up against the impossible speed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Hakuba.</a> </span>
</li><li> Kyros has no background in combat training, having grown up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> around Dressrosa, yet was able to curb-stomp the soldiers and guards sent in to arrest him. This display of talent attracted the attention of the king of Dressrosa, who offered him a job as a fighter in the Colosseum. Kyros then proceeded to have an undefeated career in the Colosseum, with increasingly strong opponents due to his ever-growing reputation and celebrity status. He only ever suffered one injury, which was outside the Colosseum, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ambush set by Donquixote Doflamingo, some invisible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">Razor Floss</a> that sliced off one of his feet and was subsequently turned into a toy during his quick moment of surprise. Kyros did not let this stop him though—even as a toy soldier, he rebuilt his image as a fearsome fighter, and until Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates arrived on Dressrosa, was the single biggest source of problems for Doflamingo and his criminal network</span>.
</li><li> Big Mom, one of the Four Emperors, was born Charlotte Linlin, a natural force of destruction who was taking down full-grown giant warriors at the age of 6 <em>by complete accident.</em> She never had to train for any amount of her freakish might, and only got even more dangerous after gaining a Devil Fruit power that gave her the ability to snatch somebody's soul right out of their body. As a result, in the present day she has no need for much technique or skill at all, as her raw power is more than enough; even after all these years she still swings swords like baseball bats and doesn't really punch so much as she swats things like flies, but that's more than enough.
</li><li> Fleet Admiral Sakazuki. Most of his techniques boil down to either 'spam magma fists' or '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPunch">turn fist into magma and punch until target is dead</a>', but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">raw strength</a> and the fact he's made of magma are enough for him to obliterate all but the strongest of foes in a few hits.
</li></ul></li><li> Saitama from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> personally invokes this. He's so powerful compared everyone else that he doesn't need any skills. The only thing he has really done is punch people, and move around. But when your opponent can move around so fast his afterimage is a solid object, and when he can punch so hard he can shoot down an orbiting alien spaceship while standing on the <em>surface</em>, there ain't any sort of technique that can help you against something like that.
<ul><li> Of course, him not <em>needing</em> to use skill isn't the same as not having it - later on it becomes apparent Saitama must have a great deal of control behind his strength, such as when he managed to destroy an entire cliff-face behind Genos during their spar while leaving Genos completely unharmed. That said, his fighting style is, in and of itself, pretty straightforward, and he turns down learning a martial arts style from fellow hero Bang because he doesn't need technique with his level of strength. He also doesn't <em>want</em> to become more skilled because most of his fights are already too easy as it is, and he desperately wishes he could fight somebody able to give him a real challenge.
</li><li> This seems like it comes back to bite him when he takes on Garou, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who not only has incredible martial arts skills but the speed and strength to make them count for something. At one point, although he admits Saitama is faster than him, Garou manages to get the upper hand by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">predicting his moves in advance</a>. This is, notably, the first time in the entire series when someone has dodged his punches, and even Saitama is surprised. However, once Saitama gets more serious, the sheer difference in strength, speed and durability are still far too much for Garou to overcome</span>.

<ul><li> Lt. Surge's Raichu in the anime falls into this. Surge's belief that only fully evolved Pokémon were worthwhile caused him to turn his Pikachu into a Raichu immediately. This Raichu lacks the techniques he would've learned only as a Pikachu and thus relies on his immense power to win; the minute Ash and co. realize this, they adapt their strategy to exploit Pikachu's natural speed and agility, allowing Pikachu to win the rematch.
</li><li> Many fully evolved Pokemon have this problem. Being larger and stronger makes it harder for them to use their old skills and less incentive to learn new ones. Among the teams of the heroes, the ones hit the hardest by this are Ash's Charizard and Iris's Dragonite. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the two battle, Charizard has the upper hand because he's expanded his moveset, increased in strength since evolving and Iris misread Charizard's type.</span>
</li><li> When Ash's Pikachu first Gigantamaxes in the 2019 series, he's clearly not used to his sheer bulk and can't use his speed due to it. However, his Max Moves still pack a punch.

</li><li> Kaidoh Kaoru fits to a lesser extent. While he is a strong tennis player, most of his techniques merely revolve around variations of his signature technique "Snake" (until the nationals arc, he possessed only two; the rest were developed through Inui's guidance). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">he is extremely tenacious</a>, able to hold his own against the much more skilled and violent Kirihara.

This is justified by his incredibly powerful yet unstable PSI Melchese Door relying more on emotion. Though he quickly has to overcome it due to the toll it takes on his mind.

<ul><li> Sanosuke definitely fits this trope. Unlike many of the characters in the series, his fighting abilities were derived from being a fighter-for-hire. He lacks any formal fighting style other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a>, making up for it in raw power and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>. This is deconstructed in a fight with Saito; He proves to be just as powerful as Sanosuke if not more so, but has learned basic skills like defense. This allows him to pummel Sano with ease while avoiding damage. Further to note, Sanosuke had a badly injured shoulder at the time of the fight. Saito won without ever laying a punch near that shoulder just to show how powerful a <em>skilled and strong</em> fighter can be in fisticuffs. And in his first appearance, Sano fought Kenshin using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Zanbatou</a>, which he had no particular skill in using and nothing to make up for the unwieldy bulk of the giant sword. He was relying entirely on the fact that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">immense strength</a> would allow him to swing such a massive sword in the first place, which had worked out fine in the past against swordsmen who lacked Kenshin's skill and speed. But he couldn't even come close to landing a hit on Kenshin, and afterward Sano relied on his fists instead.
</li><li> To a degree, Shishio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> Soujirou is this. He's stated to have talent that at the very least, equals Kenshin. However, his strategy basically boils down to relying on his superior speed to overwhelm Kenshin. When they fought for the second time, though, Kenshin had completed his Hiten Mitsurugi training, giving him a technique fast enough to match Soujirou, which meant it went down to power; Kenshin won because his stroke had more force, breaking Soujirou's blade.* Rin, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em> episode three onwards, can sling around some pretty impressive pyrotechnics.

<ul><li> Hanamichi Sakuragi is incredibly tall for his early age and has huge physical strength as well as almost animalistic reflexes and jump abilities, but his raw power is paired with a complete lack of experience and skill.

</li><li> While Dark Marik is by no means a <em>bad</em> duelist, his main dueling strategy relies on two things: The magic of his Shadow Games and the Winged Dragon of Ra. In all of his duels, Marik is on the cusp of defeat only for him to summon the Winged Dragon of Ra and win (not helped by it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">pulling out a new ability each time</a>). In the four-way duel between him, Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey, he is the first one eliminated due to him not having access to Ra or his Shadow Games. And in his later duel with Joey, he only won because the latter passed out from the life-draining effects of the Shadow Game before he could deal the finishing blow. He would have been defeated in his first match, if Mai didn't try to use Ra to finish him (not knowing it required to recite a summoning phrase written in a dead language to unlock it).

Press-ganged into becoming a gladiator, Hulk is forced to develop sufficient skills to survive and claw his way to the top. As a result, by the time the arc ends Hulk has not only gained some combat skills but is even <em>stronger</em> and smarter than he was before.

<ul><li> Superman is often subject to this. Other writers recall just <em>how much time</em> he has spent fighting other superpowered beings as strong or even stronger than he is, and decided he would probably be long dead if he charged at them all the time. This was spelled out with a fight between Superman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Ultraman</a>, where Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">squashed</a> him because Ultraman's method of killing his enemies as soon as he could (as well as presumably sending out his minions) meant that he got very little practice fighting beings on his level.
</li><li> Also Batman taught him some martial arts. And Ali gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">Boxing Lessons for Superman</a>.
</li><li> Many of his enemies who face him with brute force usually fight like this, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SolomonGrundy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SolomonGrundy">Solomon Grundy</a> and Doomsday.
</li><li> Despite popular belief, Superman is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>... when writers remember that he's actually an expert combatant, having been trained by some of the greatest martial artists and warriors in the DCU<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note262oc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note262oc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note262oc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Wildcat or Mongul</span>. There's a number of stories in which he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower">depowered</a> or had to fight foes as powerful or more powerful than him and proved to be a masterful fighter, beating his opponents based on his fighting skills alone. He just "conveniently" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">tends to forget his skills</a> when writers have him fight less powerful superheroes, as their fights would end much sooner if he didn't. It doesn't help that he rarely has a chance or need to display said skills, given how powerful he is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">leading many writers and fans to the assumption that he's this trope</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> is often subject to this. Usually, several veteran heroes help her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">take a level in badass</a> (her cousin shows her how to use her powers, Batman and even Wonder Woman teach her how to fight without them) so she is not helpless if she cannot resort to her super-powers.

</li></ul></li><li> During the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em>, <em>KnightsEnd</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Azrael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Azrael">Azrael</a> is this towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> Bruce Wayne and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> — Azbats is outfitted with a suit of armor that is built more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and relies heavily on it. Bruce is able to slap Azbats around using things against him and the only reason Nightwing lost to him was that he got caught off-guard by a lady refusing to leave the slots on a casino boat.
</li><li> Most of the Gauls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> have shades of this, but Obelix is the only <em>true</em> example. Due to being permanently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">superpowered</a>, he hasn't even had the benefit of unpowered combat training the others had. This is demonstrated abundantly in the movie <em>The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</em>, where one of the trials pits him and Obelix against a Germanic Judo-master. Obelix's attempts to smash through him with brute force are effortlessly redirected, and he quickly proves entirely unable to hurt the little man. Fortunately, Asterix is there to effectively <em>talk</em> the man into submission... or, rather, distract him with talk and an interest in the man's fighting style that gets the poor German to give Asterix instructions and allow himself to be used as a training dummy, realising he's helped Asterix subdue him only after having his arms and legs tied into knots.

Super high stats in everything but weapon Skill. He doesn't seem to have much technique other than draining the enemy to death, but when you eat planets...
<ul><li> Marvel handbooks give most cosmic beings like Eternity or Death maximal stats at everything except fighting skills. When you're omnipotent you don't really need skill.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, when Peter complains that he's been just getting by on luck and his natural strength and speed, so Mary Jane suggests he take martial arts. In the first 100 comics of the series, there's a surprising number of times where he actually gets the crap kicked out of him.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> indicates that Peter was in fact <em>very</em> skilled at using his powers and at fighting, especially towards the latter half of his career. It's specified that his successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> is drawn much clumsier in order to contrast the two.
</li><li> Miles himself is also a subversion; the above would imply that Miles is this, but it's made clear early on that between the two, despite being smaller and younger, it is Miles who is the soldier and the fighter. As such, while he appears to be clumsier and unrefined, Miles has proven to be very good at taking down multiple threats simultaneously and combining strength, speed, webs, and agility to overwhelm gross odds. As such, his poor form doesn't stop him from being skilled. Keeping in mind that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> appears to be atrophied, so he has to rely less on instinct than the average Spider-Man.
</li><li> Over on Earth-65, there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em>, where it's made incredibly clear that her spider-powers are the main (if not only) thing keeping her afloat in any given skirmish. She can mop the floor with your average mook, but whenever she has to fight someone who is just as strong and/or has actually trained in combat, she struggles to hold her own. One character notes that even if he could go back in time to train every prior generation of her family in the art of fighting, she'd still be useless without her powers.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable">The Plutonian</a> often shows himself to be very intelligent and more than able to outwit his foes when finally forced into combat with someone on his level of power he gets his ass kicked as he never needed to learn to fight. Weirdly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig Zagged</a>; in the last issue of his spin-off, Max Damage recounts a story of how he once lured the Plutonian (pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>) into an area that nullified both their powers, assuming this trope would let him win because he had a backstory as a mundane and the Plutonian didn't... only to find that the Plutonian was entirely capable of fighting unpowered, and getting his ass handed to him. Possibly Max is exaggerating for effect, or perhaps he qualifies himself.

She can level mountains but literally lacks the finesse to pick up a dime. Later, Hellion of the New X-Men is shown to be similarly strong but unskilled in the use of his telekinesis.

He's an Omega-level energy manipulator, making him leagues more powerful than his brothers and arguably up there with Phoenix and Onslaught. And yet his actual fighting style isn't anything to write home about and he ends up beaten more often than not by foes with less power but greater control.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RachelSummers">Rachel Summers</a> was this when she first became Phoenix.

So little skill." Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> beat her in a telepathic duel for this exact reason. Fortunately, Rachel was a quick study and is now one of the most skilled telepaths and telekinetics in the Marvel Universe, to the point where in one of the tie-ins to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em> Xavier explicitly warns Wolverine to treat her as if she's Xavier himself.

Offscreen sound effects and dialog indicate she does it several more times, to the amusement of the other heroes. Ninjette later wonders why all super-strong heroes fight like "developmentally-disabled eight-year-olds."
</li><li> This can describe nearly all the supers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBoys">The Boys</a></em>. In general, this is what allows the titular Boys to go toe-to-toe with them, as the supes lack the training to utilize their powers effectively and efficiently. Even then, however, at a certain level, the difference in scale simply becomes too large for the tactical advantage to remain. As the Frenchman puts it, "fighting the Seven is like making war on the sun".
</li><li> Marv from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> doesn't seem to need any fancy martial arts considering he can maul people with his bare hands. This is evident when he goes up against Kevin, the sadistic cannibal who, despite being smaller, is quite the skilled fighter.

</li><li> Prince Swagger in <em>Super Pro K.O</em> is a champion boxer who took up wrestling after the boxing world became too scared to face him. Wrestlers don't like fighting him either — not because he's 375 lbs. of solid muscle, but because he's awkward at best in the ring. His clumsiness and lack of agility cost him his front teeth in a match against rookie junior cruiserweight Joe Somiano.
</li><li> <em>Punch Drunk</em> has detective Mick Brown repeatedly run afoul of a massive criminal strongarm he affectionately dubs "the Big Lug." When things finally get physical between them, Mick notes in narration that big enforcer types like the Lug rarely have much (if any) fighting experience; usually when they hit a guy he's already helpless, and they don't get into fights in the first place because not many people are brave enough to step up to someone their size.

Not helping is the fact that prior to gaining his power, Dimitri was a scientist echidna, not a warrior, so he has no experience in actual fighting. Knuckles, who is a trained fighter, lands several good hits on him, and even points out to him; "All that power and I'm still surprised at what a glass jaw you have!" and; "You may be stronger, but do you even know how to fight?" <br/><br/>For a contrast, Mammoth Mogul, upon stealing Enerjak's power, was definitely more dangerous, specifically because he's had over a millennium to learn and master multiple different forms of combat, and was a match for Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles' super forms simultaneously.

This ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> later as, when bereft of his Spider-Sense and with Shang-Chi's help, he refined his acrobatic reaction-based fighting into a proper martial art called the Way of the Spider, an all-bases covering form to allow him to counter all types of combatants, after which he could be considered one of the Earth's <em>most</em> skilled fighters.
</li><li> With an <em>insanely</em> strong power to control and project electricity, all things considered, Electro should be an Avengers-level villain. The problem is that Electro isn't very smart and has never thought to train himself, thinking he can just bulldoze through everything. The result is that he can't control his powers well enough to use them to their real potential, an issue that has become progressively worse for him the older he gets. One of the few times he actually does, he fights evenly with Nate Grey — then a partial example of this trope (he had the skills, he was just thoroughly impetuous, short-tempered and prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown">Superpower Meltdown</a>) — who was essentially Cable minus the Techno-Organic Virus and dialled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and had beaten seven shades of excrement out of his world's version of Apocalypse before leaving him for Magneto to kill.

Unlike most examples of this trope, even in his early days, he was capable of some remarkably sophisticated uses of his powers, such channelling Earth's magnetic field through his brain with his telekinesis to create a powerful EMP, thanks to tutoring from AoA!Forge, but he was hamstrung by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">short-tempered, impetuous</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">going it alone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">being prone to jumping to the worst possible conclusion</a>, having no idea of the limits of his powers or how to fully control them (some of his more impressive tricks were completely instinctive) and frequently suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown">Superpower Meltdown</a> caused by a genetic flaw designed to kill him by the age of 21. <br/><br/>He learned over the years, and following the Shaman Reboot towards the end of his series, he solved the problem of his genetic flaw and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, treating the multiverse as his personal stepladder, wandering up and down 'the Spiral' of parallel worlds as he pleased and on his return in the <em>Dark X-Men</em> miniseries, showing the ability to step outside of time and thereby see the future (one of three hundred ways he had to do so, according to him), transform himself into energy and back again. He also took on all of the Dark X-Men and Dark Avengers (minus the Sentry, who Osborn reckoned Nate could match in a straight fight) without breaking a sweat while politely critiquing their technique and remarking why each attack wouldn't work. The only one who gave him trouble was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">Ares</a>, and since he was in the midst of executing what would prove to be an almost perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> against Osborn, there was no guarantee that he wasn't just throwing the fight.

Here Devastator goes up against Superion, a Combiner fine-tuned to be in-sync with all sorts of different upgrades to his body and mind. Superion fights very creatively, shifting his body to avoid blows, activating the jets in an arm that Devastator tore off him, so it flies back and starts beating on him, and converting his leg into another arm for a sneak attack. Devastator just pummels Superion into submission and drags his unconscious body away. It takes two Combiners to finally bring him down, and even then Devastator didn't go quietly.

When he puts his mind to it he is a highly skilled warrior and not a half-bad tactician. However, he usually forsakes skill to rely on brute power and innate toughness. So he grabs whatever large weapon available and attacks head-on. This works great when he is facing opponents far weaker than him, but he often gets defeated by enemies on his level or even weaker because they outsmart him or bother to use fighting skills.

Even when Harry has half his powers switched off in their first fight, he only takes a single hit because the Beast sucker-punched him. The rest of that fight and the rematch - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which, since Dudley's now a vampire, ends with Harry dismembering him</span> - is <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">one-sided.</a>
<div class="indent">"Anyway, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dudley</span> got in a few good hits before I realized that, broke a few bones, that sort of thing.

Sure, he's over 10,000 years old, but he'd spent most of that time in the Eye of Terror planning his Black Crusades and comparatively little of that time on the battlefield, and even most of his time on a battlefield had him engaging from a distance rather than melee combat. Cain, on the other hand, had spent virtually his entire adult life fighting wars or in transit to the next one, and as such had far more practical recent combat experience than the Chaos Warmaster. This allowed him and Jurgen to fight Abaddon and <em>win</em>. It is also mentioned that if Cain hadn't goaded Abaddon into fighting at his level (No armor, no psyker tricks, just weapon against weapon), the sheer difference in raw power would have allowed Abaddon to instantly crush Cain like a bug.

She doesn't know how to fight and has no battlefield experience, while Shirou clearly does, so Aizawa says Shirou would win. Sure enough, when they face each other in a training exercise, Momo tries to keep him at bay with a machine gun (with rubber bullets) and flashbang grenades, but he easily parries them and gets into melee range.

</li><li> Harry Dresden himself views himself this way, though as a full-fledged wizard he's got a lot more subtle skill than the average warlock or sorcerer off the street, and he gets better as the books go on. He thinks <em>around</em> problems, as opposed to <em>through</em> them.

</li><li> In general, the Dresden Files likes to play with this trope, pointing out that if you're big and strong enough, you don't <em>need</em> skill...but on the other hand, the bigger you are, the slower you are as well, and if a wizard knows what they're doing, you may well find your own strength turned against you or your weaknesses exploited.

<ul><li> In a weird way, the main character. He has the raw power to produce a solid, stable patronus at 13, and is able to access a fairly large reservoir of magical power (enough to face down Death Eaters and Voldemort when he's 17). However, he is continuously outclassed by Hermione, who is incredibly skilled, and any other wizard or witch who doesn't just rely on raw power for their magic. Harry ends up inverting this, in a sense, as he's a supremely skilled <em>duelist</em>. Interestingly, dueling isn't even mentioned as one of his skills until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">fifth book</a>, at which point it becomes clear that we've watched him live the past four years on his wits and creative uses of magic. While Hermione is capable of far more advanced magic, Harry is very good at managing pitched battles and out-hexing wizards with access to powerful dark magic through good aim, honed reflexes, and an ability to take advantage of his environment. So yeah, "in a weird way". The movies also show Harry at being extremely good at pulling up combat spells quickly, so he definitely skilled at <em>casting</em> spells. The best way to sum it up is that Harry's repertoire of spells may be more limited than someone like Hermione or Dumbledore, but he gets <em>excellent</em> mileage out of what he's actually good at.
</li><li> Hagrid. He never finished his studies at Hogwarts due to being expelled, but makes up for it by being a walking tank. Who happens to be rather resilient to magic. However, it's nonetheless shown that he's a good hand-to-hand fighter. On the other hand, Hagrid can do basic magic with the broken pieces of his wand hidden in an umbrella. Ollivander himself couldn't fix a wand that thoroughly broken; Ron Weasley was more apt to injure himself when his wand was broken, and Harry wasn't nearly as effective with an unmastered wand. In his own way, Hagrid is a very skilled wizard, just lacking formal education.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">the second book</a>, the Slytherin team uses the fastest brooms available on the market but lose horribly since not only did their seeker buy his way onto the team, their "tactics" amount to injuring the other team until they can't play. Their team as a whole seems to embrace this, as most of them are big bruisers who power their way through the opposing team in contrast to the Gryffindor team, who emphasize more skillful play and teamwork.
</li><li> Ron, in a way - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> he may be, but he still has a fairly keen grasp of magic. For instance, the students learn nonverbal spells in their sixth year, but Ron successfully casts one in his <em>second</em> year (although it backfires, because he was using a broken wand at the time. Still, the fact that he <em>is</em> affected indicates that he successfully cast the spell). In the seventh book, he notices that Voldemort's name "feels like it's jinxed" several chapters before it's revealed to <em>actually</em> be jinxed. In short, while Ron struggles in the classroom, he has a strong <em>intuitive</em> grasp of magic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Makes sense since he's the only one of the main trio to have actually grown up in the wizarding world</a>.
</li><li> Neville Longbottom actually starts the series as being neither skilled nor strong, due to a lack of self-confidence and a weak academic aptitude. After getting Harry's tutelage in the fifth book, however, despite lagging behind the other students in progress, he actually becomes very capable of holding his own in a fight, arguably becoming second only to Harry himself in this regard. His academic record never really improves, but by the time of the final book, he's an extremely accomplished duelist.

It's noted that, as the physically biggest monster in Dimension X, the other monsters automatically deferred to him as their king. However, as a result, he's not a very good fighter; when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">enlarged</a> Rod fights him during the second book, Rod is able to hold his own thanks to his training with Tar Gibbons, but as he points out in the narration, Smorkus Flinders' sheer size and strength still allow him to pose a threat.

As a vampire, he has superhuman strength, agility, and stamina, but absolutely no idea how to use them in a fight. His primary tactic appears to be "leap at anything threatening Valkyrie, with palms outstretched and shouting to attract attention". Given that the world is full of much older and more powerful vampires who can fight, ordinary humans with magic and/or martial arts skills, and, you know, guns! It's pretty stupid.
<ul><li> Really, the only reason he's alive is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">other vampires aren't allowed to kill him</a>, and every other threat is either too focused on the main characters or simply considers him beneath their notice.

In his arrogance, he is tricked into challenging Chad, the top male student in class, and is beaten senseless, when Chad demonstrates that Roy may be physically stronger than Chad, but Chad spends all his free time training and pushing himself to the limit. Once Roy is paired with Chad, though, the former starts picking up a few tricks, even though he never actually beats Chad <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until <em>Year 3</em></span>. This also applies to Vince, whose potential is virtually limitless, but he doesn't yet know how to use all the facets of his ability to their fullest. Mary is potentially the most powerful telepath and telekinetic in the world, but her lack of experience (and arrogance) means that the far more experienced Professor Stone is able to easily outclass Mary in that department (such as being able to control dozens of objects simultaneously, something Mary didn't even think was possible until then).

It's not actually true as he's learned to use his powers quite imaginatively. However, it's implied that he actually doesn't know his upper limits and often stumbles onto more power than he knew he could throw around.
</li><li> Richard Rahl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> was a pretty strong guy before acquiring the eponymous weapon. For most of the first book, he relies on the sword's ability to cut through pretty much anything and his ability to hit things really hard. Once he really learns how to use it, he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> (and the magic doesn't hurt, either).

In spite of his imposing physique, he's rather hopeless in a trial by combat, that is until he can get his hands on his opponent and turn it into a grappling affair. By the third short story, Dunk has gained more fighting experience and now considers himself virtually peerless with an axe or mace, suggesting that a little bit of skill has gone a long way in helping him take advantage of his natural gifts.

In terms of fighting, their superhuman strength and speed make them almost unstoppable by most human opponents. But this leads to all but the most disciplined among them to neglect their training, so the top human swordsmen stand a surprisingly good chance of beating a white-eye. In terms of magic, a white-eye naturally has more magic power than a human wizard so they can do feats of magic that beyond the intensity of anything a human wizard can hope to dream of doing. However, white-eyes lack a human wizard's versatility and seldom do anything but learn how to blast an enemy with magic.

<ul><li> "The Judge" from <em>Buffy</em> season 2. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">nigh invulnerable</a> demon who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> from range. So used to curb-stomping entire armies and never having to worry about dodging or fighting beyond "point and kill it", that when Buffy uses a rocket launcher, he doesn't even know to dodge.
</li><li> Glorificus/Glory, a powerful yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">bratty</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> that could tear apart buildings with her bare hands, but when Buffy used a weapon that could hurt her she was swiftly trashed.
</li><li> In the 6th season of <em>Buffy</em>, the otherwise physically unremarkable Warren Mears temporarily became this thanks to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>. In a fight with Buffy the far more skilled Slayer got in several punches and kicks to every blow Warren landed on her - but while he shrugged off her hits almost at once Buffy felt every one of his and was visibly tiring before she was able to destroy the source of his power.
</li><li> Caleb from Season 7, as well as the Turok-Han (prior to the finale induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>). Punch-for-Punch, Buffy is noticeably outclassed by both, serving as a potent reminder about the overconfidence the Slayer Strength may bring.
</li><li> Angel's son, Connor, also fits the bill. In contrast to Buffy and Angel's more technical approach to fighting, Connor is shown relying more on brute force, hitting hard and fast and beating his opponents into submission. On one occasion, he actually lost to Angel when the latter had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">amnesia</a> and was mentally a teenager fighting purely on instinct.
</li><li> Marcus Hamilton of <em>Angel</em> season 5 has little more going for him than vast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, to the extent that he easily beats <em>Illyria</em> of all people to a bloody pulp; though, in all fairness, Illyria was not at full strength at the time.

In contrast to several examples of this trope, the Daleks never grow out of this mindset and their solution to every defeat they have faced is simply to increase the strength of their weaponry and armor from what it was previously.

</li><li> The old <em>Marvel Super-Heroes</em> role-playing game actually quantified this. A "Fighting" score of Remarkable (30) generally indicated guys like Spider-Man and the Hulk, who had super-strength and clearly knew how to throw a punch but had no real training. Guys like Thor and the Thing, who also had that natural ability but combined it with serious training (or, in Thor's case, literally centuries of combat experience), had higher scores.

Furthermore, rules allow you to permanently lower your maximum in one of those scores to raise the maximum in its opposite. This allows you to create characters that can hit and dodge very well but can't deal damage or take a punch. On the opposite side, you can make these, who can soak tank shells and crush said tank with a single punch but couldn't hit the broad side of a barn or dodge anything. Unfortunately, certain skills and feats, like Power Attack and Impervious, completely broke down this balance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em>, this trope shows up a lot. Big Guy units like minotaurs and ogres have Str 5 which is essentially higher-end superhuman (Str 4 units are things like vampires, flesh golems and Chaos Warriors, while no human outside of heroes and those who lucked out on the level rolls have more than 3). But Big Guys are usually only capable of taking skills from the strength skill list unless they come from a race capable of having mutations or fluke out and roll a double when choosing a new skill. Also, some of the big inhuman races have lots of strength and high armor, so they can take a hit and win most shoving matches but these races typically lack any starting skills especially skills that influence ball-handling.

</li><li> The protagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Ragna the Bloodedge</a>. He's a partial example in that he has received formal training, but only in the basics of Ars Magus. Beyond that, he just really muscles his way through the opposition and uses the eponymous BlazBlue should the going get really tough. With the power of the BlazBlue, he has become the most wanted man in the world by the government and very few individuals in the series come close to his power. However, Ragna tends to get overwhelmed when he doesn't have access to his powers, which a lot of characters can negate. This also extends to gameplay as he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, which means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">attacking and doing as much as possible</a> is pretty much the best way to play him. <br/><br/>In <em>Chronophantasma</em>, Ragna loses the ability to use the Azure and by extension, the use of his right arm and eye, helping him realize that he should fight using his own strength and skills without relying on the Azure. While he does spend most of the game tossed around by characters who are either better skilled and/or stronger than him such as Kagura, Jin, and Azrael due the handicap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">he becomes a much more efficient fighter when he regains the use of his limbs and sight</a>, and even defeats Nu in the True Ending without using the Azure, something he was never able to do prior.
</li><li> Taokaka, compared to all of the characters, has <em>zero</em> fighting style compared to the rest of the cast, instead relying on her inborn instincts. Although she is still able to utilize seithr according to Kokonoe and Litchi, it's natural and without formal education as to how. This also extends to gameplay as she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, which means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a> are pretty much the best way to play her.
</li><li> Azrael is a subversion of the trope. At first glance, he seems to fit the mold, with his fighting style consisting of wild hook punches, haymakers, and an occasional kick. Kagura even notes that he mainly just throws his power around. But he is actually more skilled than he lets on as one of his Distortion Drives, Scud Punishment, has him doing what looks to be targeting an enemy's pressure point. He also serves in one of the tutorials and teaches the player how to confuse opponents with mind games. In <em>Central Fiction</em>, it turns out that this is played straight, as in his final bout with Kagura, he's derided for having no technique and relying on strength alone. Azrael even outright calls reliance on skill and finesse as nothing but fantasies that could never hope to win against him. Kagura then proceeds to prove him wrong.
</li><li> Terumi is this to the point where he makes a pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> Ragna and Azrael seem like master-level fighters by comparison. He fights with ruthless barbarity compared to Hazama's dance-like grace and is hell-bent on making his enemies suffer as much as possible. Despite this, he's so ludicrously powerful that you'd need to be on the same level as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Hakumen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Jubei</a> to take him on, or find a way to nullify his power source like Kokonoe did. <br/><br/>In <em>Central Fiction</em>, his true self as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Susano'o</span> is an even greater example of this. He completely forgoes weaponry in favor of pure, unrelenting brutality with much of his movements being unrefined brawling. Despite this, he's so unbelievably powerful that he can easily overpower Ragna, Jubei, Izayoi, Jin, and Noel <em>at the same time</em>. In <em>Cross Tag Battle</em>, he even outright dismisses skill and technique as "children of human weakness" and doesn't bother with such things out of arrogance.

He's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> given many of the same abilities as Ragna and also the ability to manipulate his own blood and shape it into weapons, plus he's nigh-impossible to kill due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> born from his life connection to Raquel Alucard. His game-plan is effectively "heal through the enemy's strikes and pulverize them, and I'll win eventually".

<ul><li> Sora himself. Having never served under a Keyblade master, Sora has had no formal training in wielding the Keyblade up until <em>Dream Drop Distance</em> and his fighting style is a mostly self-taught fighting style that stems from his play sword fighting days with Riku, but he makes up for it with tremendous willpower and strength of heart. It also helps that he has Donald and Goofy by his side to aid him.
</li><li> Roxas zig-zaggs this trope. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">wields two Keyblades</a>, which requires a lot of finesse and nobody barring Sora himself has ever displayed the ability to do so. His overall fighting style is not only powerful, but swift and graceful as well. However, his knowledge of the Keyblade amounts to it being a really powerful sword. The best example of this is his fight with Sora. At first, Roxas overwhelms him, but Sora, being an experienced and self-taught Keyblade wielder, calls his weapon back to his hand, with Roxas completely caught off-guard by this. This is a rather basic ability the Keyblade possesses, and Roxas is completely shocked by someone doing it.

</li><li> Hercules breathes this trope, especially in comparison to the protagonists. He shows no real fighting technique or strategy in matches with him, coasting by on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> punches and nigh invulnerability. He does have a sword, but only uses it in an awkward spinning attack.

This is further perpetuated in their battle animations, where half of the time they're practically stumbling over themselves. The fighter's axe and warrior's bow criticals, for example, consist of nothing more than the unit flailing his weapon around uselessly before attacking.
<ul><li> Brigands, Pirates, and Berserkers tend to count as this as well, generally having high strength and decent speed, but atrocious skill stats. Berserkers take it even further by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">an innately high critical rate</a> on top of that. They may only hit half the time, but when they do, it'll hurt.

Delthea, meanwhile, has a <em>ludicrous</em> magic growth, but an abysmal skill score (incidentally contrasting her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> brother Luthier).
</li><li> Hector from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em> is another example. He's got a great Strength growth and an average Skill growth, and Lyn comments that he fights by just kind of swinging his axe around when she first meets him.

The lance allows Sylvain to use Ruined Sky, effectively the strongest single-hit attack available in the earlygame. However, the lance also has a base Hit of just 65%, not helped by Sylvain's low Dexterity base and growth, as well as his bow weakness. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zk1c');"><sup>Why? </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1zk1c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zk1c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Archer class grants Hit Rate +20 upon mastery, but requires a C in bows to guarantee passing.

</li><li> Many wild Pokémon, particularly the legendaries embody this. Later on wild Pokémon can have higher levels and stats than Pokémon from trainers in the same area, but lack attacks outside their type and don't benefit from effort values. Legendaries can sweep an entire team if approached carelessly but often times only have one or two attacks despite high level.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragon type</a> as a whole.

However, most Dragon-type moves don't have secondary effects, but hit extremely hard (especially off of the Dragon-types' high stats) and are resisted by only 2 types to compensate for their lack of super effective coverage.
</li><li> Sheer Force is this in the form of ability. Pokemon with this ability can't use any additional effects their moves might have but such moves get an increase in power to compensate.
</li><li> Hustle is also this in ability form. Pokémon with the ability deal 50% more damage with physical attacks, but all physical attacks' accuracy is cut to 80% of what they'd normally be.

His fighting style could be described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> with weapons. This contrasts with classic Dante who was a savant with weapons he just acquired, and never had the skills before he got the weapons. Vergil also contrasts (though without falling into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> as he's still a formidable foe, just one who doesn't have the raw power of Dante) as he relies more on demonic power than being a good fighter, preferring his weapon strikes be quick and efficient instead of brutal and wild. Vergil from the original continuity stands above all of them, being both strong <em>and</em> skilled (he favors demonic power like <em>DmC</em>'s Vergil but even without that, during the first tussle with Dante in <em>3</em>, he easily demonstrates his raw fighting prowess by beating Dante in a straight half-demon to half-demon fight).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em>, Nero is this compared to Dante. He only has one style and weapon compared to Dante's small armory. His weapon can increase in power and range and his charged gunshots are a marked contrast, Nero's remain single shot, explode at higher levels and the recoil forces Nero to be at a dead stop to use while Dante fires more charged bullets while still remaining mobile. Nero relies on the power of his Devil Bringer while Dante cycles between completely different styles.
</li><li> Angelo Agnus falls into this. His transformed form is incredibly strong, able to effortlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lift</a> his opponents and take off huge chunks of health with his attacks. Unfortunately, as a scientist rather than a warrior, his swordsmanship is very sloppy; reliant on a single, easily evaded, two hit combo.

However, he lacks any finesse in his attacks as they are rather predictable, easily telegraphed and tend to be sloppy. The moment that he meets someone with an equal or greater power than him such as Dante's Sin Devil Trigger, he gets easily clobbered. This contrasts with V, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">who has all of Vergil's fighting skills but none of his power</a> or Vergil himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">who has both the power and the skills needed to fight Dante to a standstill</a>.

<ul><li> Endgame opponents in the pet battle system fall into this. They use Epic- and even Legendary-quality pets, while the player (currently, at least) only has access to Superior-quality pets at best, meaning these NPC have pets with stat totals much higher than anything players can get ahold of. However, these opponents also attack in set patterns, meaning savvy players with the right pets and timing can walk all over them with minimal fuss. For example, Courageous Yon can be real trouble for unprepared players, but a player who knows the fight can send in an Anubisath Idol, solo the entire fight with it, and have it walk away with <em>more health than it started with</em>.

Howitzers are pretty inaccurate (most have a shot dispersion rating above .5, well above the ~.38 that tends to be the standard for 'accurate' in this game) and their shells are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">Painfully Slow Projectiles</a>. They also have pitifully low armor penetration for their tiers. However, they make up for this by doing a horrific amount of raw damage, and often dealing at least <em>some</em> damage even on a non-penetrating hit. This means that howitzer tanks tend to just batter their opponents to pieces with brute force from repeated explosive hits instead of anything requiring finesse, such as targeting weak points.

Their mental stats also tend to be quite good, and they have a list of immunities and resistances to nasty things like poison, critical hits and psychology checks. Where they suffer is that only their heroes can use consumables or wear armour, and their martial stats tend to be subpar.
</li><li> The eponymous protagonist of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Knack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Knack">Knack</a></em> series has this problem. His fighting style in the first game is relatively simplistic, consisting mainly of a basic three-hit combo. His only ranged attack is a blast that targets all on-screen enemies and his only defensive maneuver is a whirlwind of relics that surround his body. That said, his sheer strength allows him to tear through armies of Goblins and robots, especially in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">giant form</a>. This is downplayed in the sequel, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">he gets a more versatile moveset that makes clever use of his shapeshifting abilities</a>, but he still relies more on raw power than actual skill and some of the moves he gets in the game (The Hook Shot, Heavy Punch, and Boomerang) have to first be taught to him by Ava. This trait is best shown in Chapter 3-1 during the Monk's gauntlet run. While Knack can easily overpower the human monks, he is hopelessly outclassed by Xander's relic creations, who possess all of his abilities but are far more skilled in their use. Ava bluntly spells it out for him.

He can also use the Ruby to create construct copies of <em>any</em> character with all their powers, personality and memories of the original, and also alter them to make them much stronger and more dangerous. He can even use the Phantom Ruby to create inescapable black holes. However, the Phantom Ruby does all the work: all his fights are him basically floating around, using the Phantom Ruby and his blasts, and his only physical attack is a rather weak and easily avoidable forward dash attack. It is implied that he considers "real" fighting to be beneath him now, and whenever his powers are weakened or neutralised, he quickly finds himself in trouble. In addition, even with the Phantom Ruby, Eggman shows a lot more proficiency with it's use than he does</span>.

This makes them largely inept at playing the skill positions on offense, or the secondary on defense. <em>However</em>: they hit the hardest and have the most health. They're perfect for the defensive line, and there are many capable-to-great Orc tight ends, guards. and linebackers. The all-Orc (except for one guy) Orcs of Hazzard team has a brutalizing defense that takes opposing offenses apart piece by piece, but can struggle to move the ball due to having only one offensive weapon (guess who). Compare Aliens and the all-alien team, the Galaxy Chaos, who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">all of the exact opposite strengths snd weaknesses.</a>

And that's before you consider the fact that he's nearly immune to normal attacks, has twelve lives and becomes immune to any attack after it kills him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh</span> is canonically the most powerful Servant in the franchise due to his insane Noble Phantasm, but his solution to practically everything is 'kill at range with extreme prejudice before it can touch me'. He's only ever engaged in a melee twice; the first time was when he wanted to simply toy with a foe too badly injured to put up a good fight, and the second time was when that same foe managed to circumvent his Noble Phantasm and force him into melee, a situation that leads to him put on the defensive and humiliated. This is, for the most part, what happens when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> for his ability: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his main power is to create portals to a pocket dimension which contains an infinite amount of treasures, especially rare and powerful magic swords. As each and every sword has a unique shape, weight, and feel to it, it's impossible for Gilgamesh to get used to any of them by simply pulling them out through a portal. Even if he does practice with one sword, switching to another will feel extremely unfamiliar and cause his swordsmanship to drop to its original level; as Shirou puts it, Gilgamesh is an owner, not a wielder. Therefore, Gilgamesh either takes to creating a lot of portals at once to shred his enemies with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades">Storm of Blades</a> or just equips a really tough suit of magical armor to make up for his lack of skill in melee. The one sword he <em>does</em> choose to wield (though only against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>) is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyShapedSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyShapedSword">Oddly Shaped Sword</a> that, while capable of forming extremely powerful energy attacks, is shaped in such a way that it doesn't seem good at all for melee combat.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>: In the original series, Ben's entire fighting style revolved around this. His typical response to a threat was to use one of his strength-based aliens, such as Fourarms and Diamondhead, and simply rush at the bad guys to beat them senseless. From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Alien Force</a></em> onwards, however, he is more tactical with his aliens and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">takes martial arts lessons</a> to minimize his reliance on the Omnitrix. Nevertheless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that, out of all three members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a>, Ben is the least skilled hand-to-hand fighter. It also states that if Ben and Kevin were to fight each other while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>, Kevin would win.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016">reboot</a>, Kevin builds his own Omnitrix-knockoff, (called the Antitrix) and modify the aliens' DNAs to strengthen them. This, however, means he has trouble using them well (as Wrecking Bolt, Cannon Bolt's counterpart, he not only finds it difficult to stop his rolling, but even <em>walking</em> without crashing into things). It doesn't help that he has been using it for a short time.
</li><li> Like the Original Series, Ben still prefers brute force (he <em>has</em> been improving over time) especially in Season 1. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">''Vil''</a> criticized him for how he was using "Gax" 's (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually Vilgax's</span>) powers.

</li><li> An interesting example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, being a good bender more or less requires being a good martial artist; but the effectiveness of this fighting style is dependent on the ability to bend an element, as standing ten feet away from your opponent and waving your arms around is not a viable fighting style unless magic is involved. This trope is both played straight and subverted.
<ul><li> Played straight with Ozai, Katara and Toph, who are all pretty much helpless without their powers, <em>especially</em> Toph; who is one of the most dangerous people in the world with her Earthbending, and a blind little girl without it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As for Ozai, it's not completely the case. His <em>other</em> greatest strength is his intellect. Without his firebending, he could do a <em>lot</em> of damage, even from prison</span>.
</li><li> Subverted with Aang, Zuko, Azula, and Iroh, each of whom has received or given themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">additional training</a>, and can at least hold their own without using their bending.
</li><li> Commander - later Admiral - Zhao seems to come across as this. He's clearly a powerful Firebender, but in personal combat, he's basically a joke. In his first appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Zuko</a> beats him in a one-on-one fight, and when he faces Aang for the first time, Aang doesn't even bother fighting him directly, instead tricking him into demolishing his own fleet (which didn't even take all that much effort on his part). This is mainly because his stated weakness is his total lack of self-control; he's got a lot of rage, which fuels massively powerful firebending, but reduces his fighting style to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> Korra herself is described in these terms:
<div class="indent"><strong>Katara:</strong> She's strong. <br/><strong>Other Master:</strong> She lacks restraint.
</div></li><li> Zaheer is this after a fashion. While he utterly dominates in most fights, he doesn't have the finesse that other airbenders do, thanks to only recently gaining the ability. His main advantages are his incredible fighting skills from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> days that he's combined with airbending, which precious few know how to defend against. When he comes up against Tenzin, a true airbending master with a lifetime of practice, Zaheer gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">utterly trounced</a>, spending most of the fight on defense and unable to get a hit in until the rest of the Red Lotus come in and overwhelm Tenzin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Dark Avatar Korra</a> is even more this than her real self. While most benders use reasonable and realistic fighting stances, she holds herself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalStance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalStance">Primal Stance</a>. An ordinary bender will dodge acrobatically by a few inches, while the Dark Avatar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Steps</a> several feet away in an instant. And instead of the martial-arts like motions and strikes usually seen in the series, the Dark Avatar flails wildly with the elements and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainPain">chain</a>, simply overpowering Korra. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's heavily implied to be a trauma-induced hallucination, and as such doesn't have to follow any rules.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>: Sandman, Electro, and Rhino have powers that make them very formidable opponents to Spider-Man (who often has to rely on a plot device or weakness exploitation to defeat them). Despite this, they're often demoted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a> when more intelligent characters like Doc Ock and Tombstone are around.
</li><li> Rusty the boy robot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigGuyAndRustyTheBoyRobot">Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot</a></em> actually has more firepower and toughness than his much larger father robot Big Guy. He lacks the combat ability and experience to use his arsenal to its full potential compared to Big Guy and his pilot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)</a></em> had The Starchild, a little girl with incredible magical powers. She's capable of immobilizing He-Man himself. It is pointed out that as she is a little girl who has not received any training, she cannot use her powers to her full potential. At one point, she has difficulty in telekinetically arranging stone blocks in a pattern. A more experienced sorceress does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalFusion">Mental Fusion</a> with her and is able to use her power to perform the task easier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2">Twilight's Kingdom  Part 2</a>", Twilight has a lot of difficulty controlling the magic of four alicorns in her body, and even her simple teleport spell she uses all the time messes up. All she can do in her battle with Tirek is blast him with beams of magic; but again, with the power of four alicorns in her, it works well. As in <em>blowing up mountains</em> well.
</li><li> The same with Tirek. Despite having Discord's magic, he uses none of his finesse, just throwing out energy blasts and the occasional physical attack. Again, not that he needs to considering he can blow up a building with a single blast and ram clean through a mountain without stopping.
</li><li> Applejack shows some of this — justified as she's never claimed to be a fighter. Though incredibly strong, fast and agile, she quickly gets into trouble when faced with the Changelings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Rarity</a> (the prissy <em>fashion designer</em>) once nailed her with a crane kick that she couldn't even begin to defend herself from.
</li><li> This comes back to haunt Twilight in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E25TheCutieRemarkPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E25TheCutieRemarkPart1">The Cutie Remark</a>" too, where despite being logically a lot more powerful than her opponent she proves unable to land a decent hit (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">at one point hits Rainbow Dash by accident</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, Luanne once faced Freeda Foreman in a boxing match. Due to her inexperience and lack of training, she could barely land a punch or avoid Freeda's, but her punches were strong enough to stagger Freeda, and she had enough stamina to last three rounds before getting knocked out. Luanne won everybody's respect that day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxSteel">Max Steel</a></em>, Max was sometimes scolded for relying exclusively on his enhanced strength and speed. He even fights this way when playing a fighting game, choosing the biggest, toughest character and relying on hitting and charging the opponent, while Berto chose a smaller character who easily dodges his attacks and knocks him out of the ring. Max does start fighting smarter as the series goes on, as well as improvising with the environment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>: Aku plays with this trope. He has shown on occasion that he is more skilled than he lets on as he is seen using weapons on occasion and is a surprisingly strong hand-to-hand combatant, but he relies mostly on his shapeshifting, his vast magic, and the fact few things can actually <em>hurt</em> him. One of those is Jack's sword. This is most shown and somewhat deconstructed in the aptly titled episode, "Jack Versus Aku". Aku challenges Jack to a final battle with only two rules: Jack is forbidden to use his sword and Aku is forbidden to use his powers. Though Aku manages to hold his own with just his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and hand-to-hand skills, Jack proves to be the better fighter due to all the time he's spent fighting and has Aku on the ropes, forcing him to break his own rules to turn the tide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Amethyst is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Quartz,</a> making her the only Gem among the surviving Crystal Gems to actually be built for fighting. Some episodes have shown her to be equal to Garnet in raw strength, despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garnet being a Fusion</span>. However, she's also the youngest, the laziest, the least experienced, as she was born after the first war, and generally considered "defective" by Homeworld Gems due to her small stature. This leads to her relying on berserker tactics or gimmicks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Shapeshifting</a> in combat, and her getting taken out or injured a lot more often than her comrades. In fact, she actually openly <em>dislikes</em> training, viewing it as a waste of time in favor of fully embracing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontThinkFeel">Don't Think, Feel</a>. "Crack The Whip" pits Amethyst against strong and skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Jasper</a>. Jasper wins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">in a landslide</a>, causing Amethyst to realize she needs to make an effort to grow out of it.
</li><li> Her relationship to this trope comes to a head in the following episode, "Steven vs Amethyst". Amethyst realizes that while she's been lazing about, Steven has been training hard and has not only caught up to her but is starting to surpass her. Despite that, the episode reveals that Steven considers himself this trope as he has Rose Quartz's great power but is still flailing about when actually using it. He views his achievements as accidental rather than the result of serious skill on his part.
</li><li> Blue Diamond (one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Homeworld's</a> 3 matriarchs) normally just uses her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">sadness</a> inducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> ability to incapacitate enemy gems and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman">immense size and strength</a> are enough to prevent humans (who are immune to said power) from posing a threat, but when forced into an actual fight with the Crystal Gems she just stands in one spot while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">firing energy beams</a> and is eventually knocked down but the course of the battle changes when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">militaristic</a> Yellow Diamond enters the fray.
</li></ul></li><li> The Irken Empire as a whole in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>. They elect their leaders based on height, consider turning an entire planet into a food court to be a good use of resources, and generally exhibit the tactical skills of a turnip... but it doesn't matter, because they have such absurd technological superiority over everything else as to be unstoppable.
</li><li> Some bots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, most notably the Dinobots and especially (Decepticon) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">combiners</a> as Devastator, Bruticus, or Menasor, that are far more muscle than brain.
</li><li> Star Butterfly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">lacks control and finesse in her spell-casting</a> and, as seen in the episode "Baby", has a poor grasp of simpler fundamental spells. However, she is also capable of casting high-level magic with relative ease, and many of the spells she uses (often to great effect) are ones she made up on her own. In fact, Star's magical potential is described as being on a level that hasn't been seen since her distant ancestor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Queen Eclipsa</a>.</span>
</li><li> This is actually part of the backstory for Shadow Weaver from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a></em>. Once a student of the wizard Norwyn, Shadow Weaver became disenchanted with her apprenticeship, particularly when she felt she was being overshadowed by a younger rival. She cut a deal with villain Hordak and became one of the most powerful witches on the planet, but she finds herself outclassed by mages at her own power level who completed their training. Old Master Norwyn is quick to voice his disappointment over how little skill she actually wields her massive power boost with.
</li><li> Most Gargoyles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> fight this way. Although each of them has superhuman strength, it shows that humans who can master the martial arts and use tactics are able to deal with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts">Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kipo is incredibly strong when transformed but she doesn't have any experience fighting and moving that way.

Likewise, there are a number of back problems that can be caused if you lift with your back (especially if you deadlift 200+-pound barbells without proper technique).
