</li><li> In the first of Troy Polamalu's Head and Shoulders commercials, one of his teammates asks if he's been using his shampoo, because it's for guys who want "thicker and fuller hair"; Troy's already impressive mane gets thicker and fuller each time the camera cuts to him when he denies it, until he sheepishly admits the obvious.
<ul><li> A follow-up commercial has Troy asking his teammates who took his shampoo, one of whom has a beard as big as Troy's hair. The bearded one says it was the guy next to him, who is bald.

He decided to stop at the same cafe, take the same train and - when accidentally missing his stop that he just now decided to get off on (which is, coincidentally, the same as yours) - jump out the window of a moving train for entirely non Kaname-related reasons. Really, it's entirely coincidence!
<ul><li> He maintains an equal measure of implausible deniability when pretending to be Mizuki's boyfriend, still insisting the case even after everyone has just watched him chase off her real one with a loaded gun.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kaname:</strong> Everyone already figured it out, Sousuke.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Sousuke:</strong> Seriously!?
</div></li><li> In a more serious example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light Yagami</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">irrefutable evidence to him being Kira was presented, his first answer was "I've been framed! This is all a set-up!". Aizawa told him to give up the act. Understandably, given that this evidence consisted of Light shouting "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">I win!</a>", and his name being the only one of the people besides Mikami's not being in the notebook</span>.
<ul><li> He didn't even last that long, really... far from it... In the very first chapter he explains his plan to get rid of all evil humans by killing them off to Ryuk. Ryuk replies that if Light pulls through with his plan, he'll be the only evil human left... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">Light, in turn, seems completely unable to comprehend the logic in Ryuk's statement that what he's doing is in any way evil whatsoever.</a> Clinical psychopaths have a tendency to never admit guilt for their actions.
</li></ul></li><li> In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kotonoha Katsura</span> denies that she's been wronged, and frequently tells people that she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Makoto</span>'s girlfriend and that he wouldn't cheat on her. After he tells her in person that he doesn't like her any more, it goes from implausible deniability to psychosis. She leaves several voice messages for him to a recording saying her call could not be connected, detailing plans for their dates together. In the end she says "Finally... It's just the two of us..." as she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoveToDismember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoveToDismember">clutches his severed head</a> as she sails off into the sunset</span>, although partially she is speaking the truth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheDarkSideOfDimensions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheDarkSideOfDimensions">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions</a></em>, despite his attempts to tell Kaiba that bringing Atem would yield nothing, Yugi decides to show Kaiba by reassembling the Millennium Puzzle. Atem does not return, as Yugi points out to Kaiba that Atem no longer has any connection to the puzzle and is gone forever. Kaiba becomes visibly shocked and starts shaking with anger, going to claims Yugi is lying and that the pharaoh is refusing to face Kaiba, and decides to make him come out forcefully by beating Yugi.
</li><li> A delusional example occurs in the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>. When Rosette confronts Joshua about his dependency on Chrono's horns, he responds "You're not Rosette. My sister was nice." After seeing a flashback of her <em>half-strangling</em> him when he (correctly) tells Chrono that her cooking is horrible, as well as eight volumes of watching her do things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunTooHoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunTooHoly">damage private property, abuse Chrono (at one point until he's lying in a pool of his own blood!), and calling her superior an "old hag"</a>, it's a tragic (and somewhat hilarious) illustration of how much of his memories he's lost.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>, the main trait of Mitama Mayo is this. No matter what she did to anyone, everyone is just pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> even though most of the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">she obviously did it</a>. One of the time, she even burns an entire house, holding a gasoline, an igniter, and showing it in front of everyone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">No one knows.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NagasareteAirantou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NagasareteAirantou">Nagasarete Airantou</a></em>, Ikuto refuses to believe in magic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">no matter what he has seen.</a> He assumes summoned spirits are just "creatures". One chapter has him partially transformed into an animal, which doesn't wipe his memory (unlike everyone who was fully transformed). Despite seeing friends look completely different and the changes to his own body, when he finally recovers, he believes it was just a dream. (Pitying friends try not to remind him of this.)
<ul><li> It is later explained in the manga that Ikuto was put under a magic spell to keep him from believing in mystical creatures by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his sister who is half snow fairy</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection">Ri Kouyuu</a> coming up with ridiculously implausible explanations whenever he got lost.

I have some goods to transport to the next town." Having heard that that particular man was occasionally rather harsh with his own donkeys, the Mulla didn't feel inclined to lend out the animal to that him, however. So, not to seem rude, he answered: "I'm sorry, but I've already lent him to somebody else." All of a sudden the donkey could be heard braying loudly behind the wall of the yard. "But Mulla," the neighbour exclaimed. "I can hear it behind that wall!" "Who do you believe," the Mulla replied indignantly. "The donkey or your Mulla?"

</div></li><li> TruTv's short-lived <em>Caught Red Handed</em> involves this trope as its main theme. The show consists of re-enactments of shoplifting crimes where it shows the daily life of Loss Prevention Agents capturing shoplifters, in which most times the shoplifters gives the most ridiculous excuses in the show. Notable mentions are:
<ul><li> A repeat offender eats and drinks inside a supermarket and leaves without paying. When Loss Prevention Agents catches him, he denies it... <em>even the fact that his face was viewed very clearly on camera</em>, claiming it's a blurry spot. The repeat offender even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">threaten to sue the agents deluding himself that all of his crimes will be dissolved due to their "false accusations"</a>.
</li><li> One shoplifter tries to get away with 20 packs of jeans, exit through the fire escape door and out through the fence. His excuse? He forgot to buy them and never see the sign that says 'fire escape door'.
</li><li> A thief intends to use refund fraud by picking up the 'selected' items based on the receipt he just picked up in the trash and ask the cashier to return back 'his money' in the shop. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">However what he doesn't know is that two agents were already at the cashier counter, knowing his intentions. When confronted, not only that he couldn't come up with any good excuses, he tries to pick a fight with them saying "People gives receipts every day", claiming that it's his receipt.</a> Fortunately, the agents manage to kick him out of the shop before things get ugly. If this wasn't a reenactment show, he might get arrested for his violent outburst.
</li><li> Two shoplifters who pose as a handicapped man in a wheelchair and a nurse pushing it for him try to steal merchandise. However Loss Prevention Agents catches on and only manages to capture the fake handicap while the 'nurse' manages to escape. The 'handicap' keeps insisting to be go since he's handicapped and claims that the reason he runs away by foot is because he was chased by them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Agent:</strong> Either Jesus managed to heal you or you're not disabled.
</div></li><li> One of the most ridiculous excuses is a shoplifter by the name John who steals a huge hardware item, rushes out through the front door and tries to enter the cab without paying. Luckily, Loss Prevention Agents manage to catch him in time. John's first excuse is that he's late for his flight at JFK Airport so he decides to put the stolen item in the cab and pays for it later. However once the agents doesn't buy his excuse, John's excuses becomes more ridiculous even mentioning that he's late for his train at JFK Airport. But the best part is his last excuse:
<div class="indent"><strong>John:</strong> Okay guys! Here's the truth! I'm actually from the Loss Prevention and I was here to catch you guys. Trying to catch you napping! <br/><strong>Agent:</strong> I can't stand his BS anymore...

(I don't remember the name of the guy he was pretending to be so I'll say it's "Roger Smith.") In the middle of the episode he's about to be introduced to a man (another name I don't remember, so I'll call him "Peter Jones") who is Roger Smith's oldest friend. Knowing his cover's about to be blown, upon meeting him Drake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">immediately insists "You're not Peter Jones!"</a>

</div><ul><li> The brilliant part is that Barney never uses the word "I". He could be merely commenting on the statement made by the previous person. Therefore, he never lies at all.
</li></ul></li><li> A straighter example occurs when Barney tells Ted that GNB plans to get the residents of the Arcadian Hotel to move out by filling the place with snakes... then immediately saying "I don't recall saying 'snakes'." when questioned. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">He keeps mentioning or alluding to them and then denying it</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> There's also a sketch in which Graham Chapman insists he can fly while hanging from a very visible wire, and if someone points it out just tries to insult their social class. And the Argument Clinic sketch dips in and out of this (No it doesn't!).

<ul><li> "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy is probably the best-known example of this trope in music. The evidence against the cheating character in the song includes marks the other woman left on his shoulder, <em>videotape</em> showing the two in the act of cheating, hearing them having sex, and then walking in on them having sex in three separate rooms of the house. In the bridge before the last chorus, the other singer decides to just admit he cheated and apologize, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">even calling out Shaggy's excuses as ridiculous</a> ("I've been listening to your reason / It makes no sense at all!").

(Originated from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2191876/entry/2191877/">press coverage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the 2008 trial of R.

Similar to the Shaggy song, the singer sticks to his story of spending the night in his hammock, even in the face of his wife pointing out that she took it down a week earlier, then breaks down and apologizes... for having spent the night playing poker with his friends, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">no women around, nuh-uh</a>.

His wife keeps coming up with even more implausible explanations ('that's not someone's horse, it's a clothes rail'), finally culminating with 'that's not someone else's head on a pillow, it's a baby'. In some versions there are two more after that, including a man's naked butt hanging out of a sheet being a pumpkin and a naked lover fleeing after 3 AM <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">being English</a>.

<ul><li> A staple of American professional wrestling companies is to have the heel color commentator blatantly pretend to miss obvious cheating by the heels and even justify their most atrocious behaviour, much to the chagrin of the face play by play announcer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> were perhaps the greatest combo in history and this trope was a large part of it. At Fully Loaded 2000, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcmahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcmahon">Shane Mcmahon</a> interfered constantly on behalf of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> as the latter challenged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> for the WWF Title. After Lawler continually lied and made excuses for what was happening, Ross finally had enough when Lawler claimed Shane pulling down the ropes to send the Rock onto the floor was an accident, and that Shane was trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">help Rocky out of the ring</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jim Ross</strong>: How can you continue to say ridiculous things you know aren't true?!
</div></li><li> Rarely, the face announcer will do this to justify less than honorable tactics by the face wrestlers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura">Jesse Ventura</a> would often rage at how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GorillaMonsoon">Gorilla Monsoon</a> would justify anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> would do, no matter how dishonarable. At the innagural Survivor Series in 1987, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a> was the sole survivor, his team winning fairly, with Hogan being counted out. Hogan returned to the ring before Andre had much time to celebrate, struck him with his WWF Title belt, knocked him out the ring and posed for the fans. Jesse was aghast, especially as Gorilla made excuse after excuse for Hogan's poor sportmanship. Over two decades later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> would call out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> on commentary when Cena would take shortcuts depsite being the top face in WWE. Punk would also be met with resistance from the face announcers.
<ul><li> Subverted and played straight during the 1989 Royal Rumble. After Hogan eliminated both Bad News Brown and Randy Savage (who was his tag team partner at the time) Ventura complains leading to Monsoon justifying it by stating it was "everyman for himself" (before trying to blame Savage, in the middle of a slow burn heal turn, for allowing himself to be eliminated). Hogan is then eliminated himself by the Twin Towers before illegally eliminating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossMan">Big Boss Man</a>. Monsoon tries to justify this by claiming it was karma, but Ventura points out that if the reverse had happened, Monsoon would be totally irrate about it. The WWF also tried to claim it was because the Towers had illegally manipulated the "random" draw with the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">Ted DiBiase</a>, so that they entered one after the other.

Of course, what Jericho meant in this context was that, because WWE had (kayfabe) refused to recognize the aforementioned match due to its extreme violence, the Unsanctioned Match had never <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">officially</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">happened</a>.

The house's owner wakes up when you tamper with his treasure box (in his bedroom) but since he's half asleep, you convince him that you're "just the cat" and he goes back to sleep. Tamper with it again, and he'll wake up again and realize that he doesn't have a cat - so you tell him you're actually a stray that got in. At no point do you actually <em>act</em> like a cat, and he buys your escalating lies for an absurd amount of time- it takes five conversations until he finally catches on.

And your party likely contains Sabin, who would probably recognize his <em>brother</em> even with a proper disguise. On the other hand, the moment he's regained the castle and the bandits have left, he'll act like he never tried to disguise himself to begin with.

The Tribunal, the usual player-run system of banning, had to be taken down for extended maintenance. In its place, the Player Behavior team rolled out a series of new disciplinary systems that could escalate particularly toxic players to high-level bans very quickly, instead of the several months that the old Tribunal would take to permanently ban a seriously toxic player. The old Tribunal included Reform Cards, logs of the toxic behavior that got a person banned, but since the Tribunal was down they weren't available. In the interest of transparency, Lyte, the head of the Player Behavior team, offered to provide chat logs to any banned player who requested them, publicly on the game's forums if so desired. This resulted in dozens of cases where complete psychopaths would claim that they were banned in error and that they were victims of a system gone haywire, only for Lyte to post chat logs that would make Marshall Mathers circa 2003 blush.

If anyone mentions Qunari soldiers who happen to have lady-parts and identify as women for example, the Qunari will claim that said soldiers are <em>men</em>. Because all Qunari soldiers are men. Likewise, if a mage somehow gains the Qunari's respect/friendship, the Qunari will deny that the mage is a mage, even if said mage is shooting lightning from their hands at that moment. Admitting that the person is a mage would mean trying to kill them/chain them up like animals since all mages are considered dangerous chaotic things according to the Qun.

The game doesn't really have a way to check for how plausible the accusation is, occasionally resulting in vampires unwittingly outing themselves to oblivious players by accusing a dwarf who couldn't possibly be a vampire, such as one of the starting seven.
