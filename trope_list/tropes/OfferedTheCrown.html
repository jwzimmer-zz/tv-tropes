But even though the Lightbringer prophecies say nothing about the throne, Kurnos, the reigning Kingpriest, nonetheless sees him as a threat to his power and so uses dark magic borrowed from Fistandandilus to try and eliminate him. Between Kurnos' violence overreaction to Beldyn and a rebellion in a faraway province, along with Beldyn's incredible healing powers which cures an otherwise uncurable plague in that region, Istar's public favor swings rapidly in Beldyn's direction, leading him to eventually overthrow the Kingpriest and claim his throne.
<ul><li> More literally, Beldyn seeks to claim the <em>Miceram</em>, or Crown of Power, from its hidden resting place.

The kingdom is in big economic trouble, and they'd prefer to simply merge it with a neighboring kingdom. But the people are fierce and independent, and won't stand for it.

After the three tribes (that each had their own leader) united, the obvious question of who would lead was averted by inviting two worthy outsiders to oversee a federation. Though Celestia's powers and authority have grown considerably since that time, she likewise elects successors from among the common folk (Cadance and Twilight Sparkle) to rule beside her. It's unstated if she's sired any blood heirs during her rule, but if she has they don't seem to hold any political power.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> example is probably based on the real-life example of Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon's marshals who was offered the Swedish crown (strictly speaking he was offered to become <em>crown prince</em>, but the actual king was old and given the throne pretty much <em>because</em> he was old, heirless and not all that interested in doing any ruling stuff), took a few moments to review the situation, accepted it, and then promptly declared war against Napoleon. His family still reigns today.
<ul><li> Bernadotte had been a staunch Republican and anti-monarchist in his youth. According to some sources, he actually had the Republican slogan "Death to Kings and Tyrants" tattooed on either his arm or his chest, which would be rather embarrassing once he got a throne of his own.
</li><li> There was actually a small political crisis when news of the offer came back to Sweden — the man who asked Bernadotte to take the throne hadn't actually been authorised to do that, only to inquire with Napoleon about acceptable monarchs (the circumstances that led up to all of this involved Sweden getting into war with some of Napoleon's then-allies and losing. The first choice was to offer the crown princehood to one of the sons of the monarch of one of the winning countries — Denmark — but that candidate ended up dying while touring Sweden). It was quickly decided to roll with it, since Napoleon seemed okay with it and at least it wasn't one of Napoleon's own family (see below).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note494tv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note494tv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note494tv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, Bernadotte <em>was</em> related to Napoleon, but only as an in-law and indirectly at that: his wife Desiree (a one-time fiancee to Napoleon himself) was the sister-in-law of Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, as her sister Julie had married him. That's why Napoleon thought he could trust his old rival to rule Sweden in his name, only to be shocked when Bernadotte brought Sweden into the Sixth Coalition.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Napoleon, he offered half of Europe to members of his own family. In 1806, he gave to his brothers Joseph and Louis the crowns of Naples and Holland respectively<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5k3ah');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5k3ah" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5k3ah');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The latter didn't actually work out so well for Napoleon; Louis promptly adopted the Dutch name Lodewijk and dedicated himself to Holland's interests, not those of his brother. As a result, Napoleon forced him to abdicate and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the French Empire as 11 <em>départements</em> of France proper.</span>, and that of the grand duchy of Berg to his brother-in-law Joachim Murat. The following year he offered his youngest brother Jerome the crown of Westphalia (a completely artificial North German country that Napoleon had just made up) in part to sweeten Napoleon's decision to annul his brother's marriage to the American socialite Elizabeth Patterson (as that marriage went against Napoleon's program of intermarrying with European royals). In 1808, Joseph was shifted to become King of Spain, and was replaced as King of Naples by Joachim Murat.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note63m8v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note63m8v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note63m8v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was also a poor choice on Napoleon's part. Joseph didn't switch sides like their brother Louis had in Holland; rather he had been beloved in Naples and was doing a good job of transforming it into a miniature version of Napoleonic France. But he was almost universally despised in Spain, and his installation as king almost instantly sparked an open rebellion.</span> Napoleon also declared that after his death, his stepson Eugène de Beauharnais would become King of Italy (he already served as Napoleon's viceroy in Italy).
<ul><li> Formally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> became emperor because the Senate elected him. In practice he already had all the power (as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">"First Consul"</a>, on paper sharing power with the Second and Third Consuls) since a successful coup, and the Senate was merely giving him the right title.
<ul><li> It ran in the family: his nephew Louis Napoleon became <em>de facto</em> dictator of the Second French Republic and had a referendum legitimize his powers, and then had another referendum elect him emperor Napoleon III. This regnal name was in recognition of his cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Napoleon Francois Charles Joseph Bonaparte</a> (Napoleon I's only legitimate offspring) who was nominally Emperor of the French as Napoleon II for 16 days (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">at the age of 4</a>), a reign which essentially no one outside the family recognized.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> is often said to have been offered the crown of the new United States, but this is false. In 1782, Col. Lewis Nicola suggested the formation of a country on the west coast of North America, and that Washington could be its king, but this didn't come to pass.
<ul><li> During the Revolutionary War, some of Washington's officers got fed up with the lack of pay, and considered rebelling against the rule of Congress. But Washington was loyal to Congress and he convinced the rebellious officers not to go through with it. This is what led to the myth that Washington had been offered kingship and refused.
</li></ul></li><li> Oliver Cromwell was offered the crown twice by Parliament, but refused because of the objections of his military allies and his own belief that God had categorically rejected the position via the result of the Civil Wars. As the civilian establishment really wanted him to accept (for one because it would widen support and limit the authority of the army), they settled for making the Lord Protector position pretty much a king in all but name. In fact, Cromwell had even fewer limits on his authority than any recent King of England.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7653o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7653o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7653o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This has lead to the myth that Cromwell refused kingship because accepting it would reduce his power. In reality, Cromwell held near-absolute power not because of any title but because he was Oliver Cromwell. Upon his death, his son Richard Cromwell became Lord Protector but was unable to command such power on account of lacking his father's charisma and talent for leadership.</span>
</li><li> Carl Gustaf Mannerheim was Regent of Finland in 1918, and was considered for the position of King before Finland became a republic the next year. He went on to command Finland's army and become its President (and still a national hero).
</li><li> C. B. Fry, a famous British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">sportsman, politician, diplomat, academic, teacher, writer, editor and publisher</a> (also a relative of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a>), claimed that in 1920 he was offered the Albanian throne, but declined. This was probably made up.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Witte">Otto Witte<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a German circus acrobat, claimed to have been crowned king of Albania and "reigned" for five days in 1913 by pretending to be the nephew of the Turkish sultan whom Albanian Muslims wanted to rule their country. The story is almost certainly bogus, but Witte was allowed to have "former king of Albania" inscribed on his calling-cards and his gravestone.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ostrogoths offered to support Byzantine general Belisarius as ruler of the Western Roman Empire after he invaded Italy on behalf of Eastern Emperor Justinian and they realized they simply couldn't defeat him. Belisarius, ever loyal, refused.
<ul><li> He actually <em>pretended</em> to accept in order to gain access to the Ostrogothic capital city and then, once Belisarius and his forces had entered the city, claimed the city in the name of the Emperor Justinian. None of this seemed to allay Justinian's suspicion that his extremely capable and popular general had his eyes on the throne and Belisarius was recalled to Constantinople and replaced by less-able commanders.
</li></ul></li><li> Miklós Horthy was offered the position of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent of Hungary</a>; in a twist on the usual ways this plays out, he refused the position because he wanted <em>more</em> power than he was being offered. Once they confirmed that the position would have some actual power, as opposed to being a merely symbolic position, he accepted.
</li><li> In order to fill a power vacuum in the early 1830's (after the murder of Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first head of state of the newly independent Greece), the crown was offered to a Bavarian prince named Otto. He ruled as King of Greece until his exile 30 years later...at which point the Greeks offered the crown to a 17-year-old Danish prince, Prince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Christian Wilhelm Ferdinand Adolf Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a>, who took the throne as King George I of the Hellenes ("George" being much more Greek<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0idjo');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0idjo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0idjo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">much, <em>much</em> more, considering that Georgios <em>is</em> Greek for "farmer"</span> than Christian, Wilhelm, and Adolf<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1375q');"><sup>** </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1375q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1375q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> at least more Greek than Wilhelm and Adolf, since Christianos is also Greek</span>). He reigned long and well (being assassinated less than two weeks short of his 50th anniversary as King) and his dynasty lasted (with an interruption from 1924 to 1935) until 1967 (technically until 1974, but a coup exiled King Constantine in 1967). One of its junior princes, Philip, eventually married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Elizabeth II</a>.
<ul><li> A really interesting point is that George wasn't the Greeks' first choice; in a plebiscite, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection">95 percent</a></em> of voters chose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s second son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, to become the next king. However, a treaty forbade the royal house of any of the Great Powers from taking the throne of a smaller country, and in any case, Mama was opposed to the idea. So George got it instead; and just to make this particularly funny, George's male-line descendant, the aforementioned Philip, actually <em>took the title "Duke of Edinburgh"</em>, and his descendants will (in all likelihood) occupy the British throne far into the future.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8yhnk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8yhnk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8yhnk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The British and Danish royals have a long-standing habit of intermarrying every two or three generations, particularly since the Reformation (as Denmark is Protestant, a kingdom of equal procedural rank to Britain, relatively powerful but not a Great Power, and more importantly <em>not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies">yet another dinky little German state</a></em>); George's older sister Alexandra had actually married Alfred's older brother, Albert Edward (later Edward VII), just twenty days before George took the Greek throne.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> When Belgium split off from the Netherlands, after some negotiations, the throne was offered to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a minor German prince, widower of Princess Charlotte of Great Britain, and uncle of the future Queen Victoria. He took it.
</li><li> When Norway declared its union to Sweden dissolved, it offered the throne to someone in the Swedish royal family. When the King of Sweden refused it, they looked around — the Great Powers were out, and after some consideration of a Greek or Spanish prince they offered it to a Danish prince. When the King of Sweden <em>officially</em> refused to let someone in his family take the throne, the prince took it.
<ul><li> Prince Carl (as he was then known) was wise enough to request a referendum in Norway before he accepted the offer, as he wanted to ensure it truly was the will of the Norwegian people to reinstate a Monarch. The result of the referendum was a landslide in favour of the Monarchy (79% in favour, 21% opposed), which resulted in the peculiar situation of Prince Carl becoming King (and choosing the old Norwegian regal name <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaakonVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaakonVII">Haakon VII</a>) ahead of his father, the Crown Prince of Denmark (later Frederik VIII of Denmark from 1906-1912) and his older brother (later Christian X of Denmark from 1912-1947). (Incidentally, his paternal uncle, the aforementioned George I of Greece, also did the same, becoming a king a few months before his father Christian IX of Denmark, and several decades before his older brother, the aforementioned Frederick VIII of Denmark.)
<ul><li> When Haakon returned to Norway after the Nazi occupation he asked for a referendum to see if the people still wanted him; they did. When Haakon died and his son succeeded, he insisted on another referendum; it passed. Hence, the people of Norway chose a monarchy three times in 100 years.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In 1868 the Spanish revolted and overthrew the then-Queen Isabella II. Though she had a son, the leaders of the coup were so fed up after a long string of bad monarchs that they decided no member of the Bourbon dynasty should occupy the throne again. So they offered it to a number of people including a retired general and war hero, and then to several minor members of other European royal houses, and all of them refused or were turned down because none of the candidates approved the nature of the new regime. One prince of the German Hohenzollern dynasty was about to accept but he was vetoed by Napoleon III of France, and the ultimate result was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 that finished the French Empire</a>. Then Prince Amadeo, a younger son of Vittorio Immanuele II of Italy (of the House of Savoy) accepted the throne after being offered it for a second time, and became King Amadeo I... for 3 years, after which he abdicated. After another year of wacky shenanigans, another coup proclaimed Isabella's son king, and the Bourbon dynasty has been the royal house of Spain to this day (though they had a rather long interruption of not being actual monarchs from 1931, when the Second Spanish Republic was founded, to 1975, when Juan Carlos I succeeded Francisco Franco as head of state of Spain).
<ul><li> The retired general was Baldomero Espartero. Juan Prim (leader of the revolutionaries) offered him the Crown first specifically because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">he knew that he would refuse it</a>. Prim was then "forced" to look for a foreign prince as a "replacement", which had been his first plan all along, since a foreign prince would be unlikely to favor one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">loosely allied revolutionary factions</a> in particular. Sadly, his choice was Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.
</li><li> Juan Carlos I was offered the crown by Franco (though only to receive it after Franco's death) instead of his still-living father Prince Juan (the heir to King Alfonso XIII, who had been deposed by the Second Republic). Franco mistakenly thought he had groomed Juan Carlos as someone who would rule as an absolute monarch and basically be a not-quite-fascist with a crown. Instead, Juan Carlos opted to restore democracy to Spain and reign as a constitutional monarch.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Revolution of 1848 a deputation of the short-lived German parliament offered the Imperial Crown to Frederick William IV, King of Prussia. He declined, because he would not accept a crown based on the will of the common people. In his own words, he would not accept "such a diadem of dirt and clay".
<ul><li> Plus that constitution was <em>shit</em> for the monarch. Much better to actually rule in Prussia than reign impotently in a united Germany.
</li><li> Also the Habsburg Emperor <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctation_of_Olmutz">made very the "kind" suggestion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (read: overtly threatened) that the Prussian King refuse the Crown and allow the German Confederation to be re-established. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">The fact the Habsburgs were the default President of the German Confederation was just a happy coincidence.</a>
</li><li> The German parliament of 1848 did get Archduke John of Austria to accept the position of <em>Reichsverweser</em> (regent), but that did not last.
</li></ul></li><li> During King John's turbulent reign, the barons opposed to him offered the crown to Prince Louis of France in exchange for his aid in getting rid of John. Of course, when John finally died, the barons seemed to reconsider having a French king and responded by switching their allegiance to John's son, Henry III (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">nine at the time</a> and not in any position to go around bossing noblemen).
</li><li> In a way, this is how the selection of popes happens during Conclave. The College of Cardinals elect a new pope by secret ballot, and when there's an agreed majority of votes, the now pope-elect is offered the Papacy. By tradition, the new pope-elect turns down the initial request out of humility before "reluctantly" accepting. In the distant past, there were popes who made considerably more effort to turn down the crown, and sometimes had to be all but forced to accept it.
</li><li> Similarly, many saints and blessed in Catholic tradition were hermits dragged out of seclusion to serve as bishops or priests on the orders of ecclesiastics (sometimes by the pope himself).
</li><li> Shortly after the establishment of the State of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a> was offered the opportunity to be its President<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note94ndf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note94ndf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note94ndf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although this position is mostly ceremonial today, it was not clear in 1948 that this would be the case; the person who actually took the job, Chaim Weizmann, tried to make the position of President more relevant, but was consistently outmaneuvered by Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidBenGurion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidBenGurion">David Ben-Gurion</a></span> though he ended up turning it down.
</li><li> The Glorious Revolution of 1688 had the British Parliament overthrow the Catholic James II and offer the throne to the Dutch Protestant William of Orange.
<ul><li> Actually, it was offered to James' daughter, Mary, along with William, who was her husband (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">and first cousin</a>; both were grandchildren of Charles I). This was one of the only instances in British history in which the king and queen were officially co-rulers, rather than one simply being the monarch's spouse.
</li><li> This (although it has never really been repeated) asserted Parliament's right to choose the monarch over the so-called "legal line of succession" if it so desired. It's for this reason that documentaries or news stories claiming that so-and-so in such-and-such a country is the "real" heir to the British throne are nonsense: since 1688 the British monarch is whomever Parliament says it is. Though this has become more complicated since the end of the British Empire; the former colonies and dominions have become independent nations but most of them still retain same monarch. Since all 16 of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations">Commonwealth Realms</a> rather like this arrangement and don't want to end up with different monarchs on account of inconsistent succession laws. As such, they all agreed in 2011 that any future changes would have to be agreed to by the parliaments of all 16 kingdoms rather than just by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ierh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10ierh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ierh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The agreement was prompted because up until that point no attempt had been made to alter the line of succession. But with a beloved queen having reigned for nearly 60 years already, they realized male-preference primogeniture was pretty silly in the 21st century, and banning succession by anybody who was married to a Catholic was equally outdated. So both of those rules were discarded. Though any royal who themselves converts to Catholicism is still automatically removed from succession, on the premise that would be rather awkward for the head of the (Protestant) Church of England to not be a member of the Church of England.</span>
<ul><li> This also justifies the idea that the British monarch reigns by the consent of the British people; if the people didn't want a particular person as monarch, Parliament could either (a) change the line of succession to exclude him/her<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note114vt7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note114vt7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note114vt7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which in a roundabout way is what the abdication of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Edward VIII</a> was; Parliament through the Government pressured him to exclude himself by his Instrument of Abdication, which had to be approved by Parliament; the Instrument also changed the line of succession to exclude Edward's children (of which he ended up having none, but they couldn't know that at time). The Parliament then approved the abdication by passing His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which amounted to "What His Majesty said. Good-bye!"</span> or (b) actively remove him/her if need be (although the procedures for doing so are most unclear, the previous circumstances being somewhat...irregular. By which we mean, the Glorious Revolution, i.e. a coup).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the semi-mythical Roman Kingdom that preceded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a>, most kings of Rome were not of Roman ancestry (of the seven+1, two were Romans, two and Romulus' co-king were Sabines, were Etruscans, and the remaining one was the son of a Latin outsider who had died fighting <em>against Rome</em> and had his pregnant wife enslaved and brought there). This was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>: while Romulus and his co-king Titus Tatius were of royal blood (Romulus as a grandson of the kings of Alba Longa and Titus as the king of the Sabines who joined Rome), the Romans did <em>not</em> trust hereditary kingship and would try and elect someone, who had the right to refuse.
</li><li> Near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a>, once during the Lupercalia festival, dictator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> was offered, in a semi-staged and semi-serious way, a laurel "crown" by Mark Antony to show that he was worthy of being made king. But, seeing that the crowd was rather hostile to the idea due the last king having been horrible<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122uiu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note122uiu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122uiu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to legend, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Superbus meaning "haughty") was the son of the fifth king, and tried to overthrow the sixth Servius Tullius. Servius defeated the coup but was generous enough to make him his son in law, and Tarquinius, after biding his time, criticized him in the Senate for being the son of a slave and having been elected irregularly, and had him murdered when he tried to defend himself. Tarquinius then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">seized the throne</a>, refused to bury his father-in-law and ruled as a tyrant until his son raped a noblewoman, at which point the Romans kicked him out</span>, Caesar judged it better to push away that symbol of royalty. Anyways, the event was another reason for his enemies to want to assassinate him.
</li><li> In the Roman Empire, emperors without sons would often adopt a promising man as their successor. Legally, they'd be considered the emperor's son, and inherit on his death. This was most notable with the "five good emperors", where the first four chose their own successor. The last left it to his biological son. Things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">didn't turn out well</a>.
<ul><li> The first of the "five good emperors", Nerva, was this as well even though he wasn't chosen by his successor. After being chosen by the senate, he was mostly accepted because he was old, childless, and fairly inoffensive.
</li><li> By law the emperor was proclaimed by the people, Senate, and army of Rome. In actual practice, however, the emperor could usually get the Senate and people to recognize his son as co-emperor, ensuring he'd succeed upon his death, and a rebellious general would get elected by his own troops first and by the Senate only after offing the reigning emperor. For much of the early Roman Empire, the emperor was also not <em>officially</em> a monarch, though he ruled with every bit as much power as a king. It took a long time before the pretense of republicanism was discarded.
</li><li> Even then, Roman emperors were always acutely aware of the need to maintain the support of at least two of three major groups—the Senate, the people, and the army—and to not overly piss off any one of the three. Unlike other monarchies, Romans regarded the imperial throne as a magistracy like any other, and mere "royal" blood could not entitle you to office if you could not convince the key groups that you were worthy of it. This perspective persisted even through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheByzantineEmpire">The Byzantine Empire</a> (during which time "autocrat" was one of the emperor's <em>official</em> titles).
</li></ul></li><li> The picture depicts the moments after King Recceswinth of the Visigothic Kingdom (in Spain) died in 672. Gothic Law said that a new king should be elected immediately in the same place where the last king had died, and so the military chose Wamba, an old palace servant, as he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">right next to Recceswinth's deathbed</a>. The only problem was, well, that Wamba really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">didn't want to be king</a>, and kept refusing to wear the crown until a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">captain of the army</a> drew his sword and told him that he would either put on the crown or lose his head. So Wamba took the crown, and reigned for 8 years... until he was deposed when he tried to pass a law that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">limited the powers of the army</a>. Considering that a third of the Gothic kings were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">murdered by their successors</a>, Wamba should probably count himself as lucky. (The people who deposed him eventually got a deliciously ironic reward: About 30 years later, the Muslim armies of the Umayyad Caliphate conquered Spain).
</li><li> Happened twice in the history of Mexico:
<ul><li> Agustín de Iturbide, who in 1821 was the Spanish loyalist commander in the War of Mexican Independence, reached an agreement with the separatists to turn Mexico a separate kingdom only in personal union with Spain. However, notoriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> King Ferdinand VII rejected this. Iturbide then looked for other princes in Europe that would accept the Mexican crown, but since all of them where reluctant because of Ferdinand VII's veto, it was suggested that Iturbide pulled a Napoleon and became the first Emperor of Mexico. He did, but was overthrown and the monarchy abolished within a year.
</li><li> Forty years later, exiled Mexican conservatives decided to turn Mexico into a monarchy again and searched Europe for a prince that would accept the Crown. They found it in Prince Maximilian, the younger brother of Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary, and took over Mexico with Napoleon III's support. But as the war turned to be more costly and longer than expected, Napoleon III pulled out the plug and Maximilian was overthrown and executed.
</li></ul></li><li> After the end of Jagiellonian dynasty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a> in the 16th century nobody could agree as to who should be the next king, so they settled on choosing them each time in by the noblemen of Poland-Lithuania. This led to, on one hand, awesome kings like Stephen Báthory (who never learned Polish, but invented <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_hussars">hussary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and John III Sobieski (who raised the siege of Vienna), but on the other hand, Poles had kings like Henry II of Valois (he absconded to France not a year after his election to become King Henry III of France following the death of his elder brother, Charles IX<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1329wq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1329wq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1329wq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Although the Poles officially deposed Henry after this, he continued to use the title of king of Poland until his death by assassination</span>) and Stanisław II August Poniatowski (who was a lover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Empress Catherine II of Russia</a>, whose support gained him his crown, but also made him unable to resist the partition of Poland). It did not help that elections not infrequently were decided who could pay more to bribe the noble voters and the result could get Poland involved in costly wars, e. g. the Saxon August II the Strong instigated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatNorthernWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatNorthernWar">The Great Northern War</a> and the election of Stanisław I Leszczyński (supported by France and Sweden) in 1733 led to the War of the Polish Succession, which resulted in August II's son August III being put on the Polish throne by Russian and Saxon troops. So it is no surprise that Poles, on the whole, don't look back too fondly at the Election Period.
</li><li> A lot of people tend to think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III</a> employed a military coup in order to get the throne, when in actuality the matter of the illegitimacy of Edward IV's children was put to those people who had been elected members of Parliament, resulting in the drawing up of a parchment roll (the text of which became the Parliamentary Act of <em>Titulus Regius</em>) which laid out the reasons why Richard should get the throne and included a petition for him to accept the crown, which of course he did.
</li><li> Pyrrhus of Epirus was offered not one but two crowns simultaneously; after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Battle of Asculum</a>, two messengers came from both Macedon and Syracuse offering the crown. Macedon had lost its king and the two successors of Alexander close enough to view Macedon as a prize worth defending, and Pyrrhus was considered the most successful general of the time with a reasonably large army. The 'large army' part was important, as Macedon was facing an invasion of Celts. Syracuse was having trouble with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Carthage</a> and Messina (which was ruled by mercenaries turned pirates), and went to Pyrrhus for help. Pyrrhus ultimately concluded that he could help Syracuse while fighting Rome, also putting him close to Libya on the North African coast (which was a long term goal of his), and opted for that. Unfortunately for him, both of these offers were time sensitive; he could not take both crowns, and the unwillingness of the Sicilian Greeks to follow his orders meant that he ultimately lost Syracuse (keep in mind, they asked for his help specifically because they believed he could lead them in battle; Syracuse falling to Carthage was not his doing, it was the Syracusans), the time spent away from Italy meant he could not take southern Italy away from Rome, and Macedon and much of Greece had been taken/saved by Antigonus II Gonatas.
