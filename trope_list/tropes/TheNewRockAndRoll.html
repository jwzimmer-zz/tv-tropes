<ul><li> On Sept. 18, 2007, a teenage girl in Kyoto hacked her father's head in half with an axe. The event made a huge impact in Japanese media, where it was linked to an event in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> where a teenage girl cleaves a man's head in half (to defend her father). Despite the episode in question having aired over a year ago, the next scheduled episode of the second season was canceled, as was the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em>. That the girl had said in an earlier interview that she wanted to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mangaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mangaka">mangaka</a> didn't help.
</li><li> The Japanese media attitude towards anime and manga goes much longer back. Around the late '80s, a serial child killer was found out to have several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">Lolicon</a> manga in his home, and the media jumped to the illogical conclusion that the killer had been guided by these stories and could no longer tell the real world from fiction, and pushed out lovely headlines like "There is an army of 10,000 killers raised by manga in our country". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a> lifestyle was also called anti-social — ironic, considering that the annual (and soon thereafter, bi-annual) Comiket was one of the largest public gatherings in Japan.
<ul><li> Let's not forget the <em>non-</em>Japanese attitude towards anime. When anime started becoming popular in places like the US, a few people attacked it for being violent and inappropriate (leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">a trope summarizing this misconception</a>). Some people even claimed that <em>children's</em> anime like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell">was the work of Japanese Satanists</a>. This can mostly be based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">not doing the research</a>, though. (It doesn't help that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> was definitely prevalent during times like this.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> has earned some media attention, with various public figures overreacting to people creating replicas of the titular note. To be fair, this is partially justified, as someone bringing their hit-list to school probably <em>should</em> raise a few eyebrows. And, well... if the teachers at Light's school had raised a fuss over a student bringing in a Death Note, it would've saved the SPK plenty of trouble finding him.
</li><li> Pick any headline about some ten-year-old that got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">hentai</a> out from the library. Remember... unless specifically instructed not to by the parent of an underage patron, librarians loan out anything in the library (except reference books) to any patron, no questions asked. They can <em>think</em> whatever they like about it, but a patron can borrow whatever they want. It's policy.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em> featured a sleazy murderer who had manga-style artwork in his house, which he even referred to as manga to make sure we got it. And then he gave one of them to the main character as thanks for helping him beat the rap. This was all gratuitously and embarrassingly irrelevant to the episode's story and was clearly thrown in just because the writer thought this is what manga fans are like.
</li><li> Anime in Chile met a lot of controversies during its peak in popularity, especially with the most popular series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> were accused of promoting violence, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> was said to be too sexualized for minors, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> was blamed for creating obsessive fanaticism (not to mention that some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias">"found"</a> evidence of it having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell">diabolical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction">messages</a>). To fix this, a new rating system was designed, with children's series given one of three possible ratings: "I" for everyone, "I 7" for kids seven and older, "I 12" for kids over 12, and "A" for adults only (anime films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> got this). However, that didn't work very well, since all those shows were broadcast at the same time (after school) and parents didn't bother to check the rating of the anime their children were watching, so it fell out of use quickly. Most anime that hit public TV nowadays tend to be very child-friendly series, as otakus looking for more serious shows download them from the internet or buy them at specialized stores.
<ul><li> Which created another controversy. In a very sensationalist news report about the otaku subculture that was a clear example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a>, they noted that anime distributors, who are mostly barely-legal importers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">series that don't come officially to the country</a>, have no guidelines for what they can and cannot sell to under-age kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Then they claimed that all anime is either</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">Hentai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">Yaoi</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yuri">Yuri</a>. It also said that anime encourages kids to engage in precocious sex and homosexuality and used cosplayers as an example.

<ul><li> Psychiatrist Frederic Wertham wrote a book in 1954, luridly titled <em>Seduction Of The Innocent</em>. It blamed comics, especially the crime and horror genres popular at the time, for juvenile delinquency, as well as corrupting sexual themes. He appeared before the Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency, which led to veiled threats of censorship; in the end, the industry adopted the self-regulating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">Comics Code</a>. Ironically, this may have helped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> genre, since it was easy enough for it to produce simple tales of good versus evil that even the harshest censor would pass. <br/><br/>While it doesn't excuse Wertham's jerkassery, he was not <em>entirely</em> making it up — comics at the time tended to have stories that would be judged PG-13 even by today's standards. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>, for example, had a good bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a> themes that track back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">her creator's interests</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">research</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>. Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a> stories were very violent and had horrifying imagery full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>. Comics weren't quite as innocent at the time as what survived into subsequent decades. Wertham was definitely playing it up, but the material is stuff even today's parents wouldn't want their younger children reading.
<ul><li> What makes the whole Comics Code thing worse is that Wertham really wasn't that bad of a guy. He didn't want the Code to be founded and was against it. He just thought that comics should have a rating system like TV and movies.
</li><li> The American witch hunt against comic strips in the 1940s and 1950s also blew over to Europe. In the Netherlands (otherwise a socially liberal nation at the time) many adults felt that comics would make children too lazy to read an actual book, so many Dutch comic strips from that era were in fact illustrations with novelized texts below them. Text balloons were totally absent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics">Belgian Comics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics">Franco-Belgian Comics</a> were allowed to keep their text balloons but were still subject to censorship and distrust from adults (most notably shown when the Union of Families tried to ban it). Many comic strip magazine editors and publishers were conservative Catholics who forced the comic strip artists to keep an educational and moralizing tone at all times. This also led to absurd censorship. For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a> was no longer allowed to use his revolver, something that's very difficult in a western setting! This environment was, however, not horrible at all times, since it inspired creator Jef Nys to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Jommeke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Jommeke">Jommeke</a></em>, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> in its native Flanders.

The main villain of the comic is an insane and evil version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Kurt Cobain</a> who is driven to madness by the ghost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>.

Also, Batman hates rock music after witnessing a rocker kill his girlfriend.
<div class="indent"><strong>Batman:</strong> Punk (music) is nothing but <strong>death</strong> and <strong>crime</strong> and the <strong>rage of a beast!</strong>
</div><ul><li> Not to mention the fact that — of course — he'd been listening to rock music on the radio on the day his parents were murdered and his father made him switch it off, which naturally made him associate it with and blame it for the death of his parents. One gets the feeling that Bruce Wayne couldn't do <em>anything</em> on that fateful day without somehow retroactively linking it to the death of his parents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> kicks in when you realize that if Bruce had simply insisted on continuing to listen to his radio his parents would've stayed home with him and they wouldn't have died in the first place.

Ironically, one gag involved an inspector watching Dukobu read the comic in the class, who instead of saying how horrifying it was insisted that this kid was a good example for the rest of the class, who should read it because it contains more complex vocabulary than your average novel. In one shot, the professor that routinely confiscates it is seen reading it, together with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText">a speech bubble filling 90% of the screen with text</a>.

Jack Chick previously explored the topic in an issue of his full-color comic <em>The Crusaders</em>, with some extremely bizarre claims: rock is based on ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid">Druid</a> beats and melodies used to summon demons (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> as the ones who exported them into the mainstream), and before they're released, all rock albums get blessed by naked witches at a ceremony, where they summon one of Satan's chief demons.

Well, duh, when you make a movie about gangs, it's probably likely to attract members of gangs, and some might be from gangs outside the area where the theatre is located.

</li><li> Goethe's 1787 novel <em>Die Leiden des jungen Werther</em> (translated into English as <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>) inspired a trend (termed 'Werther fever') of young men dressing like Werther. Certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> thought readers might copy more than Werther's fashion sense, and blamed the book for inspiring a wave of copycat suicides. It's a bit of a legitimate grudge: The psychological term for it has been dubbed the "Werther effect," where suicides increase after a report in the media. That is why suicides <em>are not</em> reported unless there is a very compelling reason to do so.

He later comes to realize that there is indeed a dark, demonic presence at work corrupting people into committing these crimes... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it's got nothing to do with the movie.

The reason? Supposedly, what they did was unproductive and seduced people away from a "proper" Christian life. During the Middle Ages, musicians were seen as corruptors of youth who presumably learned their skills in Hell. An interesting detail of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HieronymusBosch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HieronymusBosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>'s painting "Garden Of Earthly Delights" shows musicians in Hell hung on gigantic instruments.

Lots of fiddle tunes are attributed to the devil, and the idea of the fiddle music leading to fights and moral corruption spread during the mid-1800s. A certain psychotic woman and preacher was particularly vicious and scared a lot of fiddlers from playing. The result was that a lot of instruments were burned or buried. The tunes survived because a flute or a cither was less sinful.

<ul><li> Tritones are often used in sirens and train horns since you <em>want</em> those to sound harsh.

</li></ul></li><li> The waltz was considered scandalous when it was first invented because it was made for two people (usually a man and a woman) to dance together. They don't actually dance too closely or anything, but back in the 17th or 18th century, it was considered the equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatingDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatingDance">grinding.</a>
</li><li> An article written at the time satirized the panic;
<div class="indent"><em>We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last . . . it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressure on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the evil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion. ... We know not how it has happened (probably by the recommendation of some worthless and ignorant French dancing-master) that so indecent a dance has now been exhibited at the English court ... we trust it will never again be tolerated in any moral English society.</em>
<div class="indent"><em>The Times</em>, July 1816 editorial
</div></div><ul><li> Naturally, this article <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">was taken very seriously</a> at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> The first couple dances evolved during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a>. <em>The Volta</em> was considered the most obscene, since it had the couple dancing around in a tight embrace. The king of France outlawed it in 1610 (but that doesn`t mean people stopped dancing it. It just evolved further, among other things into — the waltz).
</li><li> With all the furor subjected at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> for being "devil music," one might forget that in the 1920s and 1930s the term was applied almost exclusively to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jazz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues">Blues</a>, which, unlike its staid reputation today, was thought to inspire animalistic carnal lust and violent behavior in otherwise upstanding young boys and girls, as well as the racist perception that it was "negro music". The music was played and danced to in sleazy bars, night clubs, and brothels, which also explains its morally corrupted reputation back then. Even in the Afro-American community itself, churchgoers felt that jazz and blues were a tool of the Devil. Thus spreading the legend that these singers, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a>, went to the crossroads to sell their soul in exchange for musical talent.
<ul><li> Reactions were even more extreme for ragtime, about which one historian wrote "not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> rolling his hips had as many parents and preachers up and howling and sending for the exorcism unit as ragtime did. After all, not too many kids have hips like Elvis's, but anyone who could play "Chopsticks" or whistle "The Star-Spangled Banner" could syncopate (everybody owned pianos back then).
</li><li> Ragtime was notably described by a 1913 New York Herald article as "symbolic of the primitive morality and perceptible moral limitations of the Negro type", which recommended "extreme measures" to prevent it from becoming popular with white audiences.
</li><li> Many contemporary Christian fundamentalists still cite the Blues as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalSeries">the origin of Satanic music</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> rock 'n' roll itself caused a moral panic when it originated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>. Many parents were scared by this aggressively loud music that seemed to inspire teenage delinquency and glorified rebellion and sexual innuendo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> was everything they feared: a handsome young man shaking his hips in suggestive poses, causing teenagers to scream in excitement. Authorities were afraid that this obnoxious noise would send their youth straight to Hell!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> caused moral outcry with some adults simply because they wore long hair. However, their controversy was quickly surpassed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>, who had a "bad boys" image. Wherever they played, riots broke out. They were constantly in the news causing scandals with their open use of drugs and sex. The band itself played it up with singles like "Sympathy For The Devil" that seemed to confirm that they were agents of Satan himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> also caused shock for smashing their instruments on stage.
</li><li> The hippie movement was criticized by many parents for being nothing more than a bunch of filthy, long-haired left-wing lazybones that refused to work and wash themselves and indulged in sex, drugs, and anti-war protests. The truth was a good deal more complicated: there were plenty of short-haired, older people who opposed and even protested the war, and longhairs who couldn't have cared less about politics because they were too busy getting high.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> has a funny cyclic pattern to it. First, the original '77 punk (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a> et al.) were seen as promoting crime, drug use, anarchy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">profanity</a>, and all other things that scare the old people. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a> were so controversial that their hit single "God Save The Queen" caused moral outcry, death threats, and Johnny Rotten being beaten up and slashed with a knife in the streets. The BBC denied that the song was number one on the charts and the band was even shadowed by the British intelligence service under the suspicion that they might be a Soviet plot. The reason that most people were frightened of punks had to with their appearance. Out of all the youth movements associated with rock music, they looked the most degenerate, filthy, diabolical, and dangerously aggressive. The "pogo" dance was aggressive, too, to the point where clubs would eject patrons for dancing that way. Their nihilistic attitude and use of shocking imagery (swastikas, gay pornographic art, images of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a>, ripped clothes, safety pins) also outraged older generations. When people started noticing the social message in the music, it became more acceptable. This led to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk">Hardcore Punk</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> version, as it were, which shocked people for a good decade. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, the new moral panic came from two sources: first, the punk scene's association with radical environmentalist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">animal rights groups</a>, and second (and quite confusingly), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StraightEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StraightEdge">Straight Edge</a> subculture (whose followers are devoted to a lifestyle of <em>not</em> using alcohol, tobacco, or drugs — celibacy and veganism optional), which was considered a gang activity.
<ul><li> Part of the problem with the Straight Edge movement's image has been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">militancy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugStraightEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugStraightEdge">many of its adherents</a>, which have led to violent confrontations at times (usually as part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">animal rights</a> or environmentalist agenda). There's also the unfortunate association with various small, but highly vocal, sXe splinter movements which have gone far beyond the original mildly conservative values into far-right politics, violent homophobia, and in a few cases, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. This has, on occasion, led to violent confrontations with militant anti-racist sXe groups.
</li></ul></li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction">backmasking</a>" controversy in the late '70s and '80s, when fundamentalist Christian groups began to claim that backwards messages in music could subliminally influence listeners, and that rock musicians were doing this to draw their fans towards Satanism. Many heavy metal groups, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>, were targeted. Others condemned rock 'n roll on the basis that the term itself is a depiction of sex; in fact, it refers to the steady beat. During the '90s, however, rock became considerably less controversial (due in no small part to the rise of hip hop and pop music becoming more flamboyant), with the last truly "controversial" rock band being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>.

</li><li> Petra, a band which helped pioneer the Christian Rock genre, included the back-masked message "What are you looking for the devil for when you oughta be looking for the Lord?" in their song, "Judas' Kiss".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveIronFrenzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveIronFrenzy">Five Iron Frenzy</a> also takes a swipe at the backmasking kerfuffle in "So Far, So Bad," a song about a hypothetical song which, upon reversed playback, would "tell the kids to stay in school."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>'s song "Announcement Service Public" is comprised of "You should wash your hands and you should brush your teeth" backwards.
</li><li> Larry Norman, known as the "Grandfather of Christian Rock", wrote one of his most well-known songs, "Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music?", in direct response to the claim that rock 'n' roll was inherently evil.
</li><li> In the mid-1980s, parental and religious groups were so scared of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> that a group called the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) managed to get Senate hearings on whether or not record labels should be forced to put warning labels on potentially "dangerous" music. During the hearings musicians like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>, John Denver, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister">Dee Snider</a> spoke out against music censorship, and the hearings ended when the major record labels agreed to voluntarily put warning labels on albums with adult content (which is where the now-familiar "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" stickers came from).
<ul><li> In fact, the catalyst for founding the PMRC was the song "Darling Nikki" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>, which contained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">overt sexual references</a>.
</li><li> Resurrection Band, known for pioneering Christian Rock/Metal, inverted this trope in their tongue-in-cheek song "Elevator Muzik", which described classical music as artificial and commercialized, in contrast to music which focused on evangelism and spiritual growth.
</li></ul></li><li> An article denounced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> as surely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">not a true Christian</a> (even though he is, in real life, a born-again Christian and a volunteer Sunday School teacher), not so much because of his particular style of shock rock, but because he happened to be involved in the rock 'n roll industry <strong>at all</strong>:

</li><li> Because of its raucous beat and unintelligibly slurred vocals, the 1963 hit "Louie Louie" by The Kingsmen was rumored to feature unspeakably obscene lyrics. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/funny/lascivious-louie-louie">The FBI even attempted to decipher the lyrics to see if they violated obscenity laws.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Eleven hundred pages later, the FBI confessed that they weren't sure if there were any harmful effects to "Louie Louie" or not because they couldn't understand the words.

</li><li> This has shown up in books as recently as 2005. At least one "youth minister's handbook" describes rock and roll as irrevocably tainted because Elvis was evil.
</li></ul></li><li> Starting in the early '90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">rap and hip-hop</a> music became an interesting case in that they were being attacked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> on <em>both</em> sides of the spectrum. Conservatives were concerned about the glorification of violence, gangs, drugs, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalcolmXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalcolmXerox">black militancy</a>, and liberals were concerned with the misogyny and homophobia.
<ul><li> Most of the criticisms of the hip-hop/rap genre is more <em>cultural</em> than, say, generational.
</li><li> It's also worth noting that a lot of criticism of rap/hip-hop has racial undertones to it, in the case of conservative commentators.
</li></ul></li><li> The song "Ya Got Trouble" ("Trouble my friends, I say trouble right here in River city...") from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em> is a knowing parody of this trope, with a con man decrying everything that was new circa 1912 (pool tables, ragtime music, pinchback suits, Horserace Gamblin', modern slang "Words like 'swell', and 'So's your old man'", and a whole host of other things) in order to create an artificial crisis that he can solve "... with a wave of my hand, this very hand."
</li><li> The Finnish metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi">Lordi</a> has occasionally been accused of encouraging Satanism or other unsavory things. While their <a class="urllink" href="http://media.timeoutnewyork.com/resizeImage/htdocs/export_images/630/630.x600.mr.lordi.prev.jpg">general appearance and stage demeanor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> is slightly demonic, more than one of the band members are Christian and have actually put God among their personal acknowledgements on the back of the CD. Song titles like "Hard Rock Hallelujah" and "Devil Is a Loser" is not the kind of thing your average Satanist puts out.
<ul><li> Just to make it even stupider, the song "Devil Is a Loser" was used as <em>proof</em> that they were Satanists. It's not exactly clear how a song about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">selling your soul to the Devil</a> is an easy way out for the weak that carries strong consequences even <em>beyond</em> losing your soul can be pro-Satan.
</li><li> Similarly, "The Pusher" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steppenwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steppenwolf">Steppenwolf</a>, a strongly worded <em>anti</em>-drug song, is often cited as encouraging drug use. Now we're headed into <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_USA#Image_and_social_issues">"Born in the U.S.A."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> territory.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> tried to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProdigy">The Prodigy</a> from performing their hit "Firestarter" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops">Top of the Pops</a></em>, which the band (who are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">electronic music</a> band with a rock/punk edge and mentality to them) recognizes as their "most punk moment".
</li><li> Ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the early 90s</a>, the moral panic surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a>, raves, and the drug use admittedly common in the scene (which has led to more than a few deaths by overdoses) has often left the genre and its fandom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">Overshadowed by Controversy</a>. It's become even worse as EDM has made a huge splash in America as of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.
<ul><li> Because one of the most popular genres of music at early raves was called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic">Acid House</a> (it actually describes the "acidic" sound of the TB-303 synth bass), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> assumed that the kids there were all on LSD. The actual amount and type of drug use varies by rave and by raver (many are even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StraightEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StraightEdge">Straight Edge</a>), but MDMA has the strongest association with raving, distantly followed by Ketamine, Nitrous Oxide, and good old-fashioned Weed.

</li><li> Parodied quite a bit along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo">Devo</a>'s opening band "Dove (the Band of Love)", which was Devo in different costumes. It's best summed by the intro to Dove's cover of "Gotta Serve Somebody" on Recombo DNA, with Devo's mutant mascot brainwashed into being Dove's lead singer: "We used to do devil music like that band Devo, but then Jerry over here sat down on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bobby Dylan</a> record, and the Lord came into him!

Admittedly, this is a parody based on Santorum's "War on Porn", but, man, few would be surprised if it was the next step. (And, since a surprisingly large number of heavy metal musicians and fans are politically conservative, or at least anti-liberal, it would have been very ironic indeed.)
</li><li> The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a> has an exhibit showing news reports and congressional hearings calling for censorship or banning of rock and roll. Some of them are strikingly similar to arguments being used today to try to censor/ban stuff, such as promoting violence and promiscuity or corrupting youth.
</li><li> The trope becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy any time a rock, metal, or other "heavy" song even so much as has the WORD "devil" or "Satan" in it; including instances where Satan is, in fact, the villain, where the minions of hell are punishing evildoers, or the devil/hell are being used as metaphors (often for drugs or abusive relationships). A crowning glory was a treatise dedicated to showing "the hideous birth of heavy metal and it's forcing the devil's will into our lives", whose entire premise stemmed from the line "Satan, laughing, spreads his wings! Oh lord, yeah!" That would be the final line of <em>War Pigs</em>, by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a></em>, and is speaking of Satan laughing as all the evil war-mongers who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">led the world to destruction just to line their pockets</a> are damned to hell <em>by God and the angels</em> on Judgement Day. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Apparently the book of Revelation is a glorification of Satan!</a>
</li><li> Averted with <em>Studio Brussel</em>, a Belgian radio station made in 1983 that aired pretty much everything that was unavailable for general audiences at the time, which is mostly rock, but also metal, hip-hop, house and techno. Everyone in the government wanted this to happen, mainly because it would allow Belgian pop music to keep being preserved.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DanielAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DanielAmos">Daniel Amos</a>, a Christian rock band that started in the 70s, mocked the church's attempts to incite moral panics. In particular, on the songs "Colored By" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma">¡Alarma!</a></em>), "Autographs for the Sick" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a></em>), and "Return of the Beat Menace" (from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarnFloorBigBite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarnFloorBigBite">Darn Floor Big Bite</a></em>), they skewer anyone who thinks prominent drums are a marker of "the Devil's music". <em>"White man through the P.A. says 'Dont beat that drum' / They tell him 'Go back, where does it say that?'"</em> Naturally, DA wound up in the middle of a minor fracas themselves: <em>Alarma</em> featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace">Eyeless Faces</a> on the cover, which the usual sort of people claimed were "Satanic".
</li><li> Flemish series <em>Zonde Van de Zendtijd</em> deconstructed the rock and roll panic scares with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zob0FX2712U">De CD van de Paus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (The CD of the Pope), where they made a classics documentary about alleged commercial singles made by the pope Benedict XVI. In a normal scenario, you would expect a new band with revolutionary music to get demonized as "Satanic", but because the pope made the single, it suddenly gets seen as a product by god himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">His successor Francis I</a> actually has made a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up!_(Pope_Francis_album)">rock album<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> The Internet catches a lot of this; whether it's porn sites or pedophiles trolling chat rooms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a>, the media are constantly trying to find new things to scare people about being online. This also extends to anything that can access the Internet. Big overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a>, here. Another infamous newscast dealt with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>, and how child molesters were allegedly using its PictoChat function to contact kids. Never mind that around the time of the article's writing, hardly anyone ever <strong>used</strong> PictoChat and that the function's range was considerably less than what the newscast said...
<ul><li> There was a story where they said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo">L33t L1ng0</a> is a language designed to hide secrets from parents, and they actually have <em>a translator for leet speak</em> despite the fact that the numbers in leet are supposed to look like the original letters. Leet did originate, at least in part, as a way to hide email from keyword-based filtering/eavesdropping software, so it's not entirely wrong, just blown way out of proportion.
</li><li> It, of course, does not help that there's plenty of places on the Internet that practically <em>revel</em> in this behavior (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">/b/</a>, Encyclopedia Dramatica, any given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockSite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockSite">Shock Site</a>) because they think it's funny to act like how every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardian</a> thinks the Internet behaves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">The subtlety is inevitably lost</a> on said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>.
</li><li> The Daily Mail seemed to be fixated on the internet during 2012, with porn sites, Facebook, Twitter and general bad behavior (trolls) on the internet featuring in headlines. The so-called 'sidebar of shame,' images of dead bodies and articles of a particularly adult nature on the Mail's own website caused some to call them hypocrites. In 2017, the Irish branch petitioned for the ban of youngsters having mobile phones after a widely-publicized criminal case was finished.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted to hell and back in early 2009 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>, the bandwagon that every traditional media outlet seems desperate to jump onto. Until they got bored with it and/or remembered the media's proper role in society is to make everyone paranoid. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/012610-facebook-twitter.html?ts">FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Before he was forced to resign, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shut down the <strong>whole</strong> country's Internet, in order to quell street protests against his rule. It backfired on him.
</li><li> In Britain, there are proposals to impose blackouts on social media, after it was heavily used in the 2011 London riots.
<ul><li> Several U.S. communities have attempted to pass legislation against using social media to organize flash mobs, not seeming to understand the whole "freedom of assembly" clause in the Constitution.
</li><li> On the one hand, the right enshrined in the Constitution is specifically the right to <em>peacefully</em> assemble, which disqualifies anything you'd care to call a "riot". On the other hand, this suggests the smart move would be to "infiltrate" the would-be mob during the planning stages, learn the times, and greet them with riot cops when they get there. (It's illegal to arrest the participants before they start anything — unless you have evidence of conspiracy charges — but it's not illegal to be sitting there waiting.) On the gripping hand, there's evidence to suggest that in the past, the FBI infiltrated certain organizations, such as CORE (responsible for the antisegregation Freedom Rides)... and tried to <em>incite</em> them to mayhem so they could be arrested and tried.
</li><li> It should be noted, however, that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_mob">flash mobs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, despite having the word "mob" in the name, are completely harmless; they're just fun ways to do unusual things on a large scale and weird out bystanders. I mean, come on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has a separate page for <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow_fight_flash_mob">pillow fight flash mobs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. Attempting to ban them would, indeed, be an infringement of the right to peaceably assemble.
</li><li> That depends on the flash mob. In Philadelphia, for example, flash mobs have a history of either starting out or becoming violent and destructive.
</li></ul></li><li> Mid-2015 saw a rise in more headlines warning the public about social media. Instead of pedophiles and stalkers, the new bogeyman is <em>terrorists</em>. ('Could YOUR child be talking to an ISIS recruiter???') While it's true that recruitment over the internet is an actual thing, the number gained through such a way is <em>paltry</em> (150 at <em>most</em>.) This still managed to produce the same reaction with old media you'd expect with something like pornography- many reminders for parents to make sure their kids aren't talking to strangers or looking at the wrong things (common sense, really).
</li></ul></li><li> In terms of new media technology, there's some overlap with this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>. If the new media has some drawbacks that the old didn't have for instance (you can't tape on DVDs very easily, making them more difficult for recording without a DVR or something). For that matter, DVR is useless as a replacement for VCR anyway, if you can't afford cable.
</li><li> With the rise in popularity of 3D printers, it was only a matter of time before someone made a 3D-printed gun. The online group "Defense Distributed" hosts CAD files for a fully functional plastic gun as well as lower receivers and mags for AR-15 rifles (the lower receiver being the part of the rifle that is legally regulated and serial numbered, and in some American states mags are regulated). Despite improvised firearms having existed since the 1900s (and at much cheaper up-front costs), and that a superior metal AR-15 lower receiver can legally and easily be milled from an 80% finished "paperweight," DIY guns went largely unnoticed by the media and politicians until it became associated with the rapidly growing world of 3D printing. Add a public who is all too easily sent into a panic over guns, and suddenly you have a wonderful new headline to remind everyone that they should be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">scared of new technology</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a>.
</li><li> Smartphones are the latest threat. Youngsters have access to pornography and, because of their superior knowledge of the Net access to strange websites that their parents don't know about (though there are predators- mostly older- out there). Even the drop in crime and sexual activity among teenagers is taken as a bad sign that they're too busy on their phones to indulge.

<ul><li> Patricia Pulling's one-woman organization "Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons (B.A.D.D.)" claimed that D&amp;D was "a fantasy role-playing game which uses demonology, witchcraft, voodoo, murder, rape, blasphemy, suicide, assassination, insanity, sex perversion, homosexuality, prostitution, satanic type rituals, gambling, barbarism, cannibalism, sadism, desecration, demon summoning, necromantics, divination, and other teachings." She blamed the game for her son's suicide, even suing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR">TSR</a> for wrongful death (she lost). Most of Pulling's arguments were demolished in 1990 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelStackpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelStackpole">Michael Stackpole</a>, in "The Pulling Report."
</li><li> The book <em>Mazes and Monsters</em> by Rona Jaffe, and its later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> starring Tom Hanks, both accuse tabletop RPGs, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> of encouraging occultism and Satanism, and even allege that players get so caught up in the game that they can't tell fantasy from reality. Ironically, the purely fictional book was cited as a "case study" by several rabidly anti-D&amp;D groups, so one must ask which side actually has this problem. This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">I Lied</a>. "Mazes and Monsters" was based on a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dallas_Egbert_III">missing persons case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was actually only the <em>official version</em> of the story anyway, since the detective involved was trying not to alert the actual people so he could continue his investigation. The media released this assertion as fact. Strangely enough, the movie makes it clear that the game itself was not responsible, it was just what he happened to be doing when he snapped. The other players are well-balanced with active social lives (although one does invent larping as an alternative to suicide).

</li><li> There was also a brief spate of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> when a guy who played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> maybe a <em>bit</em> too much got together with his friends, killed his folks, then drank their blood. There's a reason every White Wolf book since then opens with a disclaimer reading, "You are not a supernatural creature, and if you think you are, then for the love of God, seek professional help."
</li><li> In an attempt to avoid such allegations, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> and other Palladium Games all come with disclaimers like the White Wolf books, though not as tongue-in-cheek. It's usually something along the lines of "This book contains depictions of magic, evil, and the supernatural, which some parents may find inappropriate for younger readers. Palladium does not condone nor encourage drugs, violence, or demon worship." They even request that anyone running a Rifts website also puts up a disclaimer.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> trading card game, when it (and the whole franchise) first became popular, was a case of this. It was accused of distracting students during class, starting fights between children, and as one news report put it, "turning the playground into a black market" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">since apparently, to children,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">card games are</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>).

<ul><li> In Elizabethan England, there was a movement to ban tragedies on stage, for fear that all the weeping would corrupt British masculinity. That's right, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">will make you gay</a>.
</li><li> Theater in general was often the target of preachers in early modern Europe. The preachers claimed that theaters promoted immorality. Theaters were forcefully closed more than once. For example, when Oliver Cromwell and his puritanical supporter took power in England mid 17th century, all theaters in London were closed down. The same thing happened in the Netherlands in 1672; when the country was attacked by France, England, and two German states, preachers successfully blamed the cause of the war on God's displeasure, which was in turn caused by the theaters.

In the arcade days, they were blamed for wasting money and providing a place for unsupervised minors to hang out; with the early consoles came accusations of laziness, eyestrain, and illiteracy. Which is rather amusing, considering that some studies have shown that video games may actually improve reaction time and signal detection.
<ul><li> In fact, Britain's National Air Traffic Service recommends that prospective air-traffic controllers play video games for precisely that reason.
</li></ul></li><li> In late January 2008 there was an uproar over a lesbian sex scene in the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>. Cybercast News Service blogger Kevin McCullough claimed that <em>Mass Effect</em> had a full-frontal sex scene which took place with the player character volunteering information on how to make the act proceed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">Yeah</a>. This article would have fallen into the abyss of stupid blog articles never to be mentioned again — except that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News</a>, for reasons unknown, took everything the article said at face value and actually ran a story on the whole affair in cable prime time.
<ul><li> One of Fox's guest commentators, Cooper Lawrence, made the mistake of doing this while having a new book released. She showed the world what a genius she is by shrieking that she had never played the game but knew it was exposing children to a virtual sex simulator. Gamers showed her <em>why</em> that was a mistake by sending the book's Amazon.com rating screaming into the pits of damnation. In less than a week, Lawrence issued an apology and admitted that she was relying solely on rumor. Even noted frothingly anti-video game fruitcake Jack Thompson <a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/349423/jack-thompson-defends-mass-effect">called Lawrence's comments uninformed, and the controversy thus raised "contrived"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. All of this managed to actually improve the game's popularity, proving that there really is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">No Such Thing as Bad Publicity</a>.
<ul><li> Some of the reviews on Lawrence's book were genuine reviews, too, from people who had read the book and <em>still</em> gave it one star. Not only had Fox chosen an "expert" who did no research, but they also chose an expert who wasn't even one.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole debacle is especially amusing when you play the game knowing it happened - the potential lesbian partner (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountLesbians">an alien</a>) mentions that there are many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">misconceptions and bizarre rumors</a> about her species's sexuality, but people tend to obsess over it regardless. It's almost like they knew it would happen (admittedly, it wouldn't be hard to predict).
</li></ul></li><li> When reports of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre">Virginia Tech massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> surfaced, media pundits were extremely quick to lay the blame on the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em>, due to an offhand comment by a classmate who barely knew Seung-Hui Cho (the shooter). When later reports showed that Cho was an unmedicated schizophrenic who hadn't played anything more violent than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, those earlier reports were quietly swept under the rug.
<ul><li> Before that, of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> massacre was blamed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, as both of the killers were fans of that game. One of the killers, Eric Harris, said that the shooting would be "like <em>Doom</em>," and said that his shotgun was "straight out of <em>Doom</em>." When it came out that Harris had created some mods for <em>Doom</em>, there were allegations that some of the "Harris levels" were models of Columbine High School, with the demons replaced with teachers and students, and that Harris had used them to practice for the shooting. It turned out that they were just ordinary levels, and they are available on the Internet for anybody to find out — the most elaborate level can be viewed <a class="urllink" href="http://doomworld.com/10years/bestwads/infamous.php">here, third down the list, complete with commentary on the scrutiny that video games came under after the massacre.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <br/><br/>This outcry was mocked by Michael Moore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine">Bowling for Columbine</a></em>... in the very title of the film. Klebold and Harris were also avid bowlers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">so couldn't bowling be as much to blame as video games?</a>
</li><li> There is also ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperColumbineMassacreRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperColumbineMassacreRPG">Super Columbine Massacre RPG!</a>, which was decried as a glorification of the massacre itself and violence in general. Since the game is actually doing the opposite of that, it's safe to assume the people accusing it of this never played it.
</li><li> A similar even more clueless version showed up in a few news reports soon after the Newtown school shooting in 2012. They tried to blame the massacre on the murderer's love of Starcraft, a top-down strategy game, and Dance Dance Revolution of all things.

It's even more ironic since the character pointed out in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xAK-X0RA5o">the video clip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">potential pedophile</a>" is Mayor Tortimer — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">an NPC</a>.

But apparently it's an ordinary girl's romance story. Which did, in fact, cause her to go berserk. What were we talking about again?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> is perhaps the ultimate example. While its violence looks quite cartoonish today, no game up to that point (1993, to be precise) had featured quite so much blood and gore (except perhaps for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein">Wolfenstein</a></em>, and that was nowhere near as realistic-looking as <em>Mortal Kombat</em>). What's worse, <em>grade-school kids</em> were playing it, which was alarming since, had the game been a movie, it probably would have received a PG-13 rating <em>at the very least</em>. One could theorize that future editions of the game getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> were either a concession to this outcry or an ironic mockery of it. ("You want wholesome? We'll <em>give you</em> wholesome!")
<ul><li> Fittingly, the ESRB rating system was created as a result of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s media attention. It was only a few years prior to its release that video games were considered a kid's hobby; before that, the target audience was whoever had money to spend on them. Basically, what the trend is becoming today.
</li></ul></li><li> A rather shocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series. Despite its blatant use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a> and demon summoning (some have described the series as "everything the pastors thought <em>Pokemon</em> was in the 90s"), the games have attracted very little if any controversy. This is probably because the series is almost unheard of in the West, even among gamers. As for Japan (where it is one of the most popular franchises, right alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em>), they are much more laid-back, religiously speaking. It helps that many western gamers had their start with SMT through the <em>Persona</em> spin-offs, which don't refer to demons as such, but as... well, 'personas'. Even the personas that are <em>demons</em> in the main series. This most probably helped it slide in under the radar. Wonderful, what a simple renaming will do. That said, while it managed to fly under the radar of Christians, the depiction of Lord Krishna in <em>IV Apocalypse</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2016-02-04/lord-krishna-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final-gets-negative-reception-from-hindu-statesman/.98302">did receive some criticism from Hindus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Messaging options and settings on Nintendo consoles with online play are <em>extremely</em> limited, probably in response to those accusations that unsavory individuals could use online functions to contact children. Many online 3DS games don't allow for free conversation, opting for pre-set messages and the like; just enough to get by on. When one <em>is</em> allowed to enter a custom message in a game, it's usually limited to something under 20-ish characters.
<ul><li> However, when the 3DS was first released there was an application called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SwapNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SwapNote">Swapnote</a></em> that allowed people to freely communicate with friends and send photographs. It was discontinued in 2013 due to a couple of instances of child predators in Japan using the app to communicate with children.

<ul><li> Believe it or not, but in the 1970s and 1980s some concerned parents were actually trying to get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> banned and/or censored for the excessive use of violence. In the United States, some cartoons have been censored in syndication for showing troubling behaviour that could be imitated by children. Sometimes understandable (characters committing suicide, yet not being quite dead afterwards), but in some cases they managed to censor every gag where a character is shot, hit or exploded, thus ruining much of the comedy. What made the hysteria especially odd was that these cartoons were already more than 30 years old when organizations started to complain about them. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> said: <em>"Everything above 30 was raised on these cartoons."</em>
</li><li> This type of hysteria was predicated in the '80s by outcries against both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CareBears">The Care Bears</a></em>.
<ul><li> With the Smurfs, it at least somewhat made sense, since there were urban legends circulating that the Smurfs were either Hindu deities (because they had blue skin) or Communists (because their leader, Papa Smurf, looked like Karl Marx). There have also been accusations that "Smurf" is an acronym for <strong>S</strong>ocialist <strong>M</strong>en <strong>U</strong>nder <strong>R</strong>ed <strong>F</strong>ather; the argument falls apart when you realize that "The Smurfs" is just the anglicization of the original Belgian, <em>Les Schtroumpfs</em>.

Especially since this was an actual show not intended for children and broadcast on MTV to a global audience. The controversy especially took off when a child who lit his sibling's bed on fire was linked to an episode of the show. Later it turned out that the child had never watched the show, but nevertheless Beavis and Butt-Head became the new "corruption of youth that had to be stopped now". Ironically enough the series actually became tamer after that. Beavis and Butthead weren't allowed to say "Fire" in syndication and their antics changed from juvenile delinquency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">general acts of stupidity</a>.
</li><li> From 1997 onward <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> became the new shocking and subversive animated TV series. This time actually living up to its reputation with taboo topics specifically intended for adults and a lot of offensive imagery and quotes that upset both right-wingers and left-wingers.

<ul><li> After a school shooting incident in Finland, the largest newspaper of the country published articles concerning the corrupting influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, as the shooter was an avid reader of philosophical texts. Under the headline "Plato can mess you up."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> corrupts the youth, doncha know:
<ul><li> There was a fairly large moral panic regarding pinball in the USA in the earlier part of the twentieth century when people (mistakenly) believed that it was a game of chance and winning was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">entirely due to luck.</a> Many cities banned pinball for several decades until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe">Roger Sharpe</a> demonstrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">precise pinball skills</a> in court. Even so, some pinball machines still sport "entertainment use only" warnings to allay nervous communities.
</li><li> This isn't quite as nonsensical as it sounds. When gambling was outlawed in most of the US, makers of slot machines and other gambling devices tried every method they could think of to circumvent the ban. The most popular method was via flipper-less pinball machines, which were set so you could win multiple free games. If you didn't want to use the free games, the owner of the bar/parlor/whatever would give you back the cash equivalent.
</li><li> Of course, a modified version of the original pinball is still incredibly popular in Japan, where it's given the name <em>pachinko</em>...which uses the aforementioned circumvention strategy to get around gambling bans; you can win "prizes" which can be sold to a stall conveniently right next to the exit.
</li></ul></li><li> Culinary example: In the 1600s, some French bakers started making a bread called mollet for the peasantry. This being France, riots ensued. Why? Because the bread required little to no work kneading (and didn't need to be cut with an ax) and thusly it encouraged idleness! It also used ingredients from Belgium. If you eat it, you hate the nation! Debates about what French bread was acceptable went on until well after the revolution when a standardized bread recipe was proposed. Unable to find a compromise that would appease everyone about how wheat vs. rye bread, the new government eventually threw its hands up and told everyone to plant potatoes.
</li><li> The fork. No, really. It's decadent! It's a symbol of Satan! If God wanted us to use forks, would we have these wonderful fingers? <em>Hmm?!</em>
<ul><li> It's commonly said that China and its historical sphere of influence use chopsticks because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucius</a> thought forks and knives were too violent for use at a civilized table. However, while knives seem to have been used as eating utensils for as long as we have records, the first people to use forks as dining utensils seem to have been the aristocrats of the Byzantine Empire, some eight hundred years after Confucius. That said, chopstick-using countries definitely regarded using both forks and knives for eating as barbaric, at least at times, and still regard it as wrongheaded for eating their native cuisines. Even in the West, using forks to eat East Asian cuisines is a mark of lack of sophistication.
</li></ul></li><li> A large chunk of the premise behind parody series <em>Jimmy Macdonald's Canada</em> was watching the character label <strong>everything</strong> either decadent or dangerous. The show even featured a segment called Outrage of the Week, where "I show you three things, and then I tell you which one outrages me the most!" Winners included robots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyStewardess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyStewardess">Air Canada stewardess uniforms</a>, Swedish drill teams, hamburger speed-eating, Zambonis, and psychedelic body painting. Other things that he hated included ATMs, push-button phones, vending machines, Italian food, dancing shoes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand">American Bandstand</a></em>-type programs, honeymoons, and children wearing protective equipment while playing hockey. Oh, and rock and roll.
</li><li> "That capital T that rhymes with P that stands for Pool" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em>, and all the other dangers that Professor Harold Hill calls out: beer, pinchback suits, galloping in horse races ("Not a wholesome trottin' race, no, but a race where they sit up <em>right on the horse!</em>"), smoking, ragtime music, knickerbockers rebuckled below the knee, dime novels, <em>Captain Billy's Whiz Bang,</em> and words like "swell" and "so's your old man". This one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance">works especially well</a> because a modern audience might not even know what half of this stuff <strong>is</strong>, which just emphasizes the ridiculousness of the hysteria. Harold Hill could go after the evils of pool because a pool table was being placed in a billiards parlor. <strong>Billiards was okay!</strong> (For anyone curious, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carom_billiards">billiards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is somewhat like pool, but it has no pockets.) Let's not forget though... pockets make the difference between a Gentleman and a Bum! That's Bum with a capital B that rhymes with P that stands for POOL!
<ul><li> In addition, one of the evils that Hill rails against is Bevo a (now long defunct) product of Anheuser-Busch which was a non-alcoholic Near-Beer, further highlighting the ridiculous nature of the hysteria.

In general, any subculture that focuses on disaffected youth will likely draw the scorn of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. Sure, we've all seen it for hippies, punks, and goths, but as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> proves, there were actually movies about the moral scourge posed by... <strong>beatniks</strong>.
<ul><li> A central tenet of the beat movement was chemical experimentation, and they introduced or popularized essentially every modern "hard" drug except for LSD<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1z0a2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1z0a2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1z0a2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which was legal in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, but rare and used mainly in clinical settings</span> for recreational rather than practical use. Unprotected sex with many partners was also a big part of the movement, though they didn't give it the catchy "free love" moniker the hippies came up with. In retrospect, the guardians might have had a point for once on that one... though of course, the Beatniksploitation movies didn't really show any of that.
</li></ul></li><li> German politicians wanted to ban paintball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">since a school shooter happened to like the game</a>. It wasn't until some paintballers were brought into parliament that some of them realised that it wasn't a video game. Nothing about that last bit in the news though. Now that a few years have passed, most people don't even remember that there was another public scare.
</li><li> For modern examples, see Mormonism and Scientology, both of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a> in the USA (or, in the latter case, almost everywhere). LaVeyan Satanism, being as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> as it is, goes out of its way to invoke this; Anton LaVey himself admitted that The Satanic Bible is essentially an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Objectivist screed</a> under a layer of Crowley-esque mysticism and anti-Christian theatrics.
<ul><li> The conservative Christian attacks on Mormonism are ironic since Mormon culture is very conservative and prone to the same moral panics involving young people that Christians specialize in. The infamous "standards" sections of Brigham Young University's Honor Code (forbidding alcohol, drugs, non-marital sex, immodest clothing, and men wearing long hair or facial hair) were formalized in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> in response to the hippie movement. In 1975, there was a major controversy on campus over plans for a concert at the university's arena. The performer: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond">Neil Diamond</a>. The reason: his hair didn't fit BYU's grooming standards (the concert happened as scheduled).
</li></ul></li><li> In architecture:
<ul><li> The Eiffel Tower. Yes, <strong>THAT</strong> Eiffel Tower. The French version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> even has a whole section dedicated to all the backlash it received from publications at the time, including a petition under the name <em>Protestation des artistes contre la tour de M. Eiffel</em> signed by high-profile artists of the time such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumasFils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumasFils">Alexandre Dumas, fils</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyDeMaupassant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyDeMaupassant">Guy de Maupassant</a> and so forth. This didn't stop it however from being a popular monument depicted by many impressionist painters of the time such as George Seurat at the time of its release. The backlash was in fact fierce enough that there existed rumors that the Eiffel Tower was to be destroyed a few years after it was finished, but that it was averted at the final second.
</li><li> Modern art and architecture initially received this treatment in the West, partially because of its associations with leftist political movements and, in particular, the Soviet Union. Ironically, under Stalin, the same art and architecture were frequently condemned as "decadent" and "bourgeoise".
</li><li> Compare, say, the Bauhaus or the International Style to Stalin-era Socialist Classicism. Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">the Nazis and their snazzy uniforms</a>, Stalin knew what he was doing when it came to aesthetics.
</li><li> Oddly enough, the Italian Fascists were tentatively accepting of the more right-wing strains of Modernism and Futurism, giving semi-formal blessing to a style known as "Rationalist-Fascist", a form of Modernism which emphasized the Classical and Renaissance roots of the style. It's quite odd to see the "right-wing" <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Casa_del_Fascio_Di_Reggio_Calabria.jpg">Casa del Fascio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> set against the "left-wing" <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Moskau_Uni.jpg">Moscow State University<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, but it's actually rather telling; fascism, despite its right-wing associations, considered itself a revolutionary movement, while Stalinist socialism was often culturally regressive.
</li><li> This is still very much the case whenever a new, avant-garde building is finished. The Lloyd's "inside out" Building in London was heavily criticised, being at complete odds with the much older structures like, say, St. Paul's Cathedral. Ironically, there was <em>much more</em> protesting against St. Paul's when that first opened.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1700s, Marie Camargo, who was one of the first star ballerinas, caused quite a stir when she shortened her skirts a few inches to reveal her ankles. She did it in order to show off her fancy footwork, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> of the time still pitched a fit.
</li><li> Seattle megachurch pastor Mark Driscoll and evangelical leader Al Mohler both <a class="urllink" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013114169_yoga09m.html">condemned yoga<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because of its eastern roots, much to the amusement of the rest of Evangelicalism (and the world).
</li><li> According to some people in 18th Century England, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">rolling a hoop with a stick.</a> Yes, hoop and stick, aka <em>The Hoop Nuisance</em>. One of the most staunch opponents was Charles Babbage, grandfather of the computer, who also hated organ grinders. Imagine what he would think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltraSuperDeathGoreFestChainsawer3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltraSuperDeathGoreFestChainsawer3000">video games.</a>
<ul><li> The madness here lies in the fact that hoop trundling has been around since at least <em>Ancient Greece</em>.

</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Opera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Opera">opera</a> in its early days did have the support of Pope Clement IX, who even wrote some librettos (opera scripts) back when he was still Giulio Rospigliosi, several of his successors, along with many others, did their best to suppress public operas, whose oft-unruly theaters they saw as breeding grounds for all sorts of vice.
<ul><li> By way of contrast, the Puritan government during the English Interregnum outlawed theatre but tolerated (just) musical performances (because at least their performers weren't sex-crazed drunken reprobates). Opera, being classified as music rather than theatre, remained legal.
</li></ul></li><li> In general:
<ul><li> 1860s - late 1920s: The theory of evolution and communism, which were forbidden to mention as a teacher in the US during the roaring twenties. In Europe, the art movement known as <em>naturalism</em> got this as well.
</li><li> 1920s - late 1930s: jazz music and blues music, because they were associated with sleazy bars and brothels. To some racist white audiences, black music in general was degenerate music. The Nazis banned jazz in the 1930s, for instance.
</li><li> late 1950s - early 1960s: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Rock and roll</a>, comic books, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> magazine and television.

Hebrew numbers don't work that way, they are added up (6-6-6 would be 18) and the strokes in the logo are tall enough to look more like a Nun Sofit (worth 700) than a Vav (worth 6) anyway.
</li><li> Believe it or not, <em>silk</em> was this to Ancient Rome: the Roman Senate repeatedly tried to ban the importation of Chinese silk as clothes made of silk were almost see-through and thus considered decadent and immoral. (It also didn't help that Romans were paying a lot of money to an outside power for the silk that senators thought would be better kept within the Empire). Of course, the ban never succeeded.
</li><li> Also for the Ancient Romans, Christianity was considered this due to their assumptions that it promotes anti-authoritarianism, and cannibalism, something they had misinterpreted about the Eucharist.
</li><li> In 1896, the so-called "Women Rescue League" in Washington D.C. denounced bicycles because apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">they promoted immorality in women</a>, making them unwomanly and immodest, and petitioned "all true women and clergymen to aid in denouncing the bicycle craze by women as indecent and vulgar". The icing on the cake? They added that without countermeasures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">75% of cyclists would have become an army of invalids by 1906</a>. Interestingly motorbikes did not get the same kind of backlash as they were considered to be an economic alternative for cars, which were really expensive back in the day. Nowadays, with all the fear of motorcycle gangs, you see an inversion of the backlash.
</li><li> Postmodernism, which reacted to Modernism by pointing out how some seemingly-objective truths sometimes turn out to be the product of a perspective influenced by factors such as race, sex, and culture. Detractors claim postmodernists don't believe in any objective truth whatsoever, and that they are intentionally vague to obfuscate this. The moral relativism of postmodernism means they can't even insist that a foreign culture is doing something wrong. Meanwhile, modernist scientists don't want you to confuse their Theories for absolute truth since they could be overturned at any time by new evidence. The average layman is unlikely to be able to understand the average physics paper due to jargon and advanced concepts. And imposing a foreign moral code on other nations has been known to have wonderful long-lasting effects when applied during the Cold War when any Third World nation even smelled of communism. Postmodernism is the modern-day academic bogeyman, no matter what evidence to the contrary says.
</li><li> Cars, when used by teenagers, were considered this. Young people could go out without adult supervision; "parking" and drive-ins ("passion pits") were opportunities for sexual experimentation.
</li><li> Political correctness, ironically enough, is seen as a corrupting force by reactionaries (hence the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>). Rather than make people turn to debauchery, however, the drive to not intentionally offend by their logic leads to a slippery slope of censoring everything on the off chance somebody might take offence to it. Any changes made to media, no matter how minor or unnoticeable, is seen as kowtowing to unreasonable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian">Moral Guardians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie">Soap Box Sadies</a>, leading to a culturally and socially sterile society. On the other hand, the people who <em>do</em> see it as leading to debauchery reasons that political correctness heralds a slippery slope of permitting absolutely <em>everything</em>, including obviously harmful lifestyles such as pedophillia, bestiality, and grooming (whether in a sexual or a militaristic context), on the off chance that people get offended by their lack of inclusion.
