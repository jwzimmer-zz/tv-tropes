<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s Arkham Asylum. Whenever shown, it is a dark, dank, brick facility run by burly nurses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor">Mad Doctors</a>. Evidently, whoever's funding the place is more concerned with keeping the inmates <em>in</em> than making them <em>sane</em>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">And they can't even do that, either</a>. That said Not ALL the villains put there are actually considered insane. Arkham is just the only place in the area that is able to hold some of the more super-powered villains (such as Mr. Freeze and Killer Croc). Conversely, the ones that are dubiously sane but manageable in a normal setting (such as Catwoman and the Penguin) get sent to a normal jail. Even so, Blackgate Penitentiary isn't any more secure or safe.
<ul><li> Ironically, the Joker has been stated to find the Asylum relaxing. Some depictions show him willingly get captured after a caper so he can get some needed R&amp;R. Likewise, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, The Scarecrow notes that he views Arkham as his home and the only place he's really comfortable, and implies that most of the other rogues are the same.
</li><li> One issue tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explain this</a> by showing that it was secretly built by insane, nigh-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">Lovecraftian</a> settlers to cultivate homicidal madness instead of curing it, which is rather appropriate considering the name is taken from Lovecraft's writings. Pre-Crisis, it was established canon that Arkham's own founder himself went crazy and was bound into his own institution, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">until he died</a>. Don't worry, he kept himself occupied in the meantime by etching gibberish into his cell's walls with his fingernails while humming "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." The current canon of this, and the items immediately below, isn't especially clear.
<ul><li> In one version, his parents were both killed by crazies, and he thought that he could cure the killer. When the killer seems cured but kills his secretary in front of his eyes and then pleads for pity, Arkham decides that only discipline works against the "filth", which is revealed to not help with the super-criminals either, so he starts murdering them. In another version, the killer thanks Arkham for his efforts by <em>killing his entire family</em>. Arkham insists on continuing his treatment, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">in a way does so -- by electro-shocking him to death.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworld</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanOfArkham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanOfArkham">The Batman of Arkham</a></em>, had Bruce Wayne as a psychiatrist in an Early 20th-Century Arkham... where, in a surprising subversion, he genuinely helps people. The story opens with a breakthrough therapy session with Killer Croc, who is nearly rehabilitated because Dr. Wayne simply treated him like a human being instead of chaining him like an animal. Later, Wayne says that before he came, Arkham was indeed "the old Bedlam, where unfortunates were whipped, chained, and starved." But under the later direction of Dr. Crane, it reverts to the old ways immediately. Things got better.
</li><li> Another mini, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell">Arkham Asylum: Living Hell</a></em>, had it show that even when a <em>sane</em> person goes in, there's little hope that he will come <em>out</em> that way. This mini also showed us a side of Arkham rarely seen before, exploring the patients who were committed and never escaped but stayed as lunatic as can be, from ghastly cult leader Death Rattle to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">Mad Artist</a> Doodlebug.
<ul><li> Indeed, The Great White Shark was a perfectly sane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who plead insanity to avoid prison. Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">it worked</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">he wound up in Arkham</a>. The abuse he suffered from his fellow inmates left him genuinely insane.
</li></ul></li><li> It doesn't help that Dr Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum director and descendent of its insane founder, has a tenuous grip on sanity himself, and is often portrayed as more interested in <em>exploring</em> his charges' psychoses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>!, naturally) than curing them.
</li><li> And currently, Arkham was redesigned as a house of <em>punishment</em> by the new, nefarious... building manager or somesuch, without Jeremiah's knowledge. The Raggedy Man is already dead and attempts have been made on the lives of Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Killer Croc, as well. Following Jeremiah's final breakdown, the new director is a member of the Church of Crime...
</li><li> They actually managed to cure one patient. The Cluemaster entered a criminal mastermind who had the compulsive urge to leave clues at his crime scenes and exited... a criminal mastermind who <em>didn't</em> leave clues. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Oops</a>.
</li><li> Arkham Asylum is so bad that at times Batman's veteran rogues have been running an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfEvil">Academy of Evil</a> for less experienced inmates out of it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. Jeremiah Arkham himself described it as "The Ivy League of Insanity". During her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, Batgirl's enemy Knightfall went so far as to get herself committed to Arkham on purpose so she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">learn how to be a supervillain</a> and D-lister Condiment King is said to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">upped his game</a> after Poison Ivy taught him about how to turn plants used in condiments into poisons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Ravenscar</a> was pretty rough on John Constantine. In flashbacks, he's been shown being beaten, screaming and weeping in dark rooms while huddling in the corner, standing in front of the conveniently placed nearby cliff while considering suicide after being released, and finding himself so unstable that he ends up back at the mental hospital off and on for a period of two years. It doesn't help that John does have real mental health issues, including often crippling depression that can even veer toward psychosis and suicidal thoughts.
<ul><li> Turns out he wasn't technically even released. A Mafia don bribed the doctors to let him out because of John's alleged magical skills. Morals!
</li></ul></li><li> Ravencroft in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> which somehow seems to feature mostly crazed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spidey villains</a>. It was originally staffed by Dr. Ashley Kafka with Colonel John Jameson (son of the <em>Daily Bugle</em> publisher) heading security, and they were somewhat competent folks who actually managed to cure a few patients, including Vermin. (A victim of Baron Zemo's gene-splicing technology, Vermin was a rat-like cannibal and originally deemed a hopeless case; Kafka managed to cure him completely.) Unfortunately, both were fired due to some rash decisions by Kafka (she trusted the Chameleon too much in her efforts to help him) and the place only went downhill from there.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Ruins of Ravencroft</em> shows that Ravencroft Asylum is built on land that the natives of the New York region considered cursed because it was inhabited for centuries by a tribe of violent cannibals who worshiped the omnicidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> Knull, who are directly responsible for the Kassady family's history of violence and mental illness by infecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Carnage">Carnage</a>'s ancestor with Knull's essence. The end shows a second facility under the Asylum and implies that inhumane experiments were done there, which is confirmed in the following issue, by Mister Sinister, not only on humans but on all manner of aliens, mutants and fantastic beasts up to and including a lobotomized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>. It further states that after Knull's cult moved on, the land was the sight of a bloody battle during the Revolutionary War, of a Cult of Shuma-Gorath summoning their God, the birth of a Ghost Rider(specifically <strong>THE</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman">Headless Horseman</a>), the site of a Skrull invasion, and that construction was interrupted by someone being told to murder the Foreman by Mephisto. Finally, after Sinister went to Germany, Weapon Plus moved in and were openly experimenting on the patients in a collaboration with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> to make vampires wit no weaknesses with them using the holding cells in sinister's lab to hold the "Unwanted," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">hideously deformed</a> and feral mutant vampires made from the patients.

On the other hand... the lower levels are used as a prison for various superpowered nightmares and creations.

<ul><li> The facilities where Yukari was sent to for readjustment, are another subversion, in that she did note that the staff are rather kind and did help her make progress in readjusting, which seems to be a good place to be.

The novelization adds to this, revealing that Freeze had bribed the guards to get into Ivy's cells so he could kill her for almost killing his wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> shows that the Scarecrow runs the asylum and is using it as his personal lab and the inmates are often the test subjects for his fear toxin.

</li><li> See the documentary <em>Titicut Follies</em> for a horrifying glimpse of this in the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane at Bridgewater, MA, in the 1960s.

It doesn't hurt he's suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> and resides in private quarters available to the rich.

The place was originally decrepit, with the most insane patients being kept together in a giant pit. The facility was closed for an unknown amount of time after the volunteering Sister Mary Helena (aka Amanda Krueger) became trapped in the aforementioned pit (where she was raped and tortured for days) due to staff incompetence.
<ul><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason">Freddy vs. Jason</a></em> the place, while still housing the mentally ill, is used primarily as a quarantine for those with even the slightest bit of knowledge about Freddy Krueger. Patients are forced to take the dream suppressant Hypnocil, which has been known to put the taker into a (presumably permanent) coma.

In a subversion, the head psychiatrist <em>tried</em> to treat Baby Doll, but she didn't have enough time before the surgery date while the lobotomist questions the effectiveness of lobotomies in general, viewing it as flawed and ineffectual, especially considering his latest patient wasn't in need of a lobotomy. When he points out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she ordered the surgery, she realises her signature was forged and uncovers the corruption.</span>

Goines, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suspected villain</span>, is incarcerated alongside Cole and gives him the tour. Cole is shown restrained by some very fanciful instruments of torture, but in a way it is justified: to the staff, he's a lunatic who incoherently talks about time travel, plus he's incredibly strong and very resistant to drugs, so they <em>had</em> to restrain him in some way. The rest of the hospital appears a lot more humane than most fictional examples.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveEncounters">Grave Encounters</a></em> centers around a reality TV crew locked in an allegedly haunted insane asylum. It ends badly.

Also it's hard to say if the real horror is the staff or the ghost that's supposedly killing the patients one by one. In any case, the staff aren't wholly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonized</a> and the psychologist at least seems an okay guy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, he is- he's spent months trying to help a young girl overcome a split personality disorder</span>.

The grounds of the asylum feature wheelchairs and the skeletons of those who died when the bombs dropped, implying that the asylum may have been more kind to its residents than most depicted in fiction. However, the basement of the asylum features the cells of many of the residents of the asylum (some still containing the skeletons or ghoulified residents), as well as intentionally creepy scenes set up in various cells.

The place is in extreme disrepair and operates mainly as a front; the good doctor is exploiting the patients for his research in a secret lab below.

The inmates are near-catatonic and dressed in drab jumpsuits and creepy masks of the Founding Fathers and security involves the "Boys of Silence", who wear horrible iron masks with noise-amplifying trumpets sticking out of the sides, and if they spot you they'll let out a dreadful scream that drives nearby inmates berserk.

The asylum was abandoned but reopened in modern times by Murkoff Corporation, who used the new patients as guinea pigs for experiments not necessarily related to improving mental health since they figured no one would care about the rights of mental patients.
</li><li> Implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daylight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daylight">Daylight</a></em>, as the hospital's heyday was in the late 19th century to early 20th century. However, the notes portray the overall running of the hospital as generally orderly with the staff trying to do the best they could, despite a level of monetary-driven corruption by the management and recurring disturbing paranormal events. The management of the attached prison next door, on the other hand, was an entirely different matter, with prisoners being tortured to obtained confessions, in order to justify keeping them there.

The staff at the mental facility take great care to help their patients and the building has a great many amenities to help with the healing process. Of course, this is a horror game, so the place has some dark secrets, the most important of which is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it isn't real. It is located in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamLand">Dream Land</a> or a sort of purgatory or limbo.</span>

It's immediately clear something is not right, as when you walk into it, you'll hear ominous music combined with periodic heavy thudding, even though the Shadeling doctors assure you everything is fine. Then, once you manage to best the Red Shadelings in combat in every area, you can come back to help the staff deal with their only two patients. One is a woman losing her mind due to being pregnant with a demonic foetus, and doctors are planning to carry out an abortion against her will to cure her. The other one is a former soldier now consumed by depression and melancholy, and the dialogue between him and the doctor implies that the hospital is considering euthanasia against his will. In both cases, their refusal sparks a difficult boss fight that ends with them alive and their fate uncertain (they're subdued, but doctors also appear to back down on their extreme plans in favour of other measures.)

Blood cakes the walls (including <em>piles of severed limbs lying about</em>), pharmaceuticals such as "purified lead tablets" and "cocaine extract in alcohol" have been left lying around, and the place is generally in a state of abysmal disrepair. The only other inmates are bound in straitjackets, have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">had their eyes sew shut</a></em>, and have apparently been abused to the point that they will rip Thomas's throat out if he gets too close or they hear him walking around.

Fortunately, by the time the player characters arrive on the scene they're <em>usually</em> abandoned save for hints of what once happened there. Stygia's angelic rivals also had an unhealthy understanding of mental illness but used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">different</a> strategy.

It's a friendly and modern secondary school aimed to help teenagers with mental health issues. It <em>is</em>, however, an old campus dating back to the mid-1800s and it still has some equipment from a few decades ago. Irene lets it slip that there are still old therapy rooms where they "still have all the cool, antique heavy-duty leather restraints and mental dentist chairs 'an stuff".

It's kind of foreboding on the outside, the inside is either stark white or dim and grimy depending on which part of the asylum you're in, and the patients seem semi-neglected because the only staff it appears to have is the staff that's appeared onscreen, so it's more like a detention center for people diagnosed as insane, with occasional bouts of genuinely attempting to cure patients who may or may not be too intimidated by the staff to accept the help. The staff has their own share of psychological issues: The directors used to be a crack therapeutic team (aside from being slightly trigger-happy with lobotomies) but have retired from active practice, and the actual therapists are a tiny idealist with a fragile ego; his old college classmate who is a hateful shrew with misandrist tendencies, a mechanical claw for a left hand, and no bedside manner to speak of; and an equally hateful, slightly pathetic middle-aged man who is <em>theoretically</em> smart enough and skilled enough to be a decent therapist, but is too apathetic to do anything but cram medication down the patient's throat. The best therapist on staff is the 25-year-old intern, who spends more time running around catching escaped inmates with an oversized butterfly net. And that's <em>part of his job description</em>.

Conveniently, his white outfit makes him look like a patient, so he is restrained and kept there (apparently, the fact that there's no record of the man being checked in doesn't faze the staff in the least). After several failed methods, including psychotherapy (talking) and psychopharmacology (drugs), the doctor chooses to lobotomize "Lord Raiden" to calm him down. Luckily for Raiden, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, so it likely doesn't do any permanent damage to him. Not that it justifies the quack who thinks it's a great idea to remove parts of a patient's brain to keep him quiet. He probably has a jar of leeches in his office in case the lobotomy fails.

The mental hospital in the show is obviously a very nice place, and the patients are, for the most part, content with their surroundings and treated well. The hospital is run by Doctor Princess, one of the most respected doctors in the kingdom. A character who attempted suicide was taken here, to show the audience that he has hope of recovering and being happy.

<ul><li> In general, Arkham Asylum is less a case of Bedlam House in than in the source comic. The architecture is still oppressive, and the better-known inmates seem to enjoy making life hell for each other, but it is shown to have some good doctors, who have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">sadly temporary</a> success with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace">Harvey Dent</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler">Edward Nygma</a>.
</li><li> Harley Quinn was also a therapist at Arkham that fell in love with the Joker. It shows the place isn't that great for its staff either.
</li><li> Ironically, one episode of the series where the staff seems competent at both treating and restraining inmates is in "Dreams in Darkness" where Batman is accidentally committed and seems to have more trouble escaping (or convincing the doctors he is sane) than most of the inmates do.
</li><li> The episode "Lock-Up", however, features Arkham guard Lyle Bolton, who gets fired after it's revealed he's on a serious power trip that has made him violently abusive to inmates including Harley and Jonathon Crane.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">the Justice Lords alternate world</a>, Arkham Asylum looks incredibly pleasant both inside and out.

Averted with the group psychology sessions in "Payback", which appear to be normal and healthy talk sessions, though they were not featured long enough to tell if they were or were not effective.

Oh, and the guards have the authority to carry around tasers and dress in robes that make them look like they're prepared to do a lobotomy on a second's notice.

And when Ned Flanders checks himself in after a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">emotional breakdown</a> in "Hurricane Neddy", the disinterested admitting nurse only asks if he wants to be calmly shown his room or dragged off kicking and screaming. Ned cheerfully chooses the kicking and screaming. (Ironically, the doctor in charge there seems rather competent.)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> season three episode "Webworld", Cyclonus takes Galvatron to the planet Torkulon in the hopes that his madness can be cured. Galvatron doesn't take to the therapy very well, and the Torkulons eventually try to give him a lobotomy-equivalent by jacking his mind into the planet itself while Cyclonus helplessly looks on in horror. Fortunately, Galvatron's willpower is so strong that he drives <em>his</em> mind into the planet and figures out how to destroy it. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> soon follows... and once he's done, Galvatron actually seems quite calm. For a little while, anyway.
<ul><li> It was less a case of Galvatron's willpower than the fact that he was so insane that <em>the planet itself was driven nuts</em> just looking at his processor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>, Bedlam Houses seem rather specialized, seeing as Freaky Fred is committed to Home for Freaky Barbers. Clearly, the treatment at the place (if there is any) doesn't take, and security there is a little lax, as he escapes shortly before the start of the episode.
</li><li> Wanda/Scarlet Witch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> was abandoned at one of these by her father, Magneto when she was just a child. As a result, all she can think of after being broken out is getting revenge on him only to have her memories altered by the end.
</li><li> The Crazy House for Boys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> definitely fits this trope, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">men in white coats rushing into a school, grabbing an 11-year-old kid and throwing him into the back of a padded truck</a>.
<ul><li> And the worst part? Teachers get two free passes a month to have kids sent over there at their own discretion.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Ranch" featured in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> episode "The Last Resort" turned out to be a Bedlam House for teenagers designed to break (and I do mean <em>break</em>) their spirits<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3unlz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3unlz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3unlz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They would stand for long hours listening to the owner demean them and say he is their only hope for being better. And if people act out, they get sent to "Iso" which is isolation to the extreme. No light. No sound. Alone in the dark. Most end up breaking in it after a short time. Bruce claims the treatment is the sort used in cults and on prisoners of war.</span> Fortunately, Terry gets involved when one of his friends is sent there by her father. At the end of the episode when Terry exposes The Ranch's horrors and frees the teens, said friend understandably refuses to forgive her father for sending her there.

<ul><li> Scientologists believe that <em>every</em> mental hospital on the planet, without exception, is like this. Their front group, the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, is dedicated to "educating" the public about this fact. (And the fact that psychiatrists caused 9/11 and the Holocaust.) Their solution to this is to close them all down and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">replace the entire mental health industry</a> with the wonders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>'s "tech".
</li><li> Many psychiatric hospitals in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">Soviet Union</a> were these. Especially ones where they kept dissidents. Some still are. The Soviet government considered everyone who disagreed with Communism (i.e. them) to be mentally ill (after all, Communism is the wave of the future and scientific truth, so only the mentally ill could reject it, right?). These 'hospitals' were deliberate brainwashing facilities where they would send priests and other people they didn't like in an attempt to break them with torture and turn them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">atheists who worshiped the Soviet system</a> - they were the real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Room101">Room 101</a>. Most were diagnosed with the made-up disorder of "sluggish schizophrenia", something unique to the Soviet psychiatric community, which all psychiatrists elsewhere rejected.
<ul><li> There is a sharp distinction between <em>neurosis clinics</em> and <em>psychiatric clinics</em> in modern Russia. The former is a modern humane institution, where the potentially curable patients with minor diagnoses end up. The latter is the old Soviet bedlam where everyone else gets shoved into.
</li></ul></li><li> Many "Teen Treatment" facilities are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.heal-online.org/cedu.htm">systematically<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/rough-love-6336423">abusive<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The most infamous of them was Tranquility Bay. They finally closed it down after multiple lawsuits in 2009.
<ul><li> It should be noted that many of said "Teen Treatment" facilities and places like them are deliberately built in areas outside of government jurisdiction so they can blatantly commit their abuse without fear of retribution. States that don't provide adequate oversight and regulations for the treatment of minors are also prime targets for these programs.
</li></ul></li><li> Poveglia Island, located in the bay of Venice, housed a Bedlam House which was directed by a lobotomy-enthusiastic doctor. Before that, it was used for dumping thousands of terminally sick people (most of them suffering from the Black Plague) there to die. Unsurprisingly, it is rumored to be one of the most haunted places in Europe.
</li><li> China has "Video Game Addiction Clinics". The treatment is, pardon the sick irony, like Arkham Asylum. Electroshock? Check. Beatings? Definitely. Murder? Yes. Murder for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">TOUCHING THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR</a>? Yep. Check them out <a class="urllink" href="https://www.motherjones.com/media/2015/06/chinese-internet-addiction-center-photos/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Due to improperly trained and supervised personnel and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a> applying to the patients in the minds of many, abuse is quite rampant at <em>many</em> mental institutions, and serious injury and death are not uncommon - regardless of the patient's age, the patient's illness, what they <em>thought</em> the patient's illness was, or what led the personnel to, er, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">use the more severe restraining techniques</a>. There's a "psychiatric survivors" community of people who barely survived their brush with institutionalization, often with PTSD, brain damage from medications they didn't need, or both. A positive experience <em>is</em> more likely than it was 100 years ago... but that doesn't mean that <em>anything</em> you've read above is by any means rare, or only limited to countries that are not yours or are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>.
<ul><li> Lack of funding, and cutting out numerous programs, contributes to much of this. Too few staff taking care of too many patients (or whatever the euphemism of the year is) means that bad things will happen, no matter how enlightened and sympathetic the staff. There's sometimes confusion about whether or not patients can be physically restrained, and fear of punishment keeps staff second-guessing their responses to events. The causes are many, and solutions are complicated.
<ul><li> Most of the medications that are older than roughly 25 years are, well, entirely random guesses used because it <em>looked</em> like they worked. Doctors will still prescribe medications that haven't been yanked from the market purely because the <em>only</em> known treatment for their side effects is to <em>keep</em> taking them. In case this isn't horrible enough to you, try keeping up with the implications of current research — particularly the ones that indicate that not only are some forms of insanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">you getting to feel the effects of your brain dying</a> or something equally pleasant but that any cure (not counting prevention) will be horror of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">different flavor</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> If you're disabled and mentally ill, the behavior of the doctors can be worse.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, while Bethlehem Royal is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>, it was also one of the first subversions. In the 19th century, the director and surgeon were hauled up before a medical board and summarily dismissed. The new regime focused on occupational therapy and integrating the patients into society — although this was admittedly made easier by the fact that the "incurables" were now being sent to Broadmoor Criminal Asylum, which was the old Bedlam but more so.

She took a false identity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">convinced people she was insane</a>, and was sent to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Woman's Lunatic Asylum</a> on Blackwell's island. It turned out to be a cruel place where the inmates were often freezing, due to too little clothing, were abused and teased by the nurses, and were fed incredibly poor food. Nellie also found that there were many other women there who were just as sane as she was, who had been sent there because they were sick, poor or had lost their temper, and now couldn't leave as no one would listen to them (notably, one woman was admitted because they could not be bothered to get a German interpreter). When she finally was able to leave, after 10 days, <a class="urllink" href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/bly/madhouse/madhouse.html">Nellie published the account of her time in the asylum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, causing a major overhaul of the system.

It used to be a treatment center for incurable diseases during the early part of the 1900s, but it was actually run by a con man who purposefully sought out rich families with ailing elders. He would trick the families into checking their sick family members into the hospital, where they would never come out, periodically forcing them to write to their family to ask for more money. Some of them would die and the deaths would go unreported, and letters would still be sent to the family asking for money as if they had never died. Needless to say, the hotel is reportedly very haunted.

</li><li> The Beatrice State Developmental Center in Beatrice, Nebraska was <em>supposed</em> to be a caring facility for the state's mentally disabled. They carried out forced sterilizations as recently as 1966, didn't bother with anesthesia if the patients needed dental treatment because "these people don't feel pain", allowed male staffers to have intimate contact with female patients, and ignored injuries to the patients. In one year during the late 2000s, there were over 100 proven cases of abuse and neglect. They were averaging one medication error <em>per day</em>, and federal experts said they were giving the highest doses of psychotropic drugs they'd ever seen (double the recommended level in some cases) and overusing restraints. The center lost its Medicaid certification in 2009, which finally got some reforms in place.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School">Willowbrook State School<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">Staten Island</a> was an institution for children with intellectual disabilities that was open from 1947 until 1987 when it was shut down by the state for <em>very</em> good reason. By 1965, it was 50% over capacity, holding 6,000 people instead of the 4,000 it was built for. Senator Robert F. Kennedy called it a "snake pit" and compared the living conditions, unfavorably, to those of a zoo. Geraldo Rivera, then just a reporter for a local news station, did an exposé on the place titled <em>Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace</em> that won him a Peabody in 1972. The horrors of Willowbrook inspired the passage of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980.
</li><li> Sadly, the existence of places like this tends to overshadow the existence of mental hospitals that are actually effective and compassionate towards its patients. This is one of the reasons that mental hospitals are so stigmatized: because of outdated stereotypes that are less common than the <em>good</em> mental hospitals which are typically ignored by the media. The legacy of this trope, in fact, is a major reason why the US has such a mental health crisis: when many such hospitals were shut down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, newer, more humane ones weren't established to replace them, causing many mentally ill patients to be dumped out in the street and often winding up homeless or in prison. It's been <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/">said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the <em>de facto</em> largest mental health facility in the US is the Cook County Jail in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>, where a third of the inmates suffer from psychiatric conditions and new staff members are trained to deal with them accordingly.

By the 1980s, the hospital had a reduced population due to changes in the treatment of mental illness, and some patients were locked in cages.

Within fifteen years' time, however, Thorney Towers was more populated than the town itself. Houston, either driven insane by the Psitanium or by the huge responsibility over the many patients, committed suicide by jumping off of the highest tower. The asylum seems to have been built on a high point above the town, because when the government flooded the town to prevent further settlement, creating Lake Oblongata, the asylum remained standing. It has been abandoned for years, yet some of the residents still remain (even after being paid by the federal government to leave)." data-video-id="n4nwqw" data-video-media-sources="VideoGame/Psychonauts" data-video-rating-count="2" data-video-thumbnail="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/839436881_640x360.jpg?r=pad" data-video-title="Thorney Towers " data-video-trope="Main/BedlamHouse" data-video-tropename="Bedlam House" data-video-troper-rating="" data-video-url="https://player.vimeo.com/external/379389182.sd.mp4?s=babb5c79e5a746c2e7d8889e2eab7c64ce4de67c&amp;profile_id=139&amp;oauth2_token_id=1043337761" data-vimeo-id="379389182" href="#video-link">
