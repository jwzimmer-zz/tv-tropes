That being said, protesters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Occupy movement</a> have sometimes provided free healthcare systems which can include mental health care. Presumably a therapist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">must show some form of solidarity to be trusted</a>. This trope could also be justified if the hero is a superhero since confessing to a therapist about their problems could potentially lead to the therapist guessing the superheros identity, which is something that the superhero would obviously feel quite uncomfortable about. Of course, the solution for this would be to consult another superhero who is also a therapist or something close enough to it in their civilian identity (like Marvels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk">Dr. Samson</a>, for example, though hes more of a Psychologist/Psychiatrist than a Therapist) for the sake of professional courtesy and privacy, but the problem is that they tend to be extremely rare...assuming they exist in the specific superhero universe where the story takes place, of course.

This trope is very much prevalent in Japanese culture, where mental health issues are heavily condemned and discriminated against.

</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru">All Rounder Meguru</a></em> as part of a critique of Japanese beliefs in stoicism over therapy.
</li><li> Lampshaded in an episode in the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>. When Ken (who joined after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>, having been the most insane villain they'd faced yet - yes, surpassing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a>) suggests that Wormmon talk to a therapist about his problems, Wormmon asks why <em>he</em> didn't talk to someone before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">becoming the Digimon Emperor</a>?

</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> series feature characters who clearly have flagrant psychological issues that are inexplicably overlooked so long as they are good pilots, which naturally never lasts for long. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> uses it as a jumping-off point for its own story about depression and abuse. In this case, the therapists don't exist because nobody who would create an organisation like NERV is either (a) particularly concerned with the well being of their employees, or (b) particularly sane themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Kaji</a> comments "Those kids are our last hope, who knows what they're going through?"

He comes out of it reasonably well-adjusted, considering, and remains friends with his therapist.
</li><li> Averted twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em>.
<ul><li> Marika is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans girl</a> in middle school at the cusp of puberty. After her voice starts breaking, with encouragement from friends, she comes out to her mother and asks to visit a therapist. After briefly staying home from school she returns living as a girl.
</li><li> After the death of her daughter Ryousuke's mom has been in poor mental health. To help her Ryou began dressing up as his sister. Eventually, his girlfriend catches him and gets him to explain why he's crossdressing. When she learns the truth she tells her parents who get Ryousuke's mom care for her problems. Ryou is sent to live with his dad but later he sees his mom in the hospital, who is recovering well.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/QQSweeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/QQSweeper">QQ Sweeper</a></em> this is averted and discussed. Cleaning only takes care of the symptoms, not the problem, and victims who have been infested are given counseling and therapy so the negative energy stays away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>. Subverted with Dr. Bianchi, whose job is to keep the cyborg girls functioning and advise their handlers how to handle them, but not to help the girls re-enter society.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in the original series. Kayaba did not create any sort of therapists for his death game, but the AI he programmed to design most of the world realized the players would need <em>something</em>, and so created a secondary program to fulfill that purpose. But Kayaba didn't want anything interfering with his players, so he quarantined the therapist program off where it could observe the players but not interact with them in any way. It eventually managed to escape and took the form of a young girl named Yue, then got herself adopted by Asuna and Kirito. She still occasionally demonstrates her therapist abilities, such as easily pushing someone she just met towards confessing her feelings for someone and quickly identifying various deep-seated issues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline">Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online</a></em>: Karen could probably use a therapist due to her body image issues, but the big one is Pito. She is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> who is <em>upset</em> that she missed getting trapped in the SAO death game, and is obsessed with having real consequences to the games she plays. For a while, she was mostly fine since she had found a masochist to exercise her sadism on but eventually she relapsed and decided she'd kill herself if she died in the game. Karen even lampshades that if Goshi thinks she's going to kill herself he should go to the police or a therapist, but he brushes it off.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdensZero">EDENS ZERO</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Hermit</a> was used, betrayed, and abused horribly by a man who had presented himself as a kindly old scientist who wanted to help a planet full of androids, only to reveal himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> with a genocidal hatred against humanoid machines. While the scientist and his cronies are eventually arrested, by that time Hermit herself is an emotionally broken shell of her former self, and instead of offering any sort of support or therapy to help her get through it, the officers on the scene simply declare that she's too far gone and that the most merciful thing is to simply let her go off on her own to find a place to die. This being a Hiro Mashima work, it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> from the protagonists before she starts to recover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> On the one hand, it's specifically mentioned that counseling is standard for any children of roughly middle-school age. On the other hand, their quality varies, and it seems that after a certain point visiting them is optional.
</li><li> Katsuki Bakugo's powerful Quirk gave him a huge superiority complex that the adults in his life did nothing to fix. He at least is a mild example; just spending time at UA, surrounded by people nearly as powerful as him, gives him important lessons in humility.
</li><li> Shoto Todoroki's mother scarred him with boiling water in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness">Moment of Weakness</a> over her abusive husband. While <em>she</em> got sent to a mental institution that is doing great things for her (an aversion), Shoto and his siblings were left alone.

Of course, in his case, it's justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was "rescued" as a child by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">All For One</a> and raised in isolation to brainwash him to All For One's purposes</span>.
</li><li> Himiko Toga is a result of the "varied quality" of counselors. Her Quirk gave her an obsession with blood, and rather than finding some way to control or manage it, the counselor and her parents told her it was disgusting and to hide it at all costs. Eventually, the stress of suppressing such a key part of herself caused Himiko to snap, and she went on a murder spree. If she had access to an even slightly competent psychologist as a child, she likely would have grown up entirely differently.

The heros themselves are almost never shown getting psychiatric help despite the vast majority having some serious emotional baggage.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> v2 #2, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> murdered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a> and went insane with guilt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a></em>: Averted. After she was tortured, she went through counseling to help overcome the trauma, and the fact she's undergone therapy first-hand sometimes comes up when dealing with other troubled heroes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em> we see a gang member interviewing individuals begging for admittance to their shelter in the hopes of protection, shelter, and sustenance. One of the people being interviewed is a therapist, who finally sums up his profession thusly, "I help people who don't like each other get along." The gang member's eyes light up and he grins happily, "Oh yeah! We need that!"
</li><li> Completely averted in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmandaWaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmandaWaller">Amanda Waller</a>, despite her ornery and manipulative behavior, actually made sure Belle Reve Penitentiary had a full staff, including scientists, therapists, and even a priest, who were important side characters in the first half of the series.
</li><li> Despite the apparent lack of them in the movieverse, Dr. Aphra of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StarWarsDarthVader">Star Wars: Darth Vader</a></em> series is mentioned to have seen one as a child who diagnosed her with psychological problems as a result of her estranged relationship with her father and the trauma of the Clone Wars. Didn't really seem to do her much good considering the company she keeps.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, therapists probably <em>do</em> exist to help the kids deal with the fact that their parents were evil and one of their friends betrayed them, but the team avoids them due to their distrust of authority figures. This comes back to bite them in the ass in the last arc, as the team's long-simmering psychological issues all boil over and create a chain reaction that breaks them apart.
</li><li> Used egregiously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015">The Vision (2015)</a></em>; when the Avengers learn that Victor Mancha is a drug addict whose addiction has grown to the point that he's stealing from them in order to feed his habit, instead of getting him any counseling, they blackmail him into spying on Vision and his family. To say that this does not end well for anyone is a massive understatement.
</li><li> Marvel generally tends to avert this thanks to Doc Samson, a psychologist who also happens to be a superhero (specifically, a gamma mutate, this having Hulk-like capabilities, born out of his desire to help people.)

The first subversion is that this arc retcons that the superhero community created a safe location, called "Sanctuary", explicitly to defy this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The double subversion is that <em>someone</em> entered Sanctuary, massacred all of the superheroes that were <em>in</em> Sanctuary at that moment, and stole information on all other superheroes, which includes their secret identities, recordings they did where they confessed all of their darkest secrets, and extensive psychological profiles. If the arc doesn't end with them going back to believing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TherapyIsForTheWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TherapyIsForTheWeak"> Therapy Is for the Weak</a>, it'll be a miracle.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It gets subverted even harder due to the fact that the so-called "Therapist" was a computer program containing the so-called best qualities of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, who apparently thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">that was enough to counsel multiple heroes and villains instead of finding doctors and therapists with actual qualifications</a>. Even worse, Sanctuary's methods included keeping its patients isolated from one another and using virtual reality chambers to relive their respective traumatic moments. Lagoon Boy re-experiences the Titans East massacre <em>over 300 times</em> in what is clearly an attempt at self-harm until he basically grows numb, but the computer makes no effort to stop doing this despite the effect it's having on him. It eventually reaches a point where Sanctuary's abusive ineptness is <em>exactly what caused all the deaths</em> when weeks of isolation and degradation made Wally West suffer a nervous breakdown that accidentally unleashed a burst of energy killing everyone around him. By the end of the series, no point is made about any of this and the Trinity keep Sanctuary running exactly as it did before, never once acknowledging the damage it caused.</span>

Granted, they're still really eccentric, but they still seem to be more mentally stable compared to the Autobots, who probably don't have any therapists of their own (and probably don't even want any) and are no doubt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, megalomaniacal or just plain nuts as a result.

The main character is an officer of the Public Eye (basically privatized police force), who has his family gunned down in front of him, <em>and</em> the perpetrator gets away without any kind of meaningful punishment due to being mega-rich. After that, he has to go through mandatory psychiatric evaluation, and the psychiatrist actually gets suspicious because he seems to be adjusting <em>too well</em> to the situation.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicExLibris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicExLibris">Magic Ex Libris</a></em> where every Porter sees a therapist, and the therapist is a major character.
</li><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Room" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Room">Room</a></em>. When Ma and Jack escape, the police take them to a private psychiatric facility and they both receive plenty of counseling. Dr. Clay, their therapist, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShrink">The Shrink</a> version 3 and a well-developed character. This doesn't happen in the film; they just get dumped back in Ma's childhood home with nothing more to be said.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em>. In Will of the Empress, a character comes back from war and opens up about his traumas, and his sister firmly tells him that they'll be taking him to see a "mind healer", and recites the symptoms of PTSD at him, showing that there is at least some knowledge of mental health in the Emelan universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllTheTroublesOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllTheTroublesOfTheWorld">All the Troubles of the World</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted Trope</a> for humanity, because Multivac is not only providing answers to trivial questions, it also answers questions about emotional problems, and citizens are encouraged to share their innermost feelings as if Multivac was a dear confidante. However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played straight</a> for the machine itself, because nobody can help it deal with problems. The stress of being humanity's therapist makes Multivac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">want to be destroyed</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic">Schooled in Magic</a></em>: In this world, a wizard who's mentally unstable does his damnedest to <em>hide</em> it instead of seeking help, because anyone <em>else</em> would suspect that the instability was a result of necromancy.

<ul><li> Up to then, however, this was played straight among the heroes of Brockton Bay (while being averted in the world at large) - while making the above request, Weld calls out his superiors for <em>not</em> having any sort of psychiatric help already in place.
</li><li> For obvious reasons, villains tend not to seek out therapists, and for equally obvious reasons there aren't many therapists who are willing to deal with villains who could decide to attack them at any moment. Combined with the fact that many capes have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">serious psychological issues already,</a> this helps to explain the prevalence of villains in the setting.
</li><li> Completely averted in the sequel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward">Ward</a>, as the main cast first gets together in a group therapy session
</li></ul></li><li> There are no therapists in Middle-Earth of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. Therapists <em>do</em> exist in the setting, but to get access to them you need to sail with the Elves beyond the circles of the world into the Undying Lands where the gods live, and so everybody who even briefly carried the One Ring over the course of the saga eventually joins the elves in sailing west to get the help needed to overcome the trauma of having carried the Ring. Mortals with non-ring-related trauma, such as Denethor's anguish at losing his son and stress over the war, go wholly unaddressed.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em> series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">MindHealers</a> are a thing, but they're consistently incompetent at seeing that Herald Trainees - teenagers with newly-awakening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> who often come from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> and are being trained to serve as agents of the Crown - get so much as five minutes of therapy. When dealing with Talia, they fail to give her therapy <em>or</em> psychic training, and her Gift goes out of control - a situation which the Dean later says "will go in the Records for sheer wrongheadedness."

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Some police procedural and military-themed series try to avert this trope with special episodes focused on the main characters being forced to attend mandatory counseling sessions to determine whether they are fit for duty.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> has the unique distinction of being both a standard procedural and an arc-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCyberpunk">Post-Cyberpunk</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeDrama">Crime Drama</a> series at the same time. When Reese goes to therapy in Season 4 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as part of his police detective cover identity</span>, his therapist is unable to properly treat his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> because of the secrets he has no choice but to harbor. Also of note was the first therapist ever shown in the series; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he isn't a therapist at all but is instead a psychopathic hacker in a cover identity.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> suffers badly from this, especially in Season 2 and <em>especially</em> where Fitz is involved. Despite suffering from brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation, and what seems to be a total breakdown following all the trauma he experienced during and after Season 1, Fitz appears to be receiving <em>zero</em> help other than having his physical ailments kept from worsening. The fact that he's clearly experiencing vivid hallucinations, having increasingly violent mood swings, and generally withdrawing into isolation and madness is viewed with helpless sadness by the rest of the team, who can apparently do nothing other than watching him wander around the base in his own little world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>.
<ul><li> While he does make a miraculous recovery by the end of Season 2, the lack of treatment for Fitz's underlying mental health issues does actually come back in Season 5. With reality warping around the Lighthouse, Fitz begins hallucinating again but mistakes his visions for literal fragments of the other world, leading to him doing some arguably quite terrible things in the belief that his "Doctor" persona from Season 4 is a separate entity outside of his control, and not (as turns out to be the case) himself acting out the questionable impulses of a secondary personality.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> for the show as a whole (though not in a way that ever directly assists the team...) when it turns out that May's ex-husband Andrew was a psychiatrist.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E4BeautyAndTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E4BeautyAndTheBeasts">Beauty and the Beasts</a>", when Buffy was sent to see a school counsellor...only for him to wind up dead in the same episode. Buffy goes through <em>a lot</em> of shit that would mess anyone up for life; killing demons for a living, her entire relationship with Angel (which was at best emotionally abusive, and at worst dived right into stalker territory which she thought was perfectly OK) which lead to a lot of issues with Riley, her mother's illness, dying and coming back to life, her mutually abusive relationship with Spike... Yet she never got any counselling or therapy. The only reasonable excuse is that no one would believe her and think she's crazy (and considering she actually got put away by her parents at one point for trying to come clean...) but they didn't even <em>try</em> to find someone who knew about the demon world or may have even been half-demon themselves. Giles was employed by a whole organization of people who could've easily found someone to help.
<ul><li> Not just Buffy. The entire Scoobie Gang needed therapy at one stage or another. The entirety of season six could've been avoided if they'd actually sought out counselling.
</li><li> They try to avert this again in season seven when Buffy becomes a school counsellor. But considering everything she's been through without getting any help and not exactly dealing with any of it in a responsible manner (e.g. having rough sex with Spike and beating him up in the previous season), it really doesn't work. She's simply not qualified, both professionally and mentally. The teachers and principal were savvy enough to minimize the number of students who visited her; the job was really just a cover for keeping the local Slayer on retainer.
<ul><li> Buffy is not exactly such a bad choice in this instance. The principal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> knows that Buffy is a Slayer, so giving her a position as a staff member at the school would be a good way to root out any Hellmouth problems that will occur</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>. After Beckett is shot in the season 3 finale, she visits a therapist repeatedly over the course of the next season and it actually helps her a lot.
</li><li> A surprising aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum">Continuum</a></em>. Mostly, there's an implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles">All Therapists Are Muggles</a> in play; the protagonist is from the future, so if she tried to talk about her problems, she'd get locked in an asylum. That's exactly what happened to another time traveler (though in fairness, he really was crazy, as evidenced by the fact that he didn't see anything wrong with chatting about being from the future). The aversion comes into play when Kiera strikes an officer in anger, and she finds out that her cybernetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AugmentedReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AugmentedReality">Augmented Reality</a> implant has a therapist AI <em>built-in</em>. He's briefly an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTherapistsAreMuggles">All Therapists Are Muggles</a>; he doesn't believe that they're really in the past and assumes she's had a psychotic break, but when he can't contact headquarters, he tables that issue and moves on to her real problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted with Diane between seasons 2 and 3, where she actually checks in to a sani- <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">health spa</a></em> after her particularly vicious break-up with Sam, and meets one Dr. Frasier Crane (when she loses her temper and tries to smash an old lady's head in for cheating at croquet). Later on, though, two characters who saw her at the "spa" are alarmed Diane got out so <em>early</em>... also averted with Sam, since Frasier actually manages to help him kick his alcoholism.
</li><li> Frasier himself, and his girlfriend then wife Lilith Sternin are a walking aversion of this, though Frasier does grumble about the others trying to scull psychological advice from him, and whatever help Lilith usually gives is in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>. Of course, later on in the series it's shown Frasier has his own issues he's not dealing with regarding his dead mom. Another running gag is Frasier dropping with varying levels of subtlety hints to Cliff Clavin that he see a shrink, either for his morass of mommy issues or his conspiracy theories.
<div class="indent"><strong>Frasier:</strong> You know, Cliff, electroshock therapy only <em>sounds</em> scary...
</div></li><li> Cliff does try getting therapy for his obnoxious tendencies, but the doctor quickly starts abusing him because of his insufferability.
</li></ul></li><li> Valence from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DansUneGalaxiePresDeChezVous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DansUneGalaxiePresDeChezVous">Dans une galaxie près de chez vous</a></em> is there to avert the trope as the crew's psychologist, the crew just sees her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxHorrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxHorrific">therapies as worse than their trouble</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E1TheEleventhHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E1TheEleventhHour">"The Eleventh Hour"</a>, it's averted regarding Amy Pond: after she met the Doctor as a child, she ended up getting sent to four psychiatrists because she refused to claim that he wasn't real. And she bit all of them.
</li><li> Played every which way on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted in some instances—Susan Lewis sees a therapist after losing custody of her niece to the sister who abandoned her, Doug Ross sees one (offscreen) after one of his one night stands ODs and dies in the ER, Carol Hathaway refers to seeing one after her suicide attempt (and was probably required to as a condition of returning to work).
</li><li> Subverted in one episode in which Luka Kovac appears to be talking to a therapist before it's revealed that she's a prostitute
</li><li> But otherwise played straight with other characters and patients—Hathaway tries to get boyfriend Shep to see a psychiatrist to deal with his PTSD, but he outright refuses to go, or even admit he has a problem. Hathaway, as a result, breaks up with him. And numerous other characters never mention seeing one despite the considerable upheaval in their lives and how badly they're dealing with it.
</li><li> Often, the ER doctors will try to get patients who obviously need psychiatric help admitted to the psychiatric department (or psych, as they call it) only for these patients to be turned away for various reasons. These patients inevitably either come back, having harmed themselves or others, or turn up dead. Most notably, in the episode Be Still My Heart, Lucy and Carter call for a psych consult on a schizophrenic patient but are kept waiting long enough for the patient to have a psychotic break and stab both Lucy and Carter, ultimately killing the former and permanently damaging the latter both physically and psychologically—and while he sees one while in rehab, there's never any mention of him continuing to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>. Ross sees one when he's struggling with anger issues and both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">Chandler</a> and Monica mention that they've been to therapists and even discuss it in one episode.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chandler:</strong> I hate having to see the shrink. He's always "oh, maybe people will like you better if you like yourself better". Who needs that? <br/><strong>Monica:</strong> You do! <br/><strong>Chandler:</strong> I know.
</div></li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> when Astrid confides to Olivia that she regularly sees a shrink because no sane person could deal with all of the things they have witnessed without accepting help. Olivia is not as open to the idea, largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicateTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicateTheMedium">because of trust issues.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: Yara truly loves Theon, but when he still has PTSD when they're in Volantis in Season 6, she tells him that if he doesn't want to live he should just kill himself, or he should keep going  though she does apologize for being a little insensitive. This might seem kind of blunt to us, but in the behind-the-scenes videos, the showrunners directly explained that "Yara isn't a trained psychotherapist", most people in Westeros don't really know about PTSD and the Ironborn, in particular, are more blunt than others, so they felt that it would be untrue to her background if she wasn't kind of blunt in this scene.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Garo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Garo">GARO</a></em>'s first season, and justified in the sequel. When Kaoru dreams about her father's picture book at the start of the series, she regularly visits a therapist who helps her to explain these dreams, and helps her with the weird things she suffers since discovering the existence of Horrors. The justified during the second season comes from the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the therapist was actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first season and tried to sacrifice Kaoru to bring the end of the world</span>, which explains why she may not have the desire to try therapy any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em>: While there aren't any therapists because no one is supposed to need one, there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient">Janet</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Janet:</strong> Well, my job is to make your experience here in the afterlife more enjoyable, so I will try to help you.

<ul><li> Judy, the oldest child, suffers a traumatic event early on that leaves her with severe PTSD for two episodes. While psychotherapy is not among the talents of the Robinson family, her father, John, who is a military veteran, offers her emotional support. However, she rejects it, partly out of resentment towards him and partly out of a fear of looking weak. Instead, she gets over her trauma by saving herself from yet another dangerous situation, not something generally recognized as a treatment in the professional field.
</li><li> Dr. Smith poses as a psychologist as part of her cover story; she offers counseling sessions as a means of worming her way into the other characters' confidence and learning their secrets. Worse, at one point she uses this scheme to intentionally manipulate a character into violent behavior by exacerbating their trauma.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em>: Averted with Misty Knight. After roughing up Claire due to her near-death at the hands of Diamondback, Inspector Ridley makes her sit down with a competent police psychiatrist, and he gets her to admit her problems and deal with them.
</li><li> Completely averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, in which Sidney Freedman is a recurring Type 3.

This is maybe a thousand years before therapy was even invented. In fact, Merlin himself may have had to invent therapy out of necessity to deal with everything he goes through. He's basically taken on the role of therapist to all of his friends (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> as to why he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">grows more manipulative and darker over the series</a>; he shoulders A LOT of baggage).
</li><li> Normally played invisibly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>. Despite all the dysfunctional crap the family goes through, no one so much as implies some sort of professional help is needed. Not until Alex, stressed over a test, snaps at her own birthday party. The next morning, her parents are trying to figure out what to do (once again not even considering therapy), when Alex walks up and explains she's already found a psychiatrist with good reviews who is covered by their insurance, and she's scheduled an appointment with him later.
<div class="indent"><strong>Phil:</strong> She's like a self-cleaning oven...

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, where there have been multiple instances of characters meeting with the town therapist, Dr. Hopper, to talk out their issues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSmoke">The Smoke</a></em> starts out with firefighter Kev Allison being injured in a fire and the child he was trying to save dying. It's suggested that Kev see a therapist after all he's been through, and at first it seems like he is, but then the therapist turns out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a>. (The fact that attending therapy wasn't outright required in the first place given everything he'd been through seems odd).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> tried to avoid this somewhat by instituting the position of "Ship's Counselor", but still ran into it on occasion. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> had excuses though: Ezri Dax was still in training when she was assigned as counselor, while Captain Janeway said in an early episode that <em>Voyager</em> hadn't been expected to need one (being that the mission they were <em>supposed</em> to have took place well within shouting distance of a major starbase, Deep Space 9). Chakotay (with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest">Vision Quest</a>), Neelix (as Morale Officer), and Tuvok (using Vulcan meditation techniques) usually take up the role.

Josh attempts to shrug off his issues and deflect painful questions by being deliberately irritating and difficult, but Stanley is completely unfazed by his aggression and (after eight full hours of circling) gets him to admit that he didn't cut his hand on a glass as he previously claimed, but<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarm">broke a window in his apartment during a flashback</a>. Stanley diagnoses him with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> PTSD</span>, and tells Josh that he is not and will never be 'cured', but he can get better and recover over time.
<ul><li> Josh and Leo later have several vague conversations about Josh's PTSD, and two years after the incident, Donna calls Stanley to inform him of a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shooting at the White House</span> because she is worried about Josh's mental health, indicating that he is recovering, but is not the same as he was before.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite having both been sober for years, Leo and Hoynes continue to regularly attend AA meetings, emphasizing that addiction never goes away and has to be managed no matter how long you have been sober for.
</li><li> After she is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> seriously injured in a bombing</span>, Donna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is extremely heavily implied to have PTSD</span>, confirmed when Kate pulls her aside to ask how she is doing and offer to talk if Donna needs to - she doesn't force anything on her, simply volunteers her help.

She'll ask him if he has ever sought professional help. He replies that he hasn't because he <em>killed</em> all his therapists.
</li><li> Key to the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kinder">Kinder</a></em>; a running theme is that 'mind illnesses' are not recognized as a real problem in its world, instead attributed to things like "they're just lazy" or "they're just complaining for no reason." Naturally, this causes major problems. Yuuichi eventually states that there's probably worlds out there were 'mind illnesses' actually <em>are</em> recognized and treated more seriously.
</li><li> Interestingly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastDoor">The Last Door</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NightInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NightInTheWoods">Night in the Woods</a></em> plays with this trope. There is indeed a therapist on Possum Springs, however, said therapist is also the only doctor in town, so he fills in roles of every medical field for the people in the town, including also orthodontist. The result is that he, while acting as a therapist for the town, is lampshaded by characters to be incompetent at it, with people who go to see him getting none of the treatment they actually need. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mae was one of those people.

And that is not to speak of Yuuki Terumi and Relius Clover, who not only are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">mentally unsound</a> (Terumi moreso), but go around making everything <em>worse</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">This might have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">the justifications</a> in the way that compared to its predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> (which draws heavy influence in American music), Blazblue is <em>very</em> Japanese-themed, not only its anime influence but also Japan's real-life cultural aversion on psychology.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>, quite a few characters are pretty obviously in need of somebody to help them deal with their post-traumatic stress. For example, Miles Edgeworth witnessed a murder at the age of nine after being trapped in an elevator in an earthquake and is shown to have panic attacks in earthquakes even as an adult. He also avoids elevators whenever possible, a major inconvenience considering he works on the tenth floor of a building.
<ul><li> Ema Skye also qualifies. She <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> witnessed a murder</span> at fourteen, and is still shaken from it two years later.

In the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, Gilgamesh exploits this by telling Kotomine to embrace it, leading to where he is in the present.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, as pop-psychologist Dr. Lipschitz and his assorted parenting manuals make frequent appearances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: At first characters would go through one-episode events caused by old traumas or mistakes and not have it commented on, to the point that several villains had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuses</a> that only got so bad because there was no one to help them. However, mental health improves over the course of the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Princess Celestia</a> tasked one of the main characters with reforming a villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess">Princess Cadance</a> is known to reignite couple's love, and Twilight Sparkle helped to rehabilitate a former cult leader. Even the B-plot Cutie Mark Crusaders have moved into the field of cutie mark advice — and given that ponies consider cutie marks a huge part of their identity, that can be considered some form of therapy. Perhaps most importantly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSacredDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSacredDarkness">Princess Luna</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">visits ponies in their dreams</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">especially foals</a>) and helps them work through whatever problems are giving them nightmares. Note that the villains with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuses</a> all suffered their trauma long before Luna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">was freed from being Nightmare Moon</a>, and we see several foals who could have easily gone in the same direction without her help.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>, Hank Pym fakes his death, then goes around with a new personality and calling himself Yellowjacket, who is much more ruthless and prone to violence. Everyone is aware that is unhealthy but no one mentions therapy.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, "Webworld", was all about the Decepticons finally getting sick of Galvatron being insane and sending him to a planet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">whose hat</a> is curing the mentally ill. Galvatron just ends up ravaging the planet.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>. The second season episode "Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?" reveals that shortly after Donald found himself raising the triplets, he began attending anger management in order to keep his temper from hurting the kids.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em>. Although initially mistaken for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, over the course of the series, it becomes more and more clear that TKO is born not of evil, but of psychological problems, and is essentially an embodiment of things which KO refuses to accept about himself. Nobody comments on the fact that the kid has multiple personalities (which are indeed vaguely reminiscent of Dissociative Identity Disorder), nor do they suggest that he get help - KO instead deals with this on his own, with mixed results. The repressed anger issues which are a major part of what TKO resulted from <em>are</em>, to some extent, addressed - his mother tried to teach him ways to deal with said anger when he was younger, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his disregarding those methods is more-or-less the reason why TKO exists</span> - but nobody helps with or talks about his issues much beyond that. Luckily, unlike with most real cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">KO manages to undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">Split-Personality Merge</a> at the end of the series, without any further help</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: in the final season of <em>Future</em>, Steven has to confront all the various insecurities and problems that have been boiling up to here along with some new ones. He suffers from post-truamatic stress disorder from the dangers his life has been, he's been suffering an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExisentialCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExisentialCrisis">Exisential Crisis</a> as he no longer has to be the one to help solve people's problems and has gotten out of touch with his human side as everyone moves on with their lives. It becomes increasingly clear to everyone he needs help, but he's afraid on confronting it. Therapy is recommended by Priyana after his first ever visit to a medical professional after his powers have begun manifesting and changing beyond anyone's knowledge (though it's an implication that they are responding to his emotional distress.) His refusal to admit he's <em>not</em> fine manifests and only in the finale when he accepts this, he begins to heal. He even notes he's seeing a therapist virtually.
