</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> was widely worshipped as the Asgardian God of Thunder he truly is (as well as war, strength and agriculture) by the Vikings and various other Scandinavian and Germanic peoples for about a couple of thousand years. He actively encouraged said worship by personally appearing on Midgard (Earth) before the Vikings most notably, spurring them on the victory in battle in his and Asgard's name. But when Thor later discovered that many of the "battles" some Vikings engaged in were actually raids and the wholesale slaughter of religious (usually Christian) orders of holy men, Thor denounced the Vikings' actions, renounced their worship, and returned to Asgard, not returning to Midgard until Odin exiled him there under the guise of Dr. Donald Blake to learn humility.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Luna and Celestia</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights">Under The Northern Lights</a></em>, especially Celestia, who says she outlawed the worship of herself centuries ago in Equestria.

</li><li> Celestia and Luna again in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RealityChecksNyxverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RealityChecksNyxverse">The Nyxverse</a> — as they explain in <em>Alicornundrum</em>, they originally tried to avoid worship when they were younger, but ponies insisted on it. Eventually they got so fed up with it that they fled into the Everfree, sealed themselves in the Tree of Harmony cave, and put themselves in a magical sleep, hoping that when they woke up everyone would have forgotten about them. Instead, they woke to found that their followers had found them, dug them up, and <em>built a castle on top of them</em> (according to Celestia, Luna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">invented half of the curses existing today</a> when they saw this). They use this as justification for making Twilight a Princess against her will; she's going to be worshipped anyway, they might as well make it official.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMLPLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMLPLoops">The MLP Loops</a></em>, Celestia politely asks Twilight and company to stop swearing by her since they're effectively equal. They swear by trees instead, and it's not just the Looping version who feels this way - in one loop, an unAwake version of her learns about a Loop where her and Luna's Awake selves were angels, and also frequent and passionate speakers in support of atheism. The unAwake Celestia, writing back, promptly asks Twilight if they could start an atheist movement in Equestria.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/198011/blessing">Blessing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a story set in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TriptychContinuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TriptychContinuum">Triptych Continuum</a></em>, Celestia tries to convince a stallion whose daughter is dying that she is not a deity and thus cannot save his daughter no matter how much he prays to her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When his daughter dies anyway, the stallion merely blames <em>himself</em> for not having enough faith.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a></em>, Celestia, while she <em>is</em> an actual deity, isn't comfortable with the adoration and the separation it puts between her and her little ponies...on the other hoof, Luna is perfectly fine with it.
</li><li> Upon her ascension, Sunset Shimmer of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OversaturatedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OversaturatedWorld">Oversaturated World</a></em> finds that an entire religion is developing around her, complete with holy images and competing sects. At first she tries to stop it, but eventually grows resigned and just throws up a Ewetube channel to direct their worship.

Their relationship with their god is intimate, yet formal: it will lend its power to them in the form of magic, but they only call on it on very special occasions as they do not believe they should bother their god with things they can do themselves.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">Belgariad</a></em>, the god Aldur has no worshipers, although he does have disciples.

Belgarath made it very clear this would only manage to offend Aldur.
<ul><li> Because there were seven peoples created for seven gods, and Aldur chose to live alone, one of the peoples went godless and separated into several factions. The leader of one of these factions went to the top of a mountain to speak to UL, the father of the seven gods, and ask for a god to lead his people.

This was caused by the monk Lu-Tze renting one of Mrs. Cosmopolite's rooms, writing down her various sayings, and quoting her to explain his feats.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> setting. The Lady of Pain's response to worship is either to banish the offender to a nearly inescapable maze, or simply kill him. It's mainly because her city, Sigil, is a god-free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone">Truce Zone</a>, and due to the setting's laws she will actually become a goddess if enough people believe she is one.

<ul><li> It wouldn't be enough normally, but according to <em>Pages of Pain</em>, she's a daughter of gods and thus is ready to become one herself.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Reapers'</a> general reaction to the (heretic) geth who view them as Gods. They tolerate the worship since they have need for geth assistance for now, but don't do much to hide their contempt for it. Their disgust is partly due to the superstitious nature of such worship and the fact these geth also believe they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalEvolution">can become more like them</a>.

</div><ul><li> Although it was already serious, this gets an explanation that's even more dire in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Reapers were created in response to the "cycle" of species creating AIs which warred against them (like the geth). They are imbued with the "essence" of a particular species, as seen in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, and see themselves as the true descendants of that species — therefore they think of themselves as a sort of organic life, not synthetic (it is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">twisted logic</a> that makes them see their "harvest" as <em>not</em> an AI warring against organic life).

If you cause too much trouble in her city, she will banish you to another dimension, or kill you outright. If you WORSHIP her, she does the same thing. It's never fully explained why she detests being worshipped, when most beings of her power would gladly accept it. (more info in the Tabletop Games folder)
<ul><li> It may have something to do with the fact that Planescape runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>.

<ul><li> Another possibility relates to the fact that Sigil is a no-go zone for gods, for various reasons, and the Lady is charged with both maintaining the city and keeping gods out. If she were to become a god, she would vanish in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">Puff of Logic</a>, and possibly take the entire Planescape-setting with her.

Unfortunately, due to his sticking around to help mortals adjust to Gielinor, not to mention welcoming all of the original humans (and elves, and gnomes, and fairies) to come to Gielinor in person, lead them to worshiping HIM. He was not amused, and decided to go take a nap for a few thousand years so everyone could forget him. Then the God Wars happened, and everything got screwed up.
<ul><li> That isn't even considering his allowing Seren to stick around with her elves. Then again, Seren is one of TWO Gods that still whole-heartedly care about their worshipers (Armadyl is the other).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum">Arcanum</a></em>, it's well known that the hero Nasrudin became revered as a Messiah figure and protector of the world by the Panarii religion, after defeating the legendary evil known as "Arronax". What's less well known is that after the battle, Nasrudin retreated to the Isle of Thanatos to recuperate and regain his strength, then returned to the mainland. When he discovered the Panarii and they way they worshipped him, he was so disgusted that he turned around and headed back to Thanatos.

Merill and the other Dalish elves have no idea what Flemeth is (nor does anyone else, really), but they know that she is <em>not</em> someone you should piss off. While Flemeth does appreciate the respect, she feels they go a little too far. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flemeth is actually Mythal, one of the deities of the Elven pantheon</span>, making her distaste for worship even more poignant.

Osiris himself found the Followers more annoying than anything, seeing himself as a scientist, not a prophet, and dismissing them as a bunch of lunatics. Unfortunately for him, his open scorn wasn't enough to dissuade the Followers, and their attempts to advertise his beliefs was one of the big contributors to Osiris getting exiled, making him hate his worshippers even more. In the present day, the Followers are still around and still fanboying over Osiris, who seems to be doing everything in his physical power to keep them away from him.

With the reveal that the Nora's supposed "goddess" GAIA created Aloy to save humanity from HADES, the Nora Tribe are quick to bow to Aloy as "All-Mother's Anointed One". Having been treated as nothing but a curse by them her entire life, this only makes Aloy angry, seeing this as nothing but the unwelcomed opposite extreme that it was, shames them for it and demands that they stop bowing to her.	</p>
