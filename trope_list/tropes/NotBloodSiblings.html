Usually, for all intents and purposes, everyone acts like they are. Alternatively, it can be used to explain why everyone's okay with the relationship.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This can also be foreshadowing for such a relationship, as many shows usually won't make a big deal about adopted children unless there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy">Changeling Fantasy</a> involved.
</p><p>Sometimes this is a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerization</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, in that in the original series they were blood relations. It also comes up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a>, for fans who, while probably not having siblings, still feel a bit too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">First Girl Wins</a> can sometimes explain the prevalence of this trope.
</p><p>This trope is often related (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun">not by blood</a>, of course) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings">Flirty Stepsiblings</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleSisterHeroine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleSisterHeroine">Little Sister Heroine</a>.
</p><p>As for reality, it depends. These tropes tend to gross out anyone who has been raised alongside their stepsiblings. If they met as teens or later, though, it can seem unfair that their parents got together before they did.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In older works, when sex shouldn't even be hinted at in family-friendly stories, main child characters are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">conveniently adopted orphans.</a> That way, the main male and female character don't have to be accounted as their actual parents. This situation does lead to a lot of confusion with readers. A boy and a girl are adopted by a family, therefore appear to be brother and sister, but still have a romance thing going on and jealousy when one of them has success with another love interest. Since the situation isn't always explained, this often leads to disturbing, confusing ideas with the readers.
</p><p>Therefore, in such cases, the story adaptations usually omitted the siblings relationship and the characters almost never treat each other as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>, so as not to cause unpleasant associations in more conservative times. Not to mention the fact that thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, even the relationship between non-native siblings or foster parents was considered a real incest for religious and moral reasons. In that case, this trope will be an anachronism within the story, if it takes place in a similar setting.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Quite often it's just a case of cultural misunderstanding. In Japanese the words for "big brother" (兄さん - <em>nii-san</em>) and "big sister" (姉さん - <em>nee-san</em>) are very commonly used in casual speech to address young people in general, too, and it's not rare that little kids and teenagers will use them to address older but still young friends (or love interests). However, sometimes clarification is needed if the context is not clear enough about it.
</p><p>For when "siblings" are by choice, instead of blood, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice">Family of Choice</a>. Also, do not forget that the ever-growing number of imouto-titles has practically translated this trope into the category <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt">Like You Would Really Do It</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal">Captain Obvious Reveal</a>, so even its well-founded use can very quickly get into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a> is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxInterracialRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxInterracialRelationship">Faux Interracial Relationship</a> is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">Maligned Mixed Marriage</a>.

</li><li> Heavily zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoriYuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoriYuki">Alice in Murderland</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction">Stella</a> has been infatuated with Zeno since before they were both adopted into the Kuonji family as children, because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">shielded her</a> from debris in the plane crash that killed her parents. Her feelings carry over well into adolescence, when she eventually discovers that her beloved Zeno-nii <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isn't the same Zeno who protected her, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">took his place</a> when the real Zeno died in the brutal pre-adoption selection process. Then it turns out the real Zeno was rescued and raised in secret by the family butler, Kokonoe, under matriarch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Olga's</a> nose, and both he and his impostor who grew up with Stella have feelings for her. <em>Then</em> it turns out Zeno was never real, but a more confident, outgoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> of the real child, Tsukito, who was originally too timid to meet Stella without using Zeno as a front and didn't tell her the truth to spare her feelings after meeting her for real. Stella is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">unable to choose</a> between Tsukito and the fake Zeno, and Olga finally reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Tsukito</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">her biological child with Kokonoe</a>, making him Stella's sibling as well. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark">Distinguishing Mark</a> that should prove Tsukito's parentage isn't found on him, but on <em>Stella</em>, leading Kokonoe to reveal that Olga unknowingly gave birth to twins. While this would implicate Tsukito, Kokonoe goes on to reveal that the twins were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">Separated at Birth</a> and Stella's twin brother eventually died of illness, while his heart was transplanted into Tsukito.</span>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">The Kuonji family</a> is forbidden to procreate, instead surviving by adopting several orphans at once and raising them as siblings, eventually forcing them to compete in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleRoyaleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleRoyaleGame">Battle Royale Game</a> with the last surviving child taking over as head of the family and repeating the cycle in time. The new head is granted the opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">revive one sibling</a>, who will more often than not become their spouse and rule the next generation by their side. Olga is revealed to be the particularly brutal winner of her generation who chose to revive her favourite little brother (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully">terrified of her</a> well before the battle royale) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">marry</a> him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">against his will</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>, where the protagonist Setsuna goes and gets a blood test to see if he's related to his sister Sara, whom he lusts after, just for the possibility of this trope occurring. They're 100% blood-siblings, but it doesn't stop them from getting together.
</li><li> In the manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ani-Com" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ani-Com">Ani-Com</a></em> by Yuu Yabuuchi (writer of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaishoNoTsubomi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaishoNoTsubomi">Naisho No Tsubomi</a></em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shojo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shojo">Shōjo</a> manga), this is the basis of the plot. It's played out that the remarrying parents <em>expected</em> their two children to get together and get married, and they do.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hiro and Karada</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou">Asatte no Houkou</a></em>; not taken to a romantic end, but still important to the plot. It's implied in the manga (but left unmentioned in the anime) that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while not siblings, they ARE blood-related, but Karada never knows (she would be the daughter of Hiro and his aunt conceived just before he went to study in the US).</span>
</li><li> Eren and Mikasa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> than some examples, since his family took her in when she was already nine. While Eren doesn't seem to have any romantic feelings towards Mikasa, Mikasa loves Eren to the point that she's willing to die for him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">Everyone Can See It</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a>:</em> In-universe, it's rather unclear how countries are "born" and form physical "relations" with one another, but a few sibling pairs have been confirmed to be unrelated by blood, including:
<ul><li> Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
</li><li> China and Japan; notable in that the status of China's other siblings<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06te1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06te1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06te1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, and Korea</span> are ambiguous as to if they're related to China by blood.
</li><li> America and England is a special (and odd) case: When America was a child, England <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">adopted him</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">younger brother</a>, but during the American Revolution, the teenage America declares that he's "not [England's] little brother anymore."
</li><li> Averted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Norway and Iceland</span>the latter's "DNA testing results" (archaeological excavation) prove that they are, in fact, related.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Binetsu Kuukan</em> features a classic example of the trope with new teen step siblings Amane and Naoya. They almost immediately fall for each other, and their respective friends and passersby already think that there's something romantic going on between them. The only barrier between them is their new living arrangements.
</li><li> Kai and Saya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em>, where it is pretty obvious from early on in the series that Kai would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">hit that like the fist of an angry god</a>. Nobody seems to find this at all strange. When one considers that she was only "adopted" a couple of years ago (ie after Kai had hit puberty) and looked like a teen girl already, it's not so strange.
</li><li> Interesting variation in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuNoFutatsuNoTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuNoFutatsuNoTsubasa">Boku no Futatsu no Tsubasa</a></em> when Hiromi gratuitously reminds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">Makoto</a> (after a lot of borderline incestuous behavior) that they aren't blood <em>cousins</em>, it foreshadows the reveal that Hiromi's adoptive mother is Makoto's biological mother, meaning they aren't blood sisters, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em>:
<ul><li> Defied, as one of the reasons why Yukari and Daikichi don't end up together is to avoid this trope.

He only sees her as a sister, which ticks her off. He is willing to kiss her, but only because it is the way to seal her out of control powers. When facing his biological sister Mana, Kotori actually used this trope to an advantage: since they're not blood sibling, Kotori can marry Shidou, Mana can't.

</li><li> Played with in the light novel series <em>Isekai Konyoku</em>, with the hero being summoned to another world in his own body and later discovering that his biological sister had been resurrected into this world in a new body, resulting, as he puts it, in her being his blood-related-yet-not-blood-related sister.
</li><li> In the Okazaki Tsuguo manga <em>Justy</em> the titular character has <em>two</em> of this sort of sisters (the older one "adopted" him when she found him as a lone child, and then he "adopts" the younger after he kills her criminal ESPer father), and they both have crushes on him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Justy ends up romantically involved with the older one, Jerna.

Naturally, his little sister Kei is cast as the step-sister with a brother complex who lives alone with him while their parents work overseas.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shirogane:</strong> Yeah that's definitely a red flag. Why hasn't anyone called child protective services?
</div></li><li> <em>KissXsis</em> runs on this trope. Keita's twin stepsisters compete with each other for his affections, much to his dismay. His parents not only are aware of this, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">actively encourage him to go for one of the girls</a>, constantly reminding him that "it's not by blood, so it's OK!"
</li><li> In the OVA adaptation of the bishoujo game <em>Ko-ko-ro...</em>, Souji is shown in flashback to be adopted by the Kuonji family. This is apparently not lost on his younger sister, Asuka; though she addresses Souji as "Aniki" (Japanese for "older brother"), she regularly initiates intercourse with him and secretly watches him having sex with other girls in his bedroom.
<ul><li> When in public, Asuka is openly affectionate and quite clingy with Souji, acting much more like his girlfriend than his sister, and seems to relish the shocked stares of people who see them together.
</li><li> The OVA scenario is about as shocking as in the revised version of the game, in which Souji and Asuka were merely stepsiblings, but neither is as shocking as that of the original release of the game, where they actually <em>were</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">blood siblings who had sex with each other</a> and were also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">sexually abused by their parents</a>.

The story revolves around how they copeor notwith the fact that they can't get over their feelings for each other. In fact, <em>Koi Kaze</em> uses the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction">documented phenomenon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of "genetic sexual attraction" as a factor in Koshiro and Nanoka's interactions.

The very first day, a girl speaks to Shougo through a high window, claiming to be his biological sister and that she's going to marry him, but she refuses to give her name. Shougo, not wanting to marry a blood sibling, thus has to find out which go the many girls clamoring over him is the one who spoke to him through the window. The original Light Novel series finally reveals that Konoe, the girl who'd spoken to him, is indeed Kumagoro's biological daughter, but Shougo is <em>not</em> his biological son, and they end up together. The anime, on the other hand, ended before the novels did, leaving things up in the air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">hitherto unmentioned</a> Kanako, Keitaro's quasi-adopted sister. Ironically Keitaro is the <em>only</em> character who never rationalizes Kanako as being 'fair game', while Naru ends up taking his role of clumsy awkward relationship handler for a period of time because she does.

This is used quite blatantly so Sakura can be obsessively fawned over by her new guardiansand eventually fall in love with one of themwithout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>.
</li><li> Pristine example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Miyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Miyuki">Miyuki</a></em>: The main character soon discovers that his stepsister Miyuki is not blood-related to him.

Within a few days he falls in love with his new big sister and does his best to protect her, but she's kinda clueless and never gets a hint. Keith's new adoptive mother ends up being won over by him and tries to get Katarina's engagement annulled so that Keith can marry her instead, but has no luck.

"If the Master says there is a cute little non-blood related sister, there IS a non-blood related sister."
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OniiChanDakedoAiSaeArebaKankeinaiYoNe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OniiChanDakedoAiSaeArebaKankeinaiYoNe">Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne!</a>!</em>.

Only in the last episode is it revealed that Akiko's been, for the sake of his sister, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">keeping his adoption a secret all along</span>.

</li><li> The animated adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic">Pop Team Epic</a></em> features a parody of such stories, titled <em>Don't Call Me 'Sister'!</em> (Or IMO YOBA for short). Heroine Iyo Sakuragi and her popular crush Hojo are suddenly made into siblings due to their parents (Pipimi and Popuko) remarrying each other, and the story follows some typical plot beats of the pair trying and failing to be a regular family. Their problem, however, lies not with each other, but <em>their parents</em>; eventually Iyo gets so fed up with them that the story takes a turn for the violent.
</li><li> None of the Elmore kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren">Psyren</a></em> are blood-related. Probably why Fredrica and Marie is one of the most common pairings.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>: when Nanami thinks that she and Touga <em>aren't</em> blood siblings, her world collapses.

Mitsuki finds this disgusting and humiliating, constantly managing to force Hiyori out of her body. However, as time goes on, she starts fantasizing about and blushing around Yuya even when Hiyori is not there, and getting jealous of any girls that get close to him. Yuya is confused about the whole thing, thinking Mitsuki has a split personality.

It's mentioned that Suguha's parents are actually Kazuto's aunt and uncle, who adopted him into their family when his parents died in an accident, meaning that he and Suguha are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">first cousins</a> rather than true blood siblings.

After that, he breaks up with Wendy to date his previous foster-sister Vanessa instead, while being implied to still live in her house. It's weird.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>, it is hinted at in the comic, and expressly stated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, that Cutter and Skywise have had sexual relationships. It is also mentioned in the comic that they are "brothers in all but blood." Of course, the elves are said to not have the same concept of relationship as (modern Western) humans do, even though nearly all of them are paired in "life bonds" (i.e. marriages).
</li><li> Mister Immortal from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatLakesAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatLakesAvengers">Great Lakes Avengers</a> learned he was immortal after his foster sister's death, which became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmtastic</a> after his repeated botched suicides.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a>'s "true love" is his adoptive sister Amanda Sefton, even though they were raised together since infancy. They actually did officially get together, late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a>'s</em> original run (and was portrayed as a bad ideanot because of their prior relationship, but because Amanda was portrayed as not-quite-right in the head). Nightcrawler (as Mystique's blood son) and Rogue (as her adopted daughter) have potential for this, as well. Which if it happened would be less potentially squicky than Amanda; they never even met until adulthood. He still flirts shamelessly with her.
</li><li> Back in the early 1980s, DCU stories set on Earth-Two hinted at the mutual attraction between the Huntress (Helena Wayne, Earth-Two Batman's daughter) and the local version of Dick Grayson. It pretty much remained subtext, with both parties insisting all too earnestly that even though they weren't biologically related, their relationship would be too wrong to even contemplate. That subtext inexplicably became text in the recent <em>Justice Society of America Annual</em>. The 1980s version was from the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">Earth Two</a>. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, that Universe ended.

It was found that Wiske was the strongest character of the cast and to give her more emphasis Rikki was replaced by Suske, an orphan Wiske and Sidonia met on their next adventure and who joined their family. Very, very, very few comics handle differences in their lineages and for any casual reader, Suske and Wiske appear siblings by blood. This caused a lot of disturbing scenes where Wiske is jealous of Suske's success with other girls and a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> appeared to be going on.

She ends up as the third person in Shirou's harem, after she kidnaps him and takes him to her castle for some "alone time."
</li><li> Similiar to the Thor and Loki example above, there's room for debate as to whether shipping John and Arthur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> counts as incest. We know John was taken in by the gang when he was twelve, so he was at least a preteen when him and Arthur met (and thus already past several formative years), but that doesn't change the fact Arthur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">played the role of a big brother</a> for a good amount of time. They refer to each other in-game as brothers a few times as well, though often begrudingly. Most fanworks make it <em>very</em> clear the two didn't develop feelings for each other until John was well of age, at least- and others simply put them into an alternate universe where they didn't meet until they were both adults. Also worth taking into account is the fact that Dutch's gang was anything but conventional in terms of societal values and taboos.

</li><li> Fan works pairing up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Human Child and Asriel</span> could fall into this, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asriel's parents try to take care of the Human Child and offer to adopt them as well</span>, and accepting the offer is the most popular ending with fans.

<ul><li> There are constant debates on who, if Scar and Mufasa are the lions of the Pride, Nala's father might be, and thus to what extent she is related to Simba. A full-on sibling seems unlikely, but she could easily be the daughter of Mufasa and another lioness; barring this, she may be the daughter of Scar, which is uncomfortable for <em>several other reasons</em>: in some drafts (and in the Broadway musical), Scar actually tries to make Nala his consort, which is the real reason she exiled herself from the Pride. You see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad">what the problem with that is</a>. Moreover, in the sequel, Nala and Simba's daughter Kiara hooks up with Scar's adopted son (well supposedly, see the third bullet-point here), which is just as weird. According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>, Nala's father is an unknown male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">who died or disappeared in unknown circumstances prior to the events of the films</a>. Some fans have been reluctant to accept this explanation (as well as other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retcons</a> done by the series) and declare it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a> altogether.

This was a last-minute change as Kovu was originally Scar's biological son with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">Strong Family Resemblance</a> before the writers realized the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">minor case of incest in point</a> (some dubs even still keep them as cousins).

Then, as they are living together in the same house, a teen romance gradually develops between Ana and Otto into a full-blown sexual relationship which, however, they manage to keep completely secret from their parents/stepparents to the end. Curiously, the possibility that the relationship between two opposite-sex stepsiblings could ever go beyond familial love never does seem to occur to either of their parents/stepparents or much of anyone else, which is why the two are able to conceal their nightly liaisons from them so easily.

Ator, the titular swordsman, falls in love with a woman whom he <em>thinks</em> is his blood sister; when he asks their father permission to marry her, the father happily reveals that he is in fact, adopted.

Interestingly, Anderson had originally intended for this to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a>, based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow">real-life friend</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">in love with his own sister</a>.

Still, it's a bit <em>odd</em> given that he still considers Mel his father, even calling him "Dad" in his first scene.

</div></li><li> Subverted in the 1991 French Film "Toto le Héros" (Toto the Hero) The main character is convinced as a young boy (about 10) that he was switched in the hospital with his neighbor shortly after they were born. He uses this to rationalize his crush on his sister. They may or may not have done anything sexual at that age.

Interestingly, Nemo is shown to have three love interests and Anna is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">depicted as being the right girl for him</span>.
</li><li> In the 1955 French movie <em>Le fils de Caroline chérie</em>, Conchita knows that Juan was adopted at a young age and uses it to rationalise her feelings for him. However, Juan doesn't learn this until a third of the way through, and the youngest sister Pilar doesn't learn this until the end of the film... and they're quick to jump to talking about marriage after this reveal.

This means that they're legally the adopted siblings of the Chipmunks while still being their love interests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bushwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bushwick">Bushwick</a></em>: This is apparently the case with Lucy and Belinda, as Lucy explains to Stupe that they were both raised by Grandma, meaning they're sisters in that way. As neither looks anything alike (Lucy is white, Belinda most probably a Latina) they likely aren't even half-sisters.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em> (1818).

At least kind of; Elizabeth was raised by Victor's parents, but there seems to have always been a kind of barrier between the two thinking of each other as siblings, probably because their family always <em>wanted</em> them to get together as adults. Note that they may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">biological cousins</a> depending on which edition you read.

On the other hand, it's been speculated that (like many "wards" of the era) he might really have been an illegitimate son of Catherine's father, which would make them half-siblings.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>'s novel <em>Big Trouble</em>. Matt and Jenny fall in love throughout the events of the book, but when their parents get together, they decide it's just too weird and break it off, but remain close friends.

Granted, "small children" here is about ten, at least in Harry's case, which is more than old enough to avoid feeling like brother and sister.

It's awkward, but that apparently doesn't last long, and they're promptly back together. Which is okay, except for the fact that they're living in the 18th century and hence have the appropriate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSexualFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSexualFreedom">awkwardness</a>.

James's crime novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathInHolyOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathInHolyOrders">Death In Holy Orders</a></em> featured a half-brother and sister who discovered each other's existence as adults and start a casual sexual relationship. The sister, in particular, behaves as if it's no big deal, and makes the excuse that it's not like they're <em>full</em> siblings. Of course.
</li><li> The Cullens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>though all the "children" met as adults, and weren't raised together.
</li><li> In Elizabeth Peters' book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLoveTalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLoveTalker">The Love Talker</a></em>, the main character Laurie is aware of un-sisterly feelings towards the half-brother with whom she did <em>not</em> grow up and in fact barely knows. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She eventually learns that her supposed brother is actually an adopted child.

The best example of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CutlerSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CutlerSeries">Cutler Series</a> where Dawn learns that she's actually adopted and that Jimmy is hence not really her brother; Jimmy even expresses his relief about this as he was attracted to Dawn even when he thought they were related. (And just to top this all off, Dawn's original boyfriend Philip turns out to be her <em>actual</em> brother who remains obsessed with her after the truth of their relations comes out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">absolutely creepy levels</a>. Got to love VC Andrews' wacky plots.)

Making it especially squicky, they have two mutual half-siblings from his father's marriage to her mother.
</li><li> Shaun and Georgia in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Newsflesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Newsflesh">Newsflesh</a></em> series. They're adoptive siblings and did consult a geneticist to be <em>sure</em> they weren't blood relatives.

Romances between foster-siblings aren't considered anything out of the ordinary and are often encouraged, as it makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> that comes after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">a lot easier</a> to go through with. Kids are usually neonates by the time they're fostered out, and view their foster-siblings as peers and friends, not siblings:
<ul><li> Petyr Baelish played "kissing games" with both his foster-sisters, Catelyn and Lysa Tully. He eventually fought an (unsuccessful) duel for Catelyn's hand<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later married Lysa, though Cat was the one he truly loved.</span>
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister invokes this deliberately by sending his 9-year-old niece Myrcella Baratheon to live with her fiancé, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">11-year-old Trystane Martell</span>, years before they will be old enough to marry.
</li><li> Quentyn Martell mentions that there was a general expectation that he would marry his foster-sister, Gwynth Yronwood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't, but it would probably have been better for him if he had</span>

</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest">Villainous Incest</a> couple who actually produced a child in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em> were considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">siblings</a> by the culturemarriages consist of one man, maybe two if they're lucky, and a band of sisters who are themselves descended from sisters, and all offspring from this marriage are considered to be siblingsbut genetically are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">cousins</a>. The social consideration overrode this trope and the couple was regarded with disgust and horror regardless of genes. The trope itself was used to point out that their child wasn't as poorly off as she could have been.
</li><li> In the <em>Hetty Feather</em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquelineWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JacquelineWilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a>, Hetty's most consistent love interest is her former foster brother Jem. In the final book, <em>Emerald Star</em>, he proposes to her and when she protests that she is his sister, he tries to convince her that they are allowed to love each other because they are not blood relations. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hetty rejects him anyway as she is leaving to join the circus.</span>
</li><li> In the young adult novel <em>Cluing In</em> by Jo Ramsey, main character Jamey Mandel's parents, Tamara and Sam, are stepsiblings; Tamara's father Victor is married to Sam's mother Martha. Somewhat subverted in that Tamara got pregnant with Jamey (at age 17) before she and Sam realized their parents even knew each other, and before Martha got pregnant by Victor. Victor and Martha got married before Tamara and Sam did, though.
</li><li> Things get very complicated in Ursula K Leguin's "O" short stories: the people of O have four-person marriages called <em>sedoretu</em>, but because humanity is divided into two categories (moieties) which you inherit from your mother, each man is only allowed to sleep with one of the women (and vice versa)your partner must be from the other moiety. If you're a child of one partnership, the children of the other are your "germanes", and when you grow up, you're allowed to marry and sleep with your germane (who, after all, isn't even a half-sibling, but will have grown up living in the same house). A full brother and sister can also marry, but they won't be in the same sexual pairing as they'll have inherited the same moiety from their mother. Whether or not it's considered appropriate to marry your germane or sibling seems to vary depending on where you live. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>if you concentrate.

By the time they got married, Jackie opened the episode by saying, "I can't believe our little Darlene is marrying... our little David," Mark scolded David for asking about their birth parents when the Conners were practically his parents, and David and Darlene paid tribute to "<em>our</em> parents Dan and Roseanne Conner" in their wedding vows.

Chad who is biracial comes to town and eventually dates Whitney, the daughter of Eve and TC (the only black family in town). Chad is for several years hinted to be the son of Eve and her white lover Julian from before she was married. Later Chad and Whitney have a baby together and the revelation comes out that they are half-brother and half-sister and their baby was born from incest. Later it's revealed that Chad is not really Eve and Julian's long-lost son. It turns out Julian's father Alistair had raped Eve's adopted sister, so Chad's son is not a product of incest - but on the other hand, Chad himself is a product of rape. Even later it is revealed that Chad is having a gay relationship on the down-low with a guy named Vincent... who turns out to be Eve and Julian's hermaphroditic long-lost child for realsies this time... oh and he's a serial killer and a rapist to boot.

Perhaps in an attempt to lessen the potential squick factor, it's explicitly stated by Joe that Barry had a crush on her before he came to live with them and watched Barry be in love with her before he knew what love was.

</li><li> To a lesser extent is the genderbents of the vocaloids (i.e. Mikuo, Kaiko, Gakuko, Luki, Ted); the fandom can get away with pairing them up because they are simply gender reversals of the official vocaloids and therefore are not canon siblings.

<ul><li> Fans frequently debate whether a relationship between the PC and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Imoen, both Children of the dead god Bhaal</span>, would "count" as incest. Those who favor the relationship usually point out that the PC is often a different race from her, and that canonically they are known to not have the same mother so that their main connection is definitely not any mortal source. (This is even brought up in the expansion <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> in a discussion between her and one of the other party members; Viconia suggests she should serve the main character in every way he desires for all that he's done for her, and why it shouldn't be a problem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Imoen</span> balks at the thought and finds the idea disgusting... and then turns the question back on Viconia, who's also been canonically saved twice by the protagonist and <em>is</em> a romance option). Ultimately irrelevant, as she isn't a romantic option in the game... unless you mod it.
</li><li> The same argument is made for the female PC and Sarevok, who are also Children of Bhaal from different mothers. It's a little easier to defend, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Throne of Bhaal</em> makes it clear that Sarevok no longer has the Essence of Bhaal, and that was how he was related to her</span>.

Not too long after this, Shirley confesses to Senel that she is in love with him. They presumably end up engaged via the Rite of Feriyen by the end of the Main Quest... although afterward, the other characters note that the relationship between them doesn't seem to have changed much at all (they even get new titles to reflect this; Senel obtains "Still A Brother" and Shirley obtains "Sister Girl").

<ul><li> This is presumably what was intended with Two-Tone and Lucky in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatiansTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatiansTheSeries">101 Dalmatians: The Series</a></em>.

It's most likely the creators of the cartoon mistook Two-Tone for one of the adopted puppies.
</li><li> Once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a>,</em> Roger tricks Steve into believing that he was kidnapped from another family, causing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">kiss his supposedly-unrelated sister Hayley</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Roger:</strong> Everything that happens from this point is just gravy.
</div></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a>,</em> the title species lives in large clans that are considered to be a single familynobody keeps track of who their biological parents are, and thus all gargoyles of the same age group refer to each other as their "rookery brothers/sisters" and older members as their "rookery parents." Their mates are usually rookery siblings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that real incest never occurs, though, because a) each female can only lay one egg per mating cycle, so rookery siblings never include <em>actual</em> siblings except in the rare case of identical twins from the same egg and b) pheromones prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Kissing Cousin</a> relationships.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> has implications of this. Suyin says multiple times Kuvira was like a daughter to her, though she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">never really shows it</a>, and Kuvira is engaged to one of Suyin's biological sons. It's never specified if Suyin adopted Kuvira or not however it's implied she was raised alongside her family from a young age.
</li><li> While Adora and Catra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> were raised from early childhood by the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Evil Mentor</a> whom they both saw as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">maternal figure</a>, their relationship has always straddled the fuzzy lines between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friends</a>, rivals, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">love interests</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the series, they become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a></span>.
</li><li> An odd example: in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a>,</em> Homer's father briefly dates Marge's mother. Homer is against their relationship since he believes this will make him and Marge siblings, and retroactively turn the kids into freaks "with pink skin, no overbite, and five fingers on each hand!" The two wind up breaking up, though. However, Marge later becomes Homer's <em>aunt</em> when Abe briefly marries Selma. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon">even weirder</a> when you take his relationship with Mrs. Bouvier into account...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>: Lance and Ilana, masquerading on Earth, pretend to be brother and sister at their high school. There's plenty of "moments" between them. When Lance reluctantly agrees to go to prom as a group, he decides to invite Ilana if he has to take someone (she points out she's already going with someone). One wonders how they would explain this to the others. Also, their neighbor Barb seems disappointed when she thinks that Lance and Ilana are brother and sister rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> though intentionally wanted to avoid romance between them mainly to avoid the obvious squick potential.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>, if Babs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeciesSurname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeciesSurname">Bunny</a> and Buster Bunny didn't always say "No relation" after introducing themselves, most viewers probably would have assumed they were siblings.

Lillith then declared her intention to kill Callie and have sex with Mark in front of a stadium full of other demons.

<ul><li> At present, Japanese law allows adopted siblings to marry, which has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">feudal-era</a> origins. Japanese family inheritance traditionally emphasize the transmission of family <em>traditions</em> rather than <em>blood</em>, so at the time titles could only be transmitted to the title-holder biological or adopted <em>son</em>; even nephews needed to be adopted as an heir. This caused adoptions in feudal Japan to be as political as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>, and many just do bothadopting a child from another family as one's heir and having the latter marry his own daughter. <br/><br/>As an example: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsudaira_Katamori">Matsudaira Katamori<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, ninth and the last Daimyo of Aizu and the direct boss of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinsengumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shinsengumi">Shinsengumi</a>, is an example of this <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Kissing Cousins</a>. He was born the seventh son of Matsudaira Yoshitatsu, the tenth Daimyo of Takasu, whose biological brother (i.e. Katamori's uncle) Takakata was already adopted out and became the eighth Daimyo of Aizu. When Aizu, again, was facing the problem of a lack of male biological issue, Katataka adopted Katamori, his biological nephew, as his son and by extension, the future ninth Daimyo of Aizu. To cement the relationship between the two houses, Katataka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">arranged</a> Katamori to marry his biological daughter, i.e. Katamori's <em>first cousin by blood and sister by adoption</em>.
</li><li> The Roman emperor Tiberius married his stepsister Julia as part of his stepfather's plans to make him his heir. Given that Julia's father, Augustus and Tiberius' mother, Livia had already been together when Julia was born, and Tiberius was already 14 at that time, it's still more than a bit squicky. But to their credit, it wasn't their idea (in fact, Tiberius was already married to Vipsania Agrippina, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">whom he loved dearly</a>, when Augustus had this idea, and did <em>not</em> want to divorce her; he never got over being forced to leave her for Julia) and it didn't last long.
</li><li> A variation: prior to same-sex marriage being recognized in the U.S., some same-sex couples would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">get around visitation restrictions in hospitals</a> by having the older partner legally adopt the younger one, enabling "child" to care for "parent" or vice versa. This presented some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">complications</a> when it came time to actually get married.
