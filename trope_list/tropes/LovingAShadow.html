If this causes the writers to accidentally build things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">harems</a>, the easy way to get around this is to reveal the basal nature of a relationship. This is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishfulProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishfulProjection">Wishful Projection</a>.
</p><p>In the character's mind, one type of relationship was simply confused with another. This has some basis in reality, where some potentially romantic relationships are actually people seeking "figures". (Hell, who <em>hasn't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">done this at some point</a>?) They spend time with a person because he or she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRemindMeOfX">reminds</a> them of someone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">else</a></em>. For example, some characters attracted to older characters often have an absent parent or older sibling.

For example, Bob falls in love with Alice because she is incredibly beautiful, or a brilliant fighter, or incredibly smart, but he fails to actually comprehend Alice beyond that trait. This is easy to do to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">The Lost Lenore</a> since she's not around to contradict an idealized version of her.

All the things he is longing for are not physical but abstract things that he cannot grasp, which is why he finds it so difficult to find any way to resolve his longing. He's made efforts to move on, as evidenced by his relationship with his new girlfriend Risa, but he's as distant with her as he is with everyone else.
</li><li> In the Season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko">Aggretsuko</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Retsuko finally realizes that she doesn't love Resasuke, but rather the super-idealized version of him that only exists in her head and she breaks off her relationship with him. In the same episode, Retsuko's coworker Haida confesses his crush on her, but also admits that, despite this, he doesn't really know her that well. However, he decides to rectify this by actually getting to know her.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag">Ao no Flag</a></em>: Futaba eventually realizes her feelings for Touma arent really ones of love but more admiration for the sort of person he is and wanting to be like him which helps her realize her feelings for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taichi</span> is the genuine article.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em>: In the manga and OVA, Ryoko's obsession with Shin falls into this category. She idealizes Shin and is enamored with the idea of being in love. However, she fails to understand how he thinks, what motivates him, or how his time at Area 88 has affected him. For this reason, she's completely blindsided when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he abandons her</span> in both continuities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>: While she never confesses her feelings, Kaorin's crush on Sakaki is based entirely on Sakaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofDarkHairedGirl">superficial</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAthlete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademicAthlete">qualities</a>.

After Train defeats him, he suddenly does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and no longer has any reaction or romantic obsession with him, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">getting together with Echidna</a>. This never happened in the manga, where Creed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">goes into a catatonic state of shock</a> and is never shown getting over Train. Rather ironic, considering that the anime made Creed more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">pervertedly obsessed with Train</a> than in the manga, making this an even less justified trope.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>. Sayaka admits that she fell in love with Touko at first sight, based largely off Touko's beauty and the fact that Touko had managed to outdo her on the Toomi East entrance exam. Over time, though, Sayaka came to realize that Touko is quite vulnerable under her façade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper">although Touko didn't initially realize that Sayaka knew</a>), but rather than be disappointed, Sayaka came to love Touko for who she was.

She's hurt later on to learn that he's with her boss Sylia Stingray (more or less), after which she finally begins to bond more with the hulking roughneck AD Police officer Leon McNichol.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>: Sakura realizes that her feelings for Yukito are (mostly) familial in nature, while Syaoran's crush on Yukito is explained as "attraction of similar magic", which clears the way for both of them to fall in love with each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: This is part of the reason for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">Misa</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyrism</a>—to her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Yagami</a> will always be the handsome and heroic vigilante that avenged her murdered family, regardless of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">less</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">than</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">heroic</a> he actually is, and she is madly in love with him for that.

When this is cleared up and Kobayashi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFirstMeeting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFirstMeeting">remembered Shiratori</a> as clearly as he recalled her, they properly got together.

<ul><li> Case in point: In the second flashback of the prologue to <em>The Last</em>, when Iruka tells his students to write down the name of the person they want to spend their last day with, Naruto tells Sakura that he'd protect her, which she predictably rebuffs because she's focused on Sasuke. However, when Naruto actually thinks to himself, he admits that he doesn't have family or friends, and he's unable to write down a name. Despite his previous statement, Naruto does not think to write Sakura's name, even though he's supposed to have a crush on her in his childhood. This is an understated yet telling scene that demonstrates that his passing crush on her was non-existent and not serious.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em>The Last</em>, Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirls</a> definitely count, since they're only interested in Naruto because he's the hero who ended the war and saved the world.

Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">Hinata</a> is the <em>only</em> girl in the Leaf Village who actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll">loves Naruto for who he is and has always loved him for the way he is</a>, <em>not</em> because he's a hero.
</li><li> All of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">girls that have a crush on Sasuke</a> fall under this trope. Karin got a good look at the real Sasuke as he punched a hole in her to kill Danzo, which seemed to end her affection definitely...until it didn't. After Sasuke gave her a weak apology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Karin immediately forgave him</a>.
</li><li> Subverted with Sakura towards Sasuke.

When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn">he rejoins the good guys</a>, Sakura is able to perceive that Sasuke is not fully back to his former self yet. Nevertheless, she refuses to give up on him even as he remains outwardly dismissive and distant towards her and still seeks his acknowledgment. After she reaffirms her love and tries to reach out to him once more before his final battle with Naruto, Sasuke himself comments that they have no reason to love each other and that those are feelings from a failed past. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Following his definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Sasuke is finally able to let go of his hatred and fully reciprocate Sakura's feelings.

Either his love interests like Peter Parker or hate Spider-Man, or like Spider-Man but don't care for the Peter Parker side of him, leading few of them to really get to know the real him and be completely honest with each other:

In Tom Beland's one-shot "Web of Romance", Peter actually reflects this about his feelings for Gwen and how it compares to his relationship with Mary Jane (who's always been insecure about being a replacement for Gwen). Peter notes that with Gwen he was always tense, nervous, because of how emotional she was, was never entirely relaxed, and that he was never able to be honest and open with her in the way he is with Mary Jane, and that his feelings for his wife are greater than it was for Gwen.

When Victor Fries was a child he became fascinated with freezing things when his mother almost died after falling through thin ice. As an adult, he became fascinated with Nora Fields, a woman who was cryogenically frozen at age 23 in 1943 when she was diagnosed with a fatal heart condition. At the time she was in the care of Wayne Industries, so Fries applied for a job there just so he could have a chance to study her. He eventually became delusionally obsessed with her and started thinking she was his wife—a nasty change from his more sympathetic DCAU origin. Batman calls out Freeze on his delusional "love" of a woman he doesn't know who is old enough to be his grandmother.

</li><li> Second, she learns that Adrien <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">found out about her former crush on him when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping">overheard her and Alya</a> arguing at the museum... and not only did he decide not to do anything <em>with</em> that knowledge, he actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blames her</a></em> for it</span>. The fact that he sees <em>himself</em> as the victim in that situation proves to her beyond any shadow of a doubt that he's hopelessly self-absorbed.
</li><li> Adrien's feelings towards Ladybug, meanwhile, are another good example of this, though he fails to recognize that himself.

As a result, while he's still happier with Crowley than he is with anyone else, he can't be fully happy with a Crowley who doesn't remember what they used to be.
<div class="indent">The truth was that he found himself wishing it was the <em>real</em> Crowley who lay with him afterwards, murmuring softness against his neck, running worshipful fingers over his chest and stomach. Wishing those eyes were as gold and glimmering as they should be, wishing that smile was weighted with all their centuries together, wishing that Crowley would call him <em>angel</em>, would call him by his true name.

<ul><li> Destiny's mother in <em>Little Darlings</em> didn't really know the father of her daughter, and was caught up in a fantasy she associated with his being a rock star.
</li><li> In the first book of the <em>Girls</em> series, Ellie develops an attraction to Kevin, an older boy she has seen around town but never really met or spoken to. She later develops a relationship with Dan (a boy her own age) and has to accept that Kevin will never live up to her romantic fantasies as he is gay; however, Ellie and Kevin do form a genuine platonic friendship.
</li><li> Marigold from <em>The Illustrated Mum</em> has idolized Micky as the love of her life for years but fails to realize that he does not want anything to do with her. Micky is more interested in his daughter, Star, and is implied to find Marigold's unusual ways intolerable. Marigold got together with Michael, Dolphin's father, mostly because he had nearly the same name.
</li><li> Drives the plot of <em>Falling Apart</em>. Tina falls for the older, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">more socially advanced</a> Simon and soon convinces herself that he is the love of her life.

</li><li> Sylvie, the protagonist of <em>Kiss</em>, has grown up in very close proximity to her friend Carl.

He claims that if he were to actually have a relationship with her, she'd soon realize the illusion and kill him. This is one of the main reasons for his rejection of her (the other being that she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> with no regard for human life, who murdered his adoptive family). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, sections from the Queen's viewpoint suggest that she does love him for who he is</span>.
</li><li> The plot of <em>Almost Love</em> by Louise O'Neill focuses on this; alternating between Sarah's obsession with Matthew (whom she barely knew as a person) in the past, and her present-day relationship with a man she neglects while still hung up on her illusion of Matthew.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheseWordsAreTrueAndFaithful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheseWordsAreTrueAndFaithful">These Words Are True and Faithful</a>:</em> Sam accuses Ernie of treating him as "a blank slate onto which you could project all of your fantasies" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the post mortem on their relationship</span>.
</li><li> In <em>The Genovese Merchant's Daughter</em> by Mikhail Kuzmin, five sisters discuss their love for their husbands. Caterina loves hers for his kindness and honesty, Petronella loves hers for his painter's talent, Veronica loves hers for his wealth, Martha loves hers for his gorgeous looks, and Philomena says she loves hers no matter what and is promptly laughed at. Then their husbands get involved in a political plot, and the honest man betrays the rest, the painter loses his eyes and the handsome man gets scarred in the ensuing fight, and all of them are stripped of their riches. It's easy to guess which one of the sisters does <em>not</em> abandon her husband afterwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">Parodied</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift">Jonathan Swift</a> poem "The Lady's Dressing Room", where a young fop is traumatized to learn that the object of his adoration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeUpIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeUpIsEvil">uses cosmetics</a> to enhance her appearance and swears off romance forever when he sees proof that she has <em>bodily functions</em>.
</li><li> Often a factor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong">Jin Yong</a> novels, especially when unrequited love is involved, but it's most blatant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemiGodsAndSemiDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DemiGodsAndSemiDevils">Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils</a></em>, where Duan Yu falls in love with a <em>statue</em> before ending up gaga over Wang Yuyan, who reminds him of "her". When the story was originally in syndication, he ended up winning her over (she had an unrequited crush on Murong Fu) and marrying her, but when Jin Yong published a newer edition later in life, he had Duan Yu come to the realization that he and Yuyan were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSharingKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSharingKnife">The Sharing Knife</a>: Horizon</em> young(ish) Patroller Neeta from New Moon Cutoff who, due largely to couple of years on exchange up in Luthlia, starts fixating on Captain Dag Wolverine (Hero of Wolf Ridge) as soon as he connects him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">the epic cycle</a> she memorized. The broken amputee Tent Wolverine sent back to his birthplace in the hopes of him healing his emotional wounds, the humble patroller who literally lived for malice slaying, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> trainee groundsetter she actually <em>met</em> would all agree that the actual heroes at Wolf Ridge died there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarryOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarryOn">Carry On</a></em>, Simon thinks that he and Agatha are destined to become married and live happily ever after but he's really more in love with the idea of having something normal and stable in his chaotic life that he can rely on than with Agatha herself and she breaks up with him because she doesn't want to be just the "prize" he gets at the end of the story. Similarly, Agatha's crush on Simon's nemesis Baz is shown to be more her desperately wanting a purpose outside of "the hero's perfect girlfriend" than her actually being in love with Baz.
</li><li> One of the reasons why in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaxAndWayne">Wax and Wayne</a></em>, Marasi and Wax end up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>. Marasi grew up on tales of the legendary lawman Waxillium the Dawnshot (Wax is about twenty years older than her), and while she does get to know him better as a person, her crush on him was motivated by stories of him rather than the real him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouKnowYouWantThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouKnowYouWantThis">Kristen Roupenian's short story "Cat Person"</a> explores this with the relationship between Margot and Robert, who only meet in person a few times before they regrettably sleep together on their first (and only) date. Their brief romance is carried out almost entirely over text message, and their lack of real knowledge of each other allows Margot (and, seemingly, Robert too) to fill in the gaps with an ideal that shifts in response to stimulus over the course of the story, but in all cases barely resembles the real person.
<div class="indent">Every so often, over the next day or so, she would find herself in a gray, daydreamy mood, missing something, and she'd realize that it was Robert she missed, not the real Robert but the Robert she'd imagined on the other end of all those text messages during break.

<ul><li> Oliver and Laurel's romance seemed to be a case of this, though later seasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">clarify</a> that they <em>did</em> love each other — Oliver gave up on Laurel because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest">he felt he was unworthy of her and couldn't give her the life she wanted with him</a>, no matter how much they loved each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though Season 5 does imply Oliver's complicated feelings for Black Siren, Laurel's evil Earth-2 doppelgänger, <em>is</em> a case of this, as he is trying to find the Laurel that he loved in a woman that, while similar in appearance, is not her</span>.
</li><li> A more concrete example would be John Diggle's brief romance with his widowed sister-in-law, Carly. While they did have an attraction, it's implied that John's feelings for her partially stemmed from wanting more of a connection with his brother. That's why they broke up, as no matter how much they cared for each other, there was always going to be three people in that relationship, and they both deserved better than that.

When Caitlin calls him a monster, he flashes back to his mother doing the same with his father, right before said father killed her. This is why it's so easy for him to give up on her when she rejects him one too many times — it was a shallow attempt at forming a connection by a man who has only ever known hate all his life.
</li><li> Iris West's relationship with Eddie Thawne had shades of this. While Iris did love Eddie, it isn't hard to see that she loved Barry more — it's implied that one of the only reasons why their relationship even got as serious as it did was because Barry was in a coma for the beginning of it (the other being that Iris was painfully oblivious to her own feelings for him). In fact, it was even part of <em>how</em> they got together, as Eddie covered Joe's shifts at the precinct so he and Iris could be with the comatose Barry, and Iris decided to thank him with a cup of coffee one day — things just spiraled from there. When explaining to Iris why he was breaking up with her, Eddie straight up tells her that (much like the John Diggle example above) there have always been three people in their relationship: him, her, and Barry. And as much as he would have liked to believe otherwise, he knows that when it really comes down to it, Iris will never choose him over Barry. He just thought he could love her enough to change that.

Basically, Josh represents a time in her life when she was happier and more carefree, and Rebecca projects that desire for a happier life onto him in the hopes that getting back with him will fix her problems. Naturally, it doesn't work that way and Rebecca ultimately realizes that she has to address the real sources of her unhappiness and stop seeing Josh as a solution, especially because he has a large number of flaws himself.

Frasier later speculates that Niles may also fear being unable to live up to being in a real relationship with her. The problem is resolved when the two of them make a long list of everything they hate about each other.

Even though both of them are in their twilight years, he is still obsessed with the Femme Fatale. He uses the artifact of the week, a cursed film projector, to send women into the movie to take the place of the Femme Fatale who appears before him in the flesh. The women are forced to act out the role which ends in them being shot to death in the movie while the director makes out with the Femme Fatale. Everything comes to a head when the character convinces him to kill his wife, thinking it will allow her to exist in the real world for good. His wife turns the tables on him by faking her death and shooting him dead, coldly stating that he never loved her, only the "pathetic character [she] played." Even the Shadow itself grows disillusioned with the man since he only used her as a glorified sex toy.

He insists that because the simulation is based on the memories and feelings of a real person it is a sentient, living person despite his friends repeatedly reminding him that it is not and the woman he loves has been dead for centuries. When his simulated girlfriend gets back together with her ex, Gordon deletes him from the program, only to find that her personality has completely changed from the person he fell in love with because he essentially edited out a huge part of her life. This breaks the illusion for him, realising that she is just another program he created.

In addition, Lana calls Clark out for loving the image he's built up of her over the years to the point where he was blaming himself for her very illegal, very felonious activities (kidnapping and torture, and eventually felony murder).

</li><li> Lex's love for Lana and Helen aren't the only things that are placed in this light; many of Lex's relationships take this form. His fascination with Kara is likely due to wanting Clark to be honest with him about his alien heritage. Also, his idolization of his mother came from the years of physical and emotional abuse from his father; however, while his mother was probably too sickly to physically abuse him, she definitely could be just as vicious as Lionel was, emotionally.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">Ménage à 3</a></em>: Sonya takes up with Gary because she thinks that hes a sex god and that her sleeping with him will make Yuki wildly jealous. When Gary turns out to be a sexually inexperienced nerd, and Yuki proves too depressed to get angry, Sonya drops Gary. Which said, all that time, shes never denied that her real obsession is with Zii  which may be another, subtler instance of loving a shadow. In fact, most of the deeper relationships in the comic seem to feature elements of the trope; for example, Erik loves Zii as a cool rock chick, DiDi loves Kiley thanks to a dim-witted misunderstanding of something she said, and anyone who so much as looks at DiDi has their brain addled by lust.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NamirDeiter">Namir Deiter</a></em>, Cedric convinces himself that he's still in love with Tipper (his high-school sweetheart, whom <em>he</em> broke up with). Tipper tells him point-blank that he's in love with the girl she used to be and she's changed drastically since then. Not to mention she's engaged to someone else. Cedric doesn't take no for an answer. From Tipper OR her fiancee, Charles. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.namirdeiter.com/comics/index.php?date=20081019">It doesn't<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.namirdeiter.com/comics/index.php?date=20081021">end well<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Then again, Cedric has always been portrayed as a flake who tends to react first and think when forced to.

When Tina and Darryl pretended to be a couple, she told him how to act as her boyfriend. Afterwards, she thought shed developed feelings for him. He pointed out that shed only really developed feelings for the person he was acting like, which was him just following her instructions and nothing like who he really was.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em> does this to basically everybody who is nice to him or helps him to focus, he tends to over-idealize someone and ignore their flaws as long as they are by his side, often ignoring to even getting to know them properly. This is particularly done to Charlotte, a doe he met 20 years before the series starts a few times who was his best friend's girlfriend at the time, who left to go to Maine. He never really got to know her deeply, but grows to believe she is his last chance to happiness and wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>.

When he finally declares himself, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">Lampshades</a> this: they never were really close, they never got to know much about each other, and they haven't seen each other in 20 years, so why would she choose him over her family?</span>

Aside from her clearly not being interested in a child, she just takes advantage of him to get free expensive gifts. When he realizes that their relationship is not mutual, he stops giving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, one episode makes it clear that the titular character's mother Maddie would have never been happy with Vlad Masters, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, who use to be college friends with Jack, Danny's father, and Maddie, by showing an alternate timeline where Maddie married Vlad. Vlad is shown to be a control freak, controlling his wife's movements and preventing her from pursuing her passion in ghost hunting, while Maddie is <em>still</em> in love with Jack — who in this reality, took Vlad's place as the first halfa. This is because Vlad is in love with the <em>idea</em> of having Maddie rather than Maddie herself; hence, in the canon timeline, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">Hopeless Suitor</a> who has no chance with her, regardless of her marriage with Jack.

Rose, for her part, may not even be aware that there <em>is</em> a difference until Greg confronts her about it, which marks a turning point in both their relationship and Rose's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.
</li><li> Broken down a bit more explicitly in "Love Letters." Jamie the mailman sees Garnet rising from the ocean and instantly becomes infatuated with her, writing the titular letter and professing his love to her (in the rain, no less). After both Garnet's blunt rebuttal and Connie and Steven's attempt to let him down easy go awry, Garnet sits down with him and explains that it just isn't possible for him to be in love with her so quickly (they'd said all of two sentences to each other) because love is about knowing the other person and accepting their flaws, and he was just so swept up in the drama of Hollywo- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Kansas</a> that he had himself convinced infatuation <em>was</em> love.

By contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Marinette</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Kagami</a> were both won over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe">by his kindness</a>, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Chloé</a> has known him since childhood — all three of them, to varying extents, know the <em>real</em> Adrien far better than Lila would even want to.
<ul><li> Technically, this applies to <em>all</em> of the girls who've shown interest in Adrien, as he considers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PungeonMaster">Chat</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Noir</a> to be his true self, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurityPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurityPersonified">Purity Personified</a> image is largely cultivated to please his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father</a>.

In "Shadows of Mystacor", Shadow Weaver insists that Adora is a cunning, ruthless, cutthroat warrior who belongs with the Horde, while the <em>actual</em> Adora is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> for a very good reason. Inverted in grimly ironic fashion with Catra, where it's more like <em>Despising</em> A Shadow; Catra <em>actually is</em> the cunning and ruthless person Shadow Weaver thinks Adora is, but Shadow Weaver is focused entirely on building up Adora and she can't see Catra as anything other than a wastrel who exists solely to drag Adora down.

On some poetic level, he seems to have understood it, and plays the trope straight in the poems he wrote on the subject.
