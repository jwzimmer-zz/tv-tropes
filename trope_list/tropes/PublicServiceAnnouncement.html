<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Argentina </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Luchemos por la vida (Let's Fight for Life)'s ads about road safety have ran for so long that many of them have become catchphrases. Since Argentina has the second highest rate of fatal traffic accidents, they seem not to work.
<ul><li> "Tranqui, 120." (Relaxed, 120 km/h)
</li><li> "¡Lo que dé!" ("As fast as she can go!")
</li><li> "No dispare contra su familia" (literally: "don't shoot (against) your family"), a pun on the verb "disparar", which means "to shoot" but it's also a slang for going very fast or be catapulted (as in a car crash) when used in adjective form. That sounds like a decent and clever campaign, right? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klJ2ub-522c">It isn't.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> From the same organisation, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkTAzZxF888">in this ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a girl is telling her dad that he's driving dangerously... and then he becomes a scary mix between a monkey and Chewbacca. Pretty startling when you're young.
</li><li> There were also the infamous SITEA ads, warning about cholera or meningitis. The latter showed a creepy scarecrow looming over a cradle. Unfortunately there are no videos of them but they've left their mark.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Australia </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In general, Australian PSAs are quite notorious for their ability to shock. For some reason Australian ad agencies really don't fuck around when it comes to public safety.
</li><li> Maybe the only thing worse than being in a car crash? Surviving the initial crash...<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGMfjWwX_LU">and then being BBQ'ed.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Australian Society for Venomous Animals gives you <a class="urllink" href="https://pif.wikia.com/wiki/Australian_Society_For_Venomous_Animals_-_Valley_Girl">Valley Girl.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Try to hold your laugh.
</li><li> Three guesses why this anti-speeding ad's title is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoaGq_6UH4s">"Beach Road"/"Bring me back my boy."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And for added horror, the child actor was actually in a crash nine years later. Fortunately he survived and had his driving abilities downgraded.
</li><li> You'll never be quite able to hear the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm1JByRQRhY">12 days of Christmas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the same. Brutally effective in showing a family going from normal to living nightmare in the course of a few days; it was originally released in three parts in the days leading up to Christmas of 1998.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mgi5PszvQg">Possibly the most realistic drunk-driving video in showing the aftermath and the ER of the victim.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Nightmare fuel with a four-digit octane number. If the weeping/hysterical family doesn't get you, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mopping the child's blood off the floor should.</span> The official slogan in Australia is as follows: "If you drink, then drive, you're a bloody idiot." Most would use harsher language. The child's voice singing 'Happy Xmas' by John Lennon makes it even more horrific.
</li><li> You see this sort of thing all the time on Australian TV, and it will always end with "Authorised by the Australian Government, Canberra" or "Authorised by the New South Wales Government, Sydney" or whatever applies for your part of Australia. The most famous of these are short ads against domestic violence, which were parodied <a class="urllink" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6QnTmxwvU">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChasersWarOnEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChasersWarOnEverything">The Chaser's War on Everything</a></em>.
</li><li> A series of ads about excessive drinking shows the evening of a drinker through their eyes. In one a guy gets into a drunken punch-up and ends up badly beaten, while another sees a girl drunkenly seduced in the bushes at a party and finds people laughing at her while she struggles to find her panties. But probably the most chilling is the guy who stumbles onto the road while walking home and is fatally hit by a car—<em>in first person.</em>
</li><li> You know what AIDS is exactly like? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> going <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U219eUIZ7Qo">bowling.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (To make this ad worse, the bodies seem remarkably similar to Holocaust victims. Simon Reynolds is sick.)
</li><li> Also from Australia comes an ad, backed by a music video called <a class="urllink" href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=rDE8HvGIt2U">It's A Beautiful Day For Cancer.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Australia had some particularly chilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> PSAs. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvBKlBhfgPc">One<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed a couple eating dinner while the woman next door is presumably being beaten up by her husband. The man at the table very decidedly puts down his fork and picks up a baseball bat. He then knocks on his neighbour's door and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">hands him the bat</a>. The voiceover says:
<div class="indent">If you do nothing about domestic abuse, you might as well lend a hand.
</div></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_2M3LrfFAw">Another Australian PSA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that was regrettably pulled from the air was of notorious prison hardman "Chopper" Read describing how those convicted of abuse would be treated in prison. Very effective, since no one really thinks of prison hierarchy (or, for that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">how it's maintained</a>) when committing a crime. He mentions in the ad that he had his ears cut off while in prison, but doesn't point out (as he has in his memoirs) that he had another convict do it for him so he would be able to leave prison temporarily.
<ul><li> Another series of PSAs that "Chopper" Read did were about road safety, detailing <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md7h3giMwy0">things that happened to him in prison,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWewepI1oHE">how people hate him for being a murderer,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ending with the line that if you drink, drive, and cause a fatal accident (such as by hitting a pedestrian, the example used in both videos) you're a killer just the same as he is.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIvo-tPKYTw">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> PSA about the drug "Ice" (i.e. methamphetamine). Seriously, the girl picking at her skin.
</li><li> A particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">We're Still Relevant, Dammit!</a>-laden example is the "Don't be a Dickhead" ads. One of them says "when you drive too fast, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLTCOb0BMus">gingers have sex,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and another one says "when you drive too fast, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HWOwLT7S18">an emo is born."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kusjRALY8aM">The bushfire ads in Victoria.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Black smoke with audio of family desperately trying to save their home, then a blast, and then pictures of a destroyed house. Appear to be designed by some psychopath in the Victorian government for the purpose of deliberately traumatising bushfire victims. Don't blame the CFA for this, we had nothing to do with it. Two follow-ups included a couple driving through a bushfire-affected area and crashing their car, and a family leaving too late only to be trapped by the fire. Thankfully they were shorter and somewhat less terrifying than the original.
</li><li> The subway <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=IJNR2EpS0jw">safety video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DumbWaysToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DumbWaysToDie">Dumb Ways to Die</a>" by Melbourne Metro. Apparently, cute cartoon characters dying in grisly ways + a catchy song = <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWebHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWebHit">Instant Web Hit</a>.
</li><li> Australian level crossing safety ads are brutal (rightfully so).
<ul><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/UWITbOwXEYg">particularly cruel one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> depicts two lads in the country speeding on to a set of rails and getting themselves killed, and, much more upsettingly, a mother and her two children in the car. The mother gets her car stuck on the tracks behind a truck while the stop signal is showing, and the train comes speeding inexorably towards the car. The mother and her children start screaming and crying and then the train...turns them into white smoke, sparing us the gory aftermath. This is then followed by the slogan, "Don't play with trains."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/r6QI0RDGgww">Another version of this advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was produced for pedestrians at level crossings. It shows a woman on a bike observing the "correct" way to act on level crossing train tracks and two young boys observing the "wrong" way to behave on train tracks. The narrator sternly warns that trains are deceptively fast and can't stop easily, so to exercise care at all times near railways. Naturally, one of the boys goes after his basketball and gets "poofed" away by the train. The woman on the bike allows the train to pass safely, though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The ad then subverts our expectations by showing the woman forgetting that <em>two trains</em> pass through this level crossing...and she promptly gets killed by a train running the other way. Again, the slogan is: Don't play with trains.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly fine example of the form was the Victorian <a class="urllink" href="http://picturesofyou.com.au/">Pictures of You<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> campaign; aimed at stopping speeding. The original advertisement was played simultaneously across all commercial stations in Victoria, and is a heartbreaking piece of film. The extra content on the website, and the open letter that announced the simultaneous playing of the advertisement, are only slightly less devastating to watch.
</li><li> A PSA showed a man making a speech at his daughter's wedding with jokes about how he sexually abused her when she was a child; and everyone, including the bride and groom, laughing along. This was intended to challenge perceptions that victims of child abuse should somehow forget or "get over" the trauma as adults. Three radio PSAs followed the theme: one very similar to the TV ad, another with a woman and her mother reminiscing about how the mother neglected and emotionally abused her daughter, and one where an athlete makes an acceptance speech thanking his abusive father for making him learn to run fast.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IzFSjwxR7c">Here's the PSA in question.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

A voiceover says, "you wouldn't get away with it here, so why should you get away with it at home?"
</li><li> Another and rather disturbing anti-domestic abuse PSA had a shot of a child sitting on the stairs in black and white. In the background, he could hear his infuriated father yell at his wife about how he comes home from a long day at work and all she could do for dinner was order a pizza. She frantically tried to explain to him that she didn't know he was coming home early and therefore didn't have time to prepare, but he just interrupted her by yelling at her some more and then the child flinched when he heard the sound of a slap and his mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamDiscretionShot">crying</a>.

</li><li> The Coalition of Concerned Children's Advertisers have put out a number of classics over the years, including "North American House Hippo", "Hip Choice", and that Internet favourite, "Don't Put It in Your Mouth". Not to mention <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhgoXZDA7ig">this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> An ad from Quebec government against domestic violence shows a husband screaming and hitting her wife... from the wife's first person view. The actor was quite convincing, and the ad made the news for some time.
</li><li> A Radio PSA was made about young girls and their need for good role models. And to do that, the PSA was a "commercial" for an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EntertainmentTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EntertainmentTonight">Entertainment Tonight</a></em>-style tabloid where the major topics are about self destructive celebrities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a>.

We start out watching a baby shower in someone's house and at one point, the new mother opens up a package and finds out that a relative has given her new baby girl a whistle. She's confused for a second but when the woman who gave it to her explains that it's a rape whistle, things become fairly clear. As the mood chills, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">the announcer explains how dire life can still be for women</a> and we cut to the organization's logo and mission statement. (Though some have expressed concern over the unintentional implication that parents of sons needn't fear the possibility of abuse.)
</li><li> Canada has its share of anti-smoking, but none were as infectious as the 1987 spot featuring the domestic hit pop singer, Luba, who sings a positive message encouraging teens to "Break Free!" from the grip of tobacco to become a new generation of non-smokers.
</li><li> There was one PSA about food safety, comprising of nothing but watching sausages grill on a BBQ, while the song "When will I see you again?" plays in the background. The pay-off comes at the end of the PSA, when the screen fades to black and the words "A lot sooner than you think, if you don't cook it properly"
</li><li> On September 12, 2018, the Canadian animated show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen">6teen</a></em> created a PSA called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th_-odJs3ck&amp;t=372s">Vote, Dude<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It showed the main characters talking about the importance of voting.

Widely mocked and parodied on the internet.
</li><li> An advert for a fictional drink called "Trop" (Too Much) that began in the style of an alcopops commercial with happy, bronzed people frolicking on the beach and then degenerating into fighting, vomiting and sexually assaulting each other as they drink more and more.
</li><li> A series of PSAs with the tagline "Tu t'es vu quand t'as bu?" (roughly "Have you seen the state of yourself when you've been drinking?" depicted drunken people embarrassing themselves in various ways: e.g. a guy hooking up with a woman but then falling asleep on her, a man in a hospital waiting room yelling at other patients (and then missing his own appointment), and a student who drinks to steady his nerves before an exam but ends up going to the wrong room. A pre-fame Marion Cotillard appeared in one PSA as a girl at a party raving drunkenly at her crush (who eventually leaves in disgust.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Germany </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">

It has become kind of a cult classic, as it has the appearance of a completely average 70's TV production combined with an amount of over the top <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a> way outside what you usually see in German TV. It's also narrated by the narrator of a series of actual road safety PSAs.
</li><li> Internationally well-known is the series of five-minute spots originating in Germany unter the title <em>Der 7. Sinn</em>. It was used to educate in traffic safety - with the target audience being drivers. It ran from february 1966 through december 2005 and was broadcast among other countries in the US, Japan, Brazil and many more.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">     Hong Kong </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
Being a colony to the UK for a century, many of Hong Kong's PIFs are available in both Cantonese and English.
<ul><li> A PSA from Hong Kong showed a teenage girl being killed when an unspecified object falls out of a tower block window onto her head. The ad then goes on to demonstrate that anything falling from that height can be fatal, from a housewife accidentally knocking a pot plant off a balcony to a guy throwing beer bottles out of the window. Justified as HK is bristling with hi-rises.
</li><li> Two ads in a series about pollution:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du5huA64CP0">Pollution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> messes up a tree, making it dying. And then the picture turns upside down, and the tree turns into human lungs. Tagline: when nature is polluted, you can't escape from it too.
</li><li> A girl makes gestures while noises accompany her every move. The noises get louder and louder, until it mutes at her last gesture. Then we see tears on her face. Tagline: Noise pollution turns this world silent.
</li></ul></li><li> Illegal renovation on public housing was rampant in the 80s. One ad sees children ruining their toy block towers with such modifications, then it is shown the kids live in one such flat.
</li><li> This other one has a couple going home to make out. They reach the flat's illegally bolted-on balcony and as they're about to kiss, the balcony breaks, leaving the girl falling and hanging on for dear life.
</li><li> A series of ads for a charity in aid of teen mothers used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> to show the problems of teenage pregnancy, including a girl screaming at her pregnant boyfriend to have an abortion, and a boy having to beg his mother for money because he's going to have a baby.
</li><li> Hong Kong regularly airs fire prevention ads aimed at people living in densely packed apartment blocks. The ads are usually based around the safe use of fire doors, keeping exits clear so people can escape, and helping your neighbours in the event of a fire.
</li><li> Another one compares cavemen cooking with fire, and a modern restaurant which has its fire exit locked. A blaze breaks out in the latter and no one is safe.
</li><li> Hong Kong's Council on Smoking and Health has been known for making these ads:
<ul><li> There's one cigarette ad for a fictional brand <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/dQf-vzbPw-g">'Promised Land'<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (complete with health warning) from 1989, which turns out to be an anti-smoking PSA. A narrator 'welcomes' viewers to the Promised Land as a couple waves goodbye to a passing car from a hilltop place. They begin smoking the cigarettes. The man puts away the cigarette packaging while the narrator explains that cigarette smoking looks cool on the surface. As he says 'take another look', the sky turns dark and stormy (so is the cigarette pack, along with a skull-and-crossbones appearing) and the couple coughs non-stop. Then it is revealed they are at a cemetery, the guy puts the cigarette pack on a tombstone, and the couple walks slowly at the camera while funeral pyres burn in the background. The cig pack falls from the tombstone and is burned along with funeral money.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D58hnzzheL4">And then there's another from 1995<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which contrasts the narrator's sweet talk about the 'fame' you'll get from smoking against images of a hospital, xray, a toilet, and eventually a funeral, while Broadway-ish music plays. The female backing vocals singing "You will never be coming back" at the end helped spook everyone out.
</li><li> From the same year, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/DZGnfh7Ma7U">this ad compares life to a cinema billboard.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> 'Living' is aired on 'now showing'. The 'showing tomorrow' and 'next change' sections display logos of famous films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheLineOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheLineOfFire">In the Line of Fire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em> along with burning cigarettes, one stick for each film. The real shock comes at the 'coming soon' section where the final film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em>, is accompanied by three burning josssticks (incense sticks burnt for deities and passed ancestors).
</li></ul></li><li> One anti-drug ad was based on one of the songs (its lyrics containing references to DUI and drugs) from Sammi Cheng, a famous singer from HK. The ad features a modified version of the karaoke music video to the song, where a girl is singing to the song. Then the song fast-forwards to the final part, and the girl is heavily affected from drug abuse, causing her to sing badly. Before she finishes the last line, her head smashes the screen and the camera zooms out to reveal a TV in a landfill. A creepy voice exclaims 'do you still want to try (drugs)?' Tagline: 'Playing with drugs? You can't win.'
</li><li> Another PSA goes as follows, landfill compactor rolls through the pile of garbage. A single white bag of garbage is shown in the center, and as the camera zooms to the bag, we see the content: ruined toys and a broken doll. The meaning: people should not be selfish and greedy. The background ballad song did not help.
</li><li> The ICAC, aside from its effective anti-corruption ops, has a few of its own. Remember: whichever way you look at it, corruption doesn't pay.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ0w9QrxX54">A 1984 ad featuring a mock game of Monopoly.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The first player works hard to earn a house for his family, a school (education) and a hospital (healthcare). The second player pays a huge sum (representing bribes) and takes away player 1's properties. Player 1 then picks up a Community Chest card bearing the ICAC's number and logo, and player 2 is sent to jail. Originally the linked video was in Cantonese.
</li><li> From 1982, here's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ3PE4jsd6U">this ad.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Hong Kong's society is represented as an apple, being the fruit of hard labour of everyone; and the corrupt are represented as worms, eating the apple until it's rotten. The linked video was also originally in Cantonese.
</li><li> Here's this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYVfflqLlo">English PSA from 1994, entirely done in claymation.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Stuart, a successful businessman, turns into a crocodile (symbolic of his taking bribes) and is later put behind bars by his colleague who reported it, being unable to stand the damages Stuart does to his family and friends.
<div class="indent">Stuart's colleague: "Oh, everyone knew Stuart. I used to envy him. Good job, nice home, but that wasn't good enough; he wanted to get rich quick. He cheated, took bribes; he didn't care who he hurt, even his friends and family. I reported him to the ICAC; somebody had to. Nobody wants to do anything with him."
</div></li><li> From 1987. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFP1GI0rQPg">An executive of a top company ignores corruption amongst his employees, and his shiny gold plaque (which the boss takes great care of, even wiping it every so often) turns rusty and breaks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In a nod to the Godber case (the reason ICAC was set up, and one of the first cases they won), a British businessman/officer walks around his prison cell while voices of his accomplice and family echo.
</li><li> There's a 2014 anti-corruption video targeted at children, featuring Gee Dor Dor the rabbit. It involves a pig, a fox, and a squirrel, who have been sent on a mission by Gee Dor Dor to take 3 crystals:
<ul><li> Red crystal representing love
</li><li> Yellow crystal representing honesty
</li><li> Blue crystal representing fairness
</li></ul></li><li> They must retrieve them before time runs out and so will the energy levels of what the crystals stand for.

</li><li> The DOE (Department of the Environment) have produced a number of different campaigns, all horrific in their own rights. A majority of the campaigns ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>-the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> onwards have had what could be classed as unsuitable music playing in the background, but yet they manage to make them worse.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pATbxxkoikg">most infamous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> road safety ad from Ireland is probably one where a drinking driver rolls his car and somehow goes over a fence and into someone's garden, <em>landing</em> on a child who was playing there. Don't watch without clean underwear to hand. It caused a wrenching case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> the first time viewers saw it, as there's everything's pretty happy up to that point.

</li><li> A two part campaign called 'Pay attention or pay the price' about the dangers of being distracted while crossing the road and while driving. <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/DXMjaxtE6LI">The first one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows a teenage boy texting a teenage girl while crossing the road, resulting in him being run over and killed. <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/JeksWmadojY">The other<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows a mother picking her son up from school, and they start to walk home. As they are about to cross the road though, the point of view switches to a man driving and getting distracted by a woman across the street. He runs over the mother and son, killing the child. Both ads had the song 'I want to walk you home' playing in the background.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/_-FC40_WWSA">This anti speed campaign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> entitled 'Thoughts' has a young couple on a drive while a different music track (<em>I Can See Clearly Now</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Don't Stop Me Now</a></em>, <em>Call Him Mr Vain</em> by Culture Beat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">Highway to Hell</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Roxette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Roxette">It Must Have Been Love</a></em>) plays as the driver begins to increase in speed, and his girlfriend begins to get increasingly more nervous, even appearing to be shouting at him to slow down. They crash into the back of a car where a little girl is watching the line of traffic, throwing her out of the car and killing her instantly. The ad ends with the voice over of a court room while the driver's girlfriend looks at him with disgust, huddled in a blanket with a police officer comforting her.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/_-FC40_WWSA">Excuses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows the daily lives of victims in road accidents caused by speeding drivers, such as a paralyzed woman being lifted onto her hospital bed, a man looking at a photo of his dead wife, and a woman taking off her prosthetic leg. We hear voiceovers of the victims talking about the excuses the drivers that seriously hurt them gave ("I was in a hurry", "I thought the text was important", "The sun was in my eyes" etc.) The ad ends with a girl and her father driving while the girl says it was just an accident, and a lorry smashes into their car landing on top of theirs, presumably killing them.

It features a bunch of people sitting in a waiting room in the afterlife, with a stern-faced receptionist directing them to different doorways depending on how they died. Finally, only a cringing woman and a little girl are left in the waiting room, and the girl tearfully says that her mother didn't check the battery to the smoke alarm.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Japan </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> After the 2011 Touhoku earthquake and tsunami, advertisers did not want to be seen to be trying to profit from the tragedy, so TV stations ran endless PSAs from Ad Council Japan. Viewers complained that they hated the jingle played at the end of the commercials, and the Ad Council eventually muted it. Particular criticism was directed at the frequent repeat of an ad encouraging women to get breast cancer screenings, when several hospitals had been destroyed and many more were full up with victims of the disaster.
</li><li> There's a well known Japanese <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeXuZexUIc4">PSA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a class of schoolkids are drawing, but one boy just sits colouring pieces of paper black. He is taken to doctors and psychologists, but doesn't stop his work until finally the adults put the hundreds of sheets of paper together to create a large image of a whale. The message was to encourage parents to allow children to use the individual creativity they possess, rather than clamping down on it.
</li><li> In one frequently-aired PSA, a teenage boy feels guilty when he doesn't give up his seat for a pregnant woman on a train; in the next scene he is then shown taking the time to patiently help an elderly person up some stairs. Many Japanese PSAs are focused on the importance of good manners, helping each other and following rules, rather than issues like crime or safety.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMariosFireBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMariosFireBrigade">Super Mario's Fire Brigade</a></em> was an animated short made for usage in schools. In it, Mario and Luigi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> fame help teach two siblings about fire safety. There was also a sister PSA called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMarioTrafficSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMarioTrafficSafety">Super Mario Traffic Safety</a></em> about how to keep safe while by traffic.
</li><li> An anti-piracy campaign features a man with a video camera for a head recording in a rather empty cinema hall (there's only him and a startled female filmgoer). Suddenly an officer with a red police siren for a head shows up and Camerahead tries to run away. The campaign is even parodied in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> films.

One of them takes off his mask, and then several others follow suit, representing courage to overcome apathy.
</li><li> Three anti-drug ads, aimed at teenage girls:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsklXbvm8yI">A girl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is smiling while a phone messaging window is superimposed, with "I'm going to try it just once" written. As she takes drugs, her face turns more grim, her hair turns blonde and unkempt, while the messages are about her trying drugs just one more time, and then trying to stop, until the end where it's only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">Madness Mantra</a> of "HELPHELPHELPHELP".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do1HmyLpGKU">Another girl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> introduces her friends to drugs.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Malaysia </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
Malaysia's PIFs are sometimes more diverse than the Hong Kong examples above, being available in Malay (official language), Mandarin, Tamil and English.
<ul><li> Drugs is a scourge, and these campaigns tell you why:
<ul><li> Perhaps taking a page from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MethProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MethProject">Meth Project</a> (although this time it's not focusing on a particular narcotic), there's an ad where an addict shoplifts a convenience store. As he proceeds with his drug-induced spree, another guy who somehow looks like him enters and robs the counter. He sees the first addict and tackles him down, furiously screaming "If you had never taken drugs, your life won't become this ruined!" Turns out there was no stick-up addict, the shoplifting addict is hallucinating and shivering on the floor.
</li><li> Another addict also gets into a hallucination, where he sees people hurling insults at his mother and daughter because their son/father is an addict.
</li><li> The third ad marches straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> territory. An addict sees his mother performing prayers in her bedroom, then proceeds to raid her drawer for jewelry while she's not watching. She sees the act, and tries to stop him, but he pushes her away too hard and her head hits the bedside. The addict ends up slumping at the bedroom door, crying, because he just killed his mother.
</li></ul></li><li> An anti-drink-driving campaign in the 1990s features three ads; the ads rather infamously copied Australia's TAC ads Girlfriend, Beach Road (which was about speeding) and Joey.
</li><li> "You Can Make a Difference", from the late 90s till the late 2000s, is the largest road safety campaign in the country:
<ul><li> An ad targeted at jaywalkers gives the viewers an acid trip where all the cars and lorries turn into wild animals.
</li><li> Some kids are walking along the road after football practice, in the same direction as the traffic (Malaysians drive on the left). Passing cars are honking at them, but the noises fall on deaf ears. It takaes a lorry mowing one of them down that the lads realise what happened.
</li><li> A schoolgirl enters the classroom late, her face is bruised up and her father accompanies her. Turns out her face hit the dashboard when her father suddenly braked - because she wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
</li><li> A boy who plays football for his school is incapacitated because a driver didn't notice him while the boy was crossing the road.
</li><li> There's an ad where school desks, chalkboards, computers etc are run over by a car, symbolizing kids who die/get injured by road accidents.
</li></ul></li><li> One ad about septic tank safety sees a boy falling into the tank just because he wants to pick up a ball.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAsX3iHm93M">One railway safety ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for national railway company KTM, made in the 1990s, is pure undistilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>. A schoolgirl and her grandfather get hit by a train while crossing the railway. The aftermath shows the girl's shoe and gramp's bicycle wheel, both stained with blood. The crash was filmed using mannequins but was realistic enough to scare people up.
</li><li> A 70s/80s road safety ad has body bags replacing cars and trucks on the city streets.
</li><li> Another from the late 80s, about speeding, either attracted people to arcade racing game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun">OutRun</a></em> or straight-up scared them into avoiding it. The ad involves a man playing the game, racking up points as he goes faster. As the score goes into the nine-hundred, the player suddenly loses control and the screen suddenly changes into the underside of a lorry, with glass shards scattered around.
</li><li> One animated ad sees mosquitoes having a party in a house before insecticides and dragonflies bust them out.
</li><li> Another has an animated public toilet forcing a man to flush after leaving.
</li><li> One particular awkward one about vandalism. A mother gets some strange sickness. Her daughter calls for ambulance; but the driver can't find his way due to road signs being covered by posters and flyers. Paramedics arrive late to a dead woman in a pool of blood and the girl crying. (By all means possible, no sickness causes massive bleeding all over the body, like what the woman had.)
</li><li> Another weird PSA about corruption. A woman accepts a bribe from some shady figure. She opens the bag of money to realize the cash was actually funeral money (the ones that the Chinese burn for dead people) and she gets teleported to somewhere in a forest. She gets some hysterical vision and begins to scream. Then the whole thing flashbacks to before she takes the money; this time she rejects. Then the narmiest message ever appears: "Corruption brings you to another world." Yes. They just said that corruption KILLS.
</li><li> Several 90s AIDS ads:
<ul><li> A bride running towards her groom while a voice pauses her over and over about the possibility the man has HIV, and the importance of doing HIV checks.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpRhO4V6Q_Q">Scenes of people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ostracizing HIV positive people: A father disowning his son, a boss firing his employer, and a woman screaming "GET OUT! GET OUT!". The twist is the last one being a woman with HIV comforted by her family.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoVjmpN1Ah0">A father returns from abroad,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> welcomed by his wife and daughter. Then it cuts to a flashback where a prostitute rudely knocks on his hotel room door. He opens, and the lady offers her service. He rejects and slams the door on her. Back to the airport, the man snaps out of his flashback and gifts a teddy bear for his daughter and a bar of chocolate for his wife.
</li></ul></li><li> Motorcycle accidents are a serious issue on Malaysian roads until today, with law enforcement working to lessen casualties on the road and curb any and all speeding bikers alike. Here's why:
<ul><li> In the late 90s and early 00s, there is one PSA that kept transitioning between present day (at the hospital, where the victim are brought to the surgeon's room) and past moments (on the scene of accident, with paramedics and coroners detailing the scene). Within the duration, we get to see the fate of the victim's grieving family with a group of surgeon failed to save the patient's life before the person responsible looks above, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33w4haSm21A">only to find an officer about to charge the man for his negligience.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04zIkDlaXL8">This ad retells the victim's stories from the family's point of view.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> If you're riding a bike while exceeding more than 80 km/h (equating about 50 mph), it's as if you're <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM5DpDvOsdo">falling down from a building of five storeys height.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> One in the 90s involves home safety, involving dangerous objects seen through a baby's point of view and carries the message of why babies should not be left alone in the house. It starts with the baby seeing a kettle full of boiling water as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>, its father's medicines as Smarties, metal cutlery as their rounded plastic counterparts to name a few. Then the baby goes to the bathroom and sees a large basin full of water. The baby then crawls out the window and suddenly the camera zooms out of the house accompanied with a disturbing crying voice. Is it mentioned that the house is built on a cliff?
</li><li> Speaking of cliffs, the 2017 campaign for slope safety. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxmzoqNk3Ko">Here's the video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Food variety is one of Malaysia's attractions, but food waste is also a problem in the country. What better way to send the message "don't waste food" than <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWgbXiZ8dEY">this ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which walks a fine line between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">Food Porn</a> and tragedy?

Some of these ended with car accidents, but others had the drunkards suffer from other consequences, such as the entering the house only to find out their wife took the kids and left them.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">     The Netherlands </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A few years ago, there was a series of anti-smoking ads on Dutch TV, showing teens doing all sorts of anti-social things, justifying them with the line "Hey, at least I don't smoke!". The idea was to show people that smoking was worse, except the teens did things like kicking people working under their cars in the groin, causing the car to collapse on them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Most people agreed that they'd prefer to see the teens smoking.</a>
</li><li> There's a new "protect your privacy online" ad making the rounds in the Netherlands. While this sounds like a sensible idea, there are some problems with how it's presented. The tips they give you on the website of the campaign make it sound like you should better not voice your opinion ever on the internet and there are plans for some government controlled databases that hold a lot more private information than you would ever put online.
</li><li> One Child Safety ad gives the message that whenever a baby or toddler needs help, its cry will alert you. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dutyVtUHwg">Unless it's drowning.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Though to be honest, most of the adults watching it should probably be able to tell the difference between lemonade and paint thinner. Especially when there's a paintbrush sitting in it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ngbwGkq-b8">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ad continues the theme by showing a compilation of home-video clips of babies and young children being involved in small accidents, complete with laugh track and wacky sound effects a la <em>America's Funniest Home Videos</em>. And then several more clips are played, only this time the audience can hear the children start crying in pain/fear immediately after, cutting to black screens of text each time which give the message that '...thousands of parents watch their children break bones, suffer brain damage, even die as a result of falling accidents. 80% of all accidents happen under adult supervision. Learn faster than they do.'. The message being essentially that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">adult are useless in regards to preventing young children from hurting themselves</a>.
</li><li> A fire safety campaign challenged people to be blindfolded and attempt to find their way out of the house in 2 minutes, to simulate trying to escape during a fire. Invariably they wouldn't make it or in one ad a woman did get out in time but was reminded that she had forgotten her kids.
</li><li> A PSA using the soundtrack of Eric Clapton's <em>Tears in Heaven</em> (written about the loss of his son, who died falling out of the window of a high-rise) focused on the dangers to children and the elderly of falling over.
</li><li> A rather sweet ad about child safety showed a couple who are careful to protect their toddler from dangers and not let him fall over or injure himself. He is then shown as an adult many years later, returning the favour by checking his now-elderly parents' home for dangers and giving them a rubber safety mat to use in the bathroom.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">     New Zealand </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the 1980s, a domestic tourism campaign featured a New Zealander travelling around the world with the foreigners knowing more about the tourist attractions in New Zealand than he did. Cue while he is kayaking on the Zambezi River, someone asks him where the Victoria Falls are: he replies "somewhere near Taupo,"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qi7f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qi7f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qi7f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That's the Huka Falls.</span> not realising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">they were dead ahead of him</a>. The lesson - "Don't leave town until you've seen the country."
</li><li> The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) and its predecessors have a whole treasure trove of iconic PSAs:
<ul><li> A recent New Zealand Road safety campaign has put up billboards on major highways that cry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfBlood">Tears of Blood</a> when it rains.
</li><li> There's an infamous ad from New Zealand in which a man is paralyzed in a road accident because he was driving too fast, and then his wife receives a speed camera fine that was issued to him earlier on the day of his accident. The phrase "IT'S THE SAME DAY, DAVID!" is a widely known meme in NZ pop culture.
</li><li> An anti-drink driving ad aimed at the Maori community showed a boy at a party trying to decide whether to say something to a drunk friend who is planning to drive. He debates the possible consequences in a humorous monologue, including being haunted by the ghost of his friend who offers him chips, and finally finds the courage to speak up in front of everybody. The ad was so successful it inspired the song "Ghost Chips" by The Cuzzies, and immortalized the phrase "you know I can't grab your ghost chips!"
</li><li> A series of anti-drinking ads:
<ul><li> A man gets drunk at a family barbecue and picks up his nephew and spins him around, but crashes into a wall and seriously injures the child. The man is chased out of the house and collapses in an alleyway sobbing.
</li><li> People getting drunk and suffering the consequences (injuries, emotional fits, inability to remember the night before) while the sober version of themself watches and cringes in horror.
</li><li> An office worker goes out to the pub after work and starts drinking to soothe her nerves, getting steadily drunker. She is eventually abducted/presumably raped by a man who follows her. This ad led to complaints of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">victim-blaming</a> in the premise.
</li><li> A drunk dad at a wedding tries to break-dance, injures his back and is publicly berated by his humiliated kids.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There was this ad about the dangers of speeding, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2MGCV-92e4">Here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where time pauses and the two drivers get out of their vehicles to talk. It doesn't stop time from resuming and the crash happening. Other people make mistakes, drive carefully so you can react to them is the message.
</li><li> A man drives drunk, crashes his SUV, and flips the car. He is stuck upside down in the car, with the windows partially open, but is too badly injured to escape and torrential rains begin, causing him to eventually drown.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Philippines </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, the Department of Health or DOH churned up a jingle about iodized salt called "Mag-Iodized Salt Tayo", and distributed free iodized salts with the then-president's first name. The jingle became a hit for Filipino schoolchildren and even parodied on occasion, and it was the brainchild of the then-Secretary, who finished it by saying "Let's DOH it!" Needless to say, that Secretary was very popular at the time.
</li><li> Another PSA involves the anti-cholera campaign called T.K.O, the abbreviation spelling out "water, toilet, oral rehydration salts." It also has a catchy jingle. Like the above, it ends with the "Let's DOH it!" phrase.
</li><li> An anti-garbage ad about a pig eating through a bedlam with the message "Don't be a pig. You are not a pig" was widely parodied by schoolchildren.
</li><li> The Health Department also ran AIDS awareness ads like this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG6zMTYQ0yk">video compilation,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for example, comparing AIDS victims to a broken ladder step, or a rusting pipe.
</li><li> A breastfeeding advocacy ad has the following: "Dog's milk is for puppies. Pig's milk is for piglets. Cow's milk, for my baby? My baby is not an animal."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipYsZzEfuY">An infamous ad and music video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about reproductive health and teen pregnancy named "Gaga Girl, Bobo Boy" was pulled because of complaints it perpetuated sexist stereotypes. By the way, the words 'gaga and bobo' meant whore and idiot in Filipino, so this was for many very offensive.
</li><li> Later another ad showed up named "Inakup, Arekup", which uses children in a situation where they are poor because they have a large family, implying that the quality of life would improve with a small family. The second ad was better received.
</li><li> Posters in public that depicts <strong>real and uncensored</strong> injuries to discourage the use of fireworks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">Nausea Fuel</a>.
</li><li> A more lighthearted example of an ad released by Health Department was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MitchGlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MitchGlee">Mitch Glee</a> which featured actress Mitch Valdez having a musical about the government's TB-DOTS treatment program for tuberculosis.
</li><li> Incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte's "Anti-Drug Campaign" has been shown in media.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">     Russian Federation </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In 2010, someone in the Russian Ministry of Health remembered that a common Russian slang phrase for delerium tremens meant something along the lines of "the squirrel from Hell." The result of this was a series of anti-drinking advertisements featuring a drunken, bedraggled CGI squirrel with bloodshot eyes who acted like a man gone half-insane after a night getting plastered. The tagline had him look right at the camera and say "Getting drunk? I'll be coming your way!!"
<ul><li> For those who don't see the connection - in Russian language the word Squirrel (<em>Be-lo-ch-ka</em>) used to describe <strong>Delirium tremens</strong> (shaking frenzy) (<em>Be-la-ya Go-rya-ch-ka</em>) that is caused by excessive drinking. It's faster to say (than the full phrase) and rather well known to the public. Delirium causes hallucinations, so a visit from a squirrel is a sure sign that you need a doctor right now.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Singapore </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
As with Malaysia, Singapore's public ad campaigns are often found in the same four languages, with English being the main language.
<ul><li> The Partnership for a Drug-Free Singapore, while shorter-lived than its American cousin, does pump out terrifyingly effective ads:
<ul><li> If you take ecstasy, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eT2j8iMKSk">you're signing up to be the test subject of unscrupulous narcotics labs.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Apparently, if you're having a heroin withdrawal, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSykqXny0ho">you can't poop properly because your butt will be so irritated wiping it will cause burning sensations,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx5Ydm8tEMo">your crap and piss are sweated out instead.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Gross-out warning.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj-KhKEzicI">Scenes of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0uUqmofuRo&amp;itct">children<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIlf11Il10U">having fun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> compared to their heroin-addled grown-up selves. Pretty heartbreaking to parents who lost their children to drugs.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNFfgqXXGfQ">Speaking of parents,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> nobody wants to see his/her child get into drugs, what more imprisoned for it.
</li><li> The Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association is an obscure successor to the PDFS. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKM-NVKEHDg">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is their only offering: an artistic writing performance with the words matching the narrative. Language warning.
</li></ul></li><li> There's enough fraudsters with top acting skills nowadays to give them <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii8c_XLnqSc">"Black Heart" awards.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This campaign warns us of the various types of frauds, from pretending to be a police officer, to seducing people into giving money. The 2018 campaign even ran a social media voting contest to see <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VztwMVHUSaE">which type of fraudster is the most unpopular.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Two rather hilarious anti-drink-driving campaigns:
<ul><li> A guy is going out for a drink, but he can't find his car keys. After searching through his house, he later takes the cab instead. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XorV34QMxo">Turns out his pet dog hid the keys<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpFT9olAHMs">A bunch of drinkers are cleaning their breath to avoid the breathalyser test:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> drinking water, coffee and tea; brushing their teeth; and even doing exercise at the carpark.
</li></ul></li><li> Singapore's gambling problem is alarming: people who lose their bet often turn to loan sharks, and the government is forced to limit its citizens' entry to the country's only two casinos (although lotteries are not restricted, and are still held almost every day).
<ul><li> "Excuses" sees a man trying to borrow money from someone so that he can gamble. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">He promises to return the money once he's hit jackpot, and that this is his last bet</a>. The camera cuts to the other side to reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">he's begging money from his daughter, who's clutching a piggy bank in her hands</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mp4YiCdWDQ">This campaign aimed at youths<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> asking them to influence their friends out of gambling obsession sees a guy seeing his friend engrossed in football betting. He wonders what happens if he doesn't do anything about it: the friend gets expelled from university and booted out of the house by his mother. He lodges at the guy's place and borrows money from him. Soon borrowing turns to stealing until the SWAT team comes knocking. The guy then snaps out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> and stops his friend from betting further.
</li><li> Perhaps the most infamous (and funniest) campaign is 2014's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRValgHDvxE">"Kick the Habit,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in conjunction with the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. A group of kids are discussing which team will win the World Cup. Andy, one of the kids, wishes Germany win, because his father bet all his life savings on them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Germany won the 2014 World Cup</a>. Though it became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> in 2018 when Germany lost in the group stages.
<ul><li> After Germany won, <a class="urllink" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/792/988/7fc.jpg">the website was updated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to show a conversation between Andy and another kid. The kid asks Andy if he got his savings back, and Andy says that he didn't, because his dad wanted to keep on betting.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Sweden </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In an amusing spoof of these, the Swedish bus company <em>Väst Trafik</em> features several of these being made fun of to fit with the message "take the bus" ("Sleep behind the wheel. Way behind the wheel", for example).
</li><li> Swedish ads for paying your TV licence fees are... bizarre, to put it mildly. "Do you want a snail in your eye?" anyone? The newest one is more like "If you pay your licence fees the TV-people will stalk you and perform musical numbers."

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRUBMBi_lp4">The Green Cross Code ads<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the 1970s; starring Dave "Darth Vader" Prowse.
</li><li> The "Don't die before you've lived" road safety ads aimed at teenagers. One purported to be a trailer for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries">The Bourne Identity</a></em>-style movie and ended with the star being hit by a car as a teenager. There were also posters for this, which seems to have focused on the London area.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg6IVUvVsAs">Lonely Waters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is a patently terrifying British advert. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a> voices The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water, who watches children drown (offscreen, fortunately) as they play unattended by the river. Sensible children can defeat him, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEchoes">he'll be back</a></em>...

It apparently stimulates an area of the brain called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">Shatner's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">bassoon</a>."
</li><li> The United Kingdom has a number of government information adverts that sound more like... well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">threats</a>. Specifically, those involving paying your car tax, only claiming the benefit money due to you and making sure your TV license payments are up to date.
<ul><li> They couldn't get worse than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainScarletAndTheMysterons">Mysteron</a>-style rings of light hunting down benefit cheats.
</li><li> The TV licence adverts were parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a></em>, which had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">the BBC</a> staging the deaths of people who failed to pay the licence fee — the original slogan was "Get a TV licence — it's cheaper than a fine"; the sketches changed this to "a funeral".
</li><li> The TV licensing department later followed this up with the aggressive and bullying slogan, "pay now or you'll pay later". It sounds like a protection racket...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/pifs/pifs_g-l.html">Health Education Board Scotland,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the tagline "Think About It", as well as the Scottish Executive and a few other outliers like the NHS and charities, are responsible for giving us these Scottish public information films:
<ul><li> Cute girl, aged about 15, walking down school corridor, sees guy. They walk toward each other in slow motion with romantic music. He says to his friend, "[You] should've seen the state of her on Friday night!" Cut to her puking in a toilet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Imaginary narration</a>: <em>So ye see ladies, ye'll never get a husband if ye behave like a slattern.</em>
</li><li> A girl running around on a beach surrounded by a pastel-coloured <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4l0UJt9D8s">aura,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the typically vague tradition of Partnership for a Drug-Free America - "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a>, but don't expect this advert to explain why".
</li><li> Another anti-drug one did a split screen about how different a teenage boy's life is if he becomes a heroin addict, compared to saying no. The two stories converge as he passes by himself as a beggar on the street. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayqlFkbtzM4">Any spare change, pal?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> An anti-smoking ad which depicted a cartoon land where there was intense pressure to chew blue sticks with various unpleasant side effects. The punchline "That tastes <em>boggin'!</em>" was a playground catchphrase for a while (imagine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">a Glasgow accent</a>). <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f22wSJ8mslQ">The monotone narrator actually makes it ''funnier'', oddly enough.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhhprl87EAU">Another ad directed at secondhand smoke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that would make Indiana Jones run screaming. Complete with a baby getting attacked by creepy phantom reptile.
</li><li> A much more sombre anti-smoking advert that showed a (presumably dying) woman pleading with her young son never to smoke.
</li><li> A giant strawberry that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">turned out to be full of snakes</a>, to show that if you take acid, you never know if your trip will turn bad.
</li><li> Another campaign that started out as happy, funny scenes that ended with people randomly and violently and as realistically as possible run over by cars.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> campaign <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82c22jbLVcE">"Messages,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a woman is getting ready for a night out and is confronted with various nasty comments on labels, washing powder boxes, etc. with a male voiceover.
</li><li> A parody of music videos with three Britney-esque girls singing about how the smell of their cigarette smoke scares all their boyfriends away. The ad became so popular that it led to an official chart release of the song.
</li><li> A father ranting and raving at his teenage daughter after she's been arrested for drug possession.
</li><li> A montage of smiling children, with the voiceover saying that these are the results of a healthy diet in addition to regular brushing. Kind of unusual in that you expect a jump scare with some poor kid with rotten nashers at end, but it doesn't happen.
</li><li> One from Rape Crisis Scotland, providing the sadly still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">necessary</a> message that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmgbT10_2pI">no one asks to be raped.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> One <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2DsrwXuCfY">advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> encouraging people to seek treatment for cancer has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> effect going on with the voice-over talking about how horrible it can to think you might have cancer, while a woman walks into a doctor's surgery, presumably for a critical appointment. When she goes into the office, she sits down in her chair and reassures viewers that cancer is much more treatable than it was in the past and that you should go to your doctor rather than get so scared that you don't do anything about it.
</li><li> A man rushes into water to help someone who is drowning, but discovers when he pulls them out that the drowning man is himself. The voiceover talks about how people don't help themselves by trying to reduce their risk of cancer, strokes and heart disease.
</li><li> Foreigners enthusiastically talking about how wonderful and welcoming Scotland is, juxtaposed with images of white Scottish people being racist in some way.
</li><li> An ad encouraging people to be better parents, with a father lounging apathetically on a sofa and ignoring his young son who is begging him to come and play football.
</li><li> An anti-drinking ad where a boy tries and fails several times to work up the courage to ask out the girl he likes. Eventually they're at a house party together and he drinks to soothe his nerves, but ends up leering and slobbering all over her and the girl pushes him away in disgust.
</li><li> Teenagers taking cocaine in a club and being confronted by a Grim Reaper-esque figure who forces them to draw from a deck of cards. This induces different effects in each one: a guy sweating heavily and a girl collapsing with chest pains while her friend (who drew "Paranoia") runs away rather than helping her. Finally, only one card is left: "Stroke", causing the last cocaine user of the night to drop dead in his girlfriend's arms.
</li><li> A girl's friends are encouraging her to try heroin, but she isn't sure she wants to. They convince her to go over to their dealer's apartment, but then police raid the place and everyone's arrested.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQHd96-jHdU">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> anti-drinking PSA from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHealthService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHealthService">National Health Service</a> seemed to be setting up a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>-esque movie, then twisted it around to show a drunken idiot falling to his death after climbing up scaffolding to retrieve a helium balloon. Another one, showing a fun scene of friends at lunch in a pub, ended by revealing that it was all an hallucination by a drunken bum accosting a woman at a bus stop.
</li><li> One spawned in the wake of the MMR debacle featured a baby sitting on cliff surrounded by tigers, saying that parents were putting their kids in unnecessary danger by denying them the vaccine.
</li><li> The very scary "Drinking and Driving Wrecks Lives" campaign by Safety on the Move from the 80s and 90s showed the consequences of drinking and driving from multiple perspectives, from the driver to the victim to family, friends, and others caught up in the tragedy. The ads were usually shown around the holiday season (with one notable exception) and include the following:
<ul><li> The jolly seasonal <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjDbtdrxMdE">"Christmas Pudding"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> features a family getting ready to enjoy said pudding when one of them recieves a phone call informing her that her boyfriend (who told her earlier he was "stopping for a quick drink") has been in an accident. The merrily blazing pudding briefly morphs into a car in flames, and the laughter of her family in the background turns sinister.
</li><li> "In the Summertime", <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ma_Xv7rGM">one of the most famous UK ads from the 1990s,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed a few friends going for a drive on a summer afternoon (after leaving a pub) while Mungo Jerry's "In the Summertime" plays. Suddenly the music stops, and we cut to the car having hit a tree, the occupants bloody and presumably dead. It was meant to dispel the idea that alcohol-fueled accidents were mostly a problem during the holidays. The song was used because it has the unfortunate lyrics "Have a drink, have a drive". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">Hugo Speer, who played the drunk driver, later got into a drunk driving accident years later</a> (although he fared better in real life than he did in the commercial).
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du2P6HqkhqY">"Mirror,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> we zoom in slowly on a young woman putting on makeup in front of a vanity mirror while she talks about an accident she and her boyfriend got into. She knew he'd been drinking when she rode with him, but thought they were safe because "he'd only had a couple." She happily informs us they're still together, "though sometimes I think he's only with me because he feels guilty." As she looks towards the camera, we see she's using the makeup to cover scars from the accident, and she suggests that she only stays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">"because I'm scared I won't get anyone else."</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUC57ffRAM8">"Eyes"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> pulls out from the face of a young woman who has been run over by a drinking driver, as paramedics attempt to revive her and finally pronounce her dead, while the driver wails hysterically in the background.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/kADUAXf7hOo">"One more Dave"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows a woman preparing liquid food in a kitchen with voice over of men in a pub encouraging their friend Dave to have just one more drink, which he refuses, saying he's driving, but they continue to urge him. The woman is then seen serving up the liquid food to her quadriplegic son, and when he struggles she encourages him to have just one more spoonful.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/njTlLNb0nCA">Kathy can't sleep<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a harrowing ad showing a five or six year old girl wide awake in the middle of the night crying, while in the background her mother is heard shouting and crying hysterically at her father who killed a little boy due to driving under the influence. It was directed by Tony Kaye, who would later go on to direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanHistoryX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanHistoryX">American History X</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Think!</em> adverts' gruesome shock endings are so well known that it is something of a twist ending that the protagonist of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-xK_t-A_8E">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> fun, upbeat motorbike safety ad gets home safely.
</li><li> On the other hand, there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18km8VA-U5U">these<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> rather adorable adverts about crossing the street, all under the name of the "Think!" campaign.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zakUHLKA8Hk">A more recent UK campaign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to get people to drive more slowly through residential areas involves the horrifying image of a dead little girl against a tree, who is slowly dragged backward into the street, bones snapping back into place, before being shown in reverse being hit by a car. She then says that if hit at 30mph rather than 40mph, she has an 80% chance of survival.
<div class="indent"><strong>Russell Howard on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek">Mock the Week</a></em></strong>: "If you hit me at 40mph, there's an 80% chance I'll die. If you hit me at 30, there's an 80% chance I'll live." *twists head 90 degrees clockwise* "Stop trying to hit me..."
</div></li><li> An equivalent ad from the early 90s (part of the "Kill Your Speed, Not a Child" Campaign) showed three successive scenarios in which the children were hit by a speed sign in place of a car. Each scenario opened with the parents alluding to the fate of the child, with the consequences getting increasingly nastier as the speed goes up (broken leg, potential brain damage, death). No gore to speak of, but the final shots of the unfortunate third child's sister screaming to her and her toy pushchair being thrown up in the air were rather chilling.
</li><li> Also part of the "Kill your speed" campaign was a black and white ad featuring a young girl informing the audience that she will be killed and giving examples of various excuses that speeding drivers use after they have caused an accident such as running late for work or not paying attention. The TV and radio campaign used the music of Julee Cruise, whose creepy and haunting vocal style fit the visuals perfectly.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappierHomeMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappierHomeMovie">home video</a> "Kill your speed" campaigns showed video footage of young children in happier times: one had voice over of a police officer explaining the protocol for informing someone about a road accident, while others featured readings of poetry about death and mourning (including "Funeral Blues" by WH Auden and "Remember" by Christina Rossetti.) The adverts both end with the caption that all the children shown were killed by speeding drivers.
</li><li> Yet another anti-speeding ad featured the grim reaper, as played by a foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, gravel-voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">northerner</a> in a leather jacket, who narrates various events dealing with a young soldier called Chris. Chris returns home, having survived Iraq, only to be killed in a car crash not long later. Choice quote from the reaper himself: "If you're of a nervous disposition, I suggest ya fuck off and do summat else for a bit."
</li><li> There were a number of UK adverts offering advice on how to avoid being a target of theft, including not leaving anything valuable in your car, making sure you'd locked up the house properly and being discreet about using your mobile phone.
</li><li> One UK campaign against "binge drinking" showed a young man preparing to go for a night out. He urinates over his shoes, covers his shirt in curry, smashes his face into a door and rips out his own earring, before leaving the house looking as if he's gone several rounds with Mike Tyson. Another ad, aimed at young women merely showed the heroine vomiting into her hair and ripping her clothes. The clear implication was that women don't get into fights. Have they never encountered the rage of a drunken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">ladette</a> at 2 a.m.? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> has shown that these ads backfired: Little did these guys know, that telling your friends how you peed in your shoes and smashed your face against the door is funny as hell...
</li><li> There were 2 PIFs about AIDS several years ago. One featured icebergs falling apart while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt">a rather creepy sounding narrator</a> talks the effects that the disease has on a person. The ad ended with an iceberg shaped like the word AIDS. A considerably creepier one had the same narrator, but this time he talked over a man creating a tombstone with the word AIDS written on it. At the end, the tombstone falls, and then a leaflet about AIDS is dropped on it, and finally, some flowers. A couple years later, these ads were pulled from the air after complaints that they scared children.
</li><li> A Public Service Announcement from the early 1990s in England warned about getting early immunisation for childhood diseases. A group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">girls</a> dancing in a circle, holding hands. The shot is out of focus with a washed out look and skewed diagonally. The girls sing a disembodied echoing lullaby with no words as the names of the various diseases appear onscreen. The advert has overtones of "We are all dead from these diseases, and your kids will be, too."
</li><li> Britain has had some notoriously disturbing <em><a class="urllink" href="http://firekills.direct.gov.uk/video.html">Fire Kills<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> campaigns. One featured an elderly woman battering down her door as the smoke builds up behind her, as well as two young children involved in another fire calling for their mum and dad. This one was pulled off the air for being too distressing. It never stopped them from making plenty of other ads that were much creepier than that one.
</li><li> The British Government have recently started showing one where a guy crashes his car. As a voice-over details the impact (<em>"The crash didn't kill him. Because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, his rib splintered and punctured his lung and his arteries were ripped out of his heart"</em>) a close up on his torso shows the organs literally smacking against his skin and tearing apart, complete with grisly sound effects. Ghastly. A family-friendly version shown before the 9 p.m. "watershed" just shows him crumple against the wheel in slo-mo as the voiceover talks.
</li><li> If you want nightmares, look no further than <em><a class="urllink" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx67rr8B7dk">Robbie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apaches">Apaches</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://blip.tv/file/3942042/">(which you can watch here),<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> British PIFs on railway and farm safety respectively, which, in their uncut forms, are like mini-movies of pain and suffering.
<ul><li> As if that wasn't bad enough, <em>Robbie</em> was intended to be a milder replacement for an earlier film, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/bt/guruandwez/fycw/28509-the-finishing-line">The Finishing Line<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. How the entire generation that saw those films managed to <em>not</em> become traumatised is beyond understanding. <em>The Finishing Line</em> lasted two years, was televised in full on several occasions, and was 'withdrawn' rather than banned. The first five minutes can be enjoyed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/creativearchive/titles/7239.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1077210/index.html">BFI<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has released the full version on a compilation DVD so that everyone can appreciate the nightmare.
</li><li> <em>Robbie</em> itself was later replaced by a more modern (1990s) film called <em>Killing Time</em>. This film begins with a dramatisation of a group of friends walking home along a railway line and debating whether to cut across it to save time. One of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anviliciously</a> tells them how dangerous it is and leaves; but the others all run across the track, except for one boy who is too scared. Eventually, he does decide to walk across the track and join his friends but then, for reasons that are never explained (except to show the effects of being hit by a train) he just lies down in the middle of the tracks and is run over by an oncoming train. This is followed by real pictures from accident scenes and railway workers talking about the horror of people getting hit by trains.
</li><li> Apaches, however, lends itself to jokes a la <em>This is Your Brain on Drugs</em>, albeit sicker, as one of the kids dies by falling into a slurry pit.
</li><li> There was an urban version of <em>Apaches</em> filmed as well, this time warning kids of the dangers of building sites.
</li><li> The urban version of <em>Apaches</em> is called <em>Building Sites Bite</em> and features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Ronald</a> who is sent by his cousins to different building sites and is given the challenge to "Find his dog and get out without getting hurt." Needless to say, the poor lad stumbles upon his death in every site, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">buried alive in a trench collapse</a>, electrocuted by a frayed wire in a half-demolished house, breaking his skull on a concrete wall after falling off a pipe, crushed beneath a pile of bricks and drowns in an abandoned quarry. The moral of the story was that he simply should have declined to go or at least heeded all warning signs. The creepy part? When Ronald is electrocuted, they zoom in in his burned hand, then his pale body, dead on the floor of the building, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen">eyes wide open.</a> That, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">cousins are unfazed by his deaths.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end, it turns out that these deaths are all imagined by Ronald (hence his cousins not being fazed) and he ultimately decides to not go into the building sites.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> How about the stupidly traumatizing 'I'm Sorry I Killed You' UK advert? A boy in a car accident apologizing to his girlfriend for running her over. A group of 18-year-olds were left staring mutely at the sadist cop who showed it to us. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/148683">The judge must have seen that ad and gotten ideas.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A very beloved British PSA in the 1960s featured "Reginald Molehusband," a man who was hopelessly bad at parking his car. Buses changed their routes to avoid him and people took bets on his performance, until the day he did it right (with a demonstration for the viewer). In 2007 the BBC launched a nationwide appeal for any existing copies of the film but none were found, so they remade it with the original actor.
</li><li> There was one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> joking along with a dead boy racer and his mates. For some strange reason, it was only shown in cinemas in Scotland, despite being out with of HEBS.
</li><li> A misguided, but not creepy example is the UK government's adverts for their car scrappage scheme, where you trade in your old car for a more eco-friendly one (or less eco-damaging to be more exact), and get a discount from the government. The message starts, after some examples of 90's culture, "Wouldn't it be great if we could get rid of everything over 10 years old?" Well, not when they're being played on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing">a classic rock station</a>. In fact, think about it too much and it becomes decidedly sinister. Who made that ad?

</li><li> The UK is now running a TV campaign against driving under the influence of drugs, in which police pull over a group of stoned partygoers with hugely magnified eyes (to represent the fact that drug use produces involuntary effects on the eyes.)

She begins to be followed by a white transit van, with the voiceover narration "Like most victims, Julie knew her killer.", causing Julie (as does the viewer) to become unnerved as the van gets steadily closer. However, it soon indicates and moves down a side road, to Julie's relief...and that's when the voiceover states "It was her son..." and her car <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">unexpectedly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">crashes head-first into a parked car</a>, and the non seatbelt-wearing son in the backseat flies forward and crushes Julie in her seat, allowing blood to shoot onto the windscreen as the son falls back in super slo-motion with a bloodied nose (Voiceover: "...who was seating behind her without a seatbelt"). Immediately followed by the teenage daughter in the front seat screaming hysterically at the sight of her now-dead mother, and the son looking around in dazed confusion (Voiceover: "After crushing her to death, he sat back down.") The PSA is so effective it has also aired in France, Germany and Australia, and was re-made by Shell for audiences in Libya.

The full 30-minute version was shown in schools and on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>. It ends with the driver's family being hounded out of town by enraged locals and finally the end-note that she was sentenced to seven years in jail.

"Mummy, daddy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseWakeUp">wake up!"</a> Then, to the paramedic: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">When will mummy and daddy wake up?"</a> Interspersed with the vacant stare of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">baby that's obviously not going to wake up...</a> So remember: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Don't text while driving</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop">watch the road ahead of you</a></em> so you can <em>avoid</em> accidents instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">blindly plowing into them like high-velocity lemmings.</a>
</li><li> A new anti-speeding campaign shows a man who keeps seeing a dead child everywhere goes. It was a kid he knocked down. Made all the more chilling by that you <em>know</em> it's a dummy and you're still freaked out.

As silly as it may seem, the ad made it work by showing a baby fall several feet head-first on glass shattering on the pavement, and its mother letting out an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">electronically distorted, loud and echoing scream</a> in both the beginning <em>and</em> end.
</li><li> British PIFs also had, for many years, a healthy tradition of making and screening films around Guy Fawkes Night on November 5th each year. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGvIWeowU5g">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a particularly creepy one, up there with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a> as the Grim Reaper. Again, the closing echo adds a lot.
</li><li> Transport for London and Cabwise have been putting out new posters and commercials about illegal cabs. Here's the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xe7M8aKLRU">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and here's one of the <a class="urllink" href="http://i960.photobucket.com/albums/ae88/uwaaaaah/whytflwhy.jpg">posters.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> Southwark Council in London made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtQsbxvU3t4">an extremely disturbing film<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about gun crime, in which a mother pulls out a gun at the breakfast table and shoots her (about five or six-year-old) son in the head, with the child's <em>brain</em> landing in the middle of the table and blood splattering all over the kids (who all start retching and screaming). The message was that keeping quiet about who committed a shooting makes you as guilty as the offender. It has won advertising awards but is so graphic it was only permitted to be shown in cinemas before 15-rated films.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BrivBSv20Y">Tufty Squirrel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the mascot of a road safety campaign during the 1970s, beloved to people who grew up as kids during that time. He appeared in a series of films that showed children, in highly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> fashion, why they shouldn't run out into the road - Tufty's friend "Willy Weasel" was usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> who would get run over. There was also a "Tufty club" for young children to join.
<ul><li> Also worth seeing is the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DPEKVV7R9k&amp;feature=related">hilariously demented adult-themed spoof.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (warning: major childhood violation)
</li><li> One Tufty Club book included a strip in which Tufty broke a number of safety rules, and then got out of being punished by <em>bribing the grownups with invites to his birthday party</em>.

So many elements are just pitch-perfect: the simple music and dreamlike quality of the visuals grab your attention amidst the din of shouty advertising, the performances of all three actors are spot on (the grimace from the father as he faces the inevitable, the hope from the little girl, and the quiet determination from the mother), the fairy wings on the little girl giving her an angel-like quality, and the sudden violence of the impact shown by the table launching across the room. Unsurprisingly, it's gone viral.
<ul><li> An equally striking, but less successful follow-up about motorbike safety showed a child playing in the garage, pretending to ride a motorbike like his dad. It ends with the father coming home safely and hugging his son.
</li></ul></li><li> There was one that traded off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a> which started off looking like an PSA about Child Neglect with a teenager wandering around commenting on how his family didn't notice him anymore, then revealed he was dead having been hit by a car and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/think_media/241048/241151/myhouse-low.mpg">never noticed.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In late 2010, the Metropolitan Police released an audio ad featuring the distorted voice of a man screaming abuse at, and then brutally beating his partner. It concluded by asking the listener what they would do if they heard something like that going on next door.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EwanMcGregor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EwanMcGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> provided the voiceover for a Transport for London road safety campaign, showing a motorcylist going about his usual routine on the way to work: "The alarm that gets you up for work. The cereal you have for breakfast. The wife you say goodbye to. The road you cycle along ... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AdUNHkQRVA">(Crash!)

</li><li> Helen Bamber Foundation is a UK-based charity that acts for victims of human rights abuses. They have put out a few well-known PSAs about sex trafficking. One starred Hollywood actress Emma Thompson as the two separate personalities of a woman who has been trafficked: "Elena", her real identity before she was sold into sex slavery, and "Maria", the name her captors use to pimp her out. Another had a young Eastern European woman trying to do normal things like buy groceries and train tickets etc. but the only words she knows in English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels">relate to sex</a>. More horrifying was a full-length PSA dramatising the ordeal of a girl sold into sex slavery. At one point she is raped by her pimps, with visuals of blood raining down the walls of the apartment below the brothel while a family with young children is eating dinner, probably a metaphor for their guilt as they have not told the police about the gang activity.
</li><li> TV presenter Anne Diamond, whose son died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, fronted a PSA and publicity campaign encouraging parents to reduce the risk by putting babies to sleep on their backs. The campaign has been credited with helping to massively cut the number of "cot deaths" in England and Wales.
</li><li> A Neighbourhood Watch PSA showed a man breaking into a house, but neighbours gather around and begin a slow handclap to let him know they're watching him. A parody aired on the TV series <em>Beadle's Hotshots</em>, where the people are quiet until the burglar leaves the house, then they burst into rapturous applause and give him a bunch of flowers and a getaway car.
</li><li> Another crime prevention PIF involves a flock of magpies scarily marauding through someone's bedroom, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoStrings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoStrings">"Psycho" Strings</a> rifling through the knicker drawer, ripping apart soft furnishings and making off with jewellery, before a stern faced narrator points out that if you'd fitted proper locks, joined the local Neighbourhood Watch and just shut your damn doors and windows when you went out, this wouldn't have happened. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeHY4Dq_SFk">Don't Let Them Get Away With It.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Motor Neurone Disease Association has released a couple of cinema ads:
<ul><li> The first one features a still photograph of a man that fades away as he narrates:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>I am dying from Motor Neurone Disease. Every day I'm more helpless as my muscles waste away. There is no cure for my disease and no hope for me, but I want there to be hope for others.</em>
</div><ul><li> The second one featured a woman being locked into a room that's empty except for an electric wheelchair. She's then flung across the room by an unseen force, writhing and contorting in agony as she's dragged into the chair.
</li></ul></li><li> An anti-smoking PSA where a man's daughter watches glumly as he heads outside to have a cigarette. Later, he catches her looking up lung cancer in a medical encyclopaedia.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/0hySFt8O11A">Another utterly harrowing anti-smoking PIF<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured an interview with a man dying of throat cancer. His voice was raspy and grating, as he'd had his voicebox removed. He tells the interviewer, "My eldest, Alexandra, is coming over to see me on December 13th. I will be alive for that." Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack">Fade to Black</a>, and then the text: <em>Anthony died ten days after filming this. He never got to see his daughter.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> A cinema/poster/radio campaign showed kids who would have grown up to be famous pop stars, movie stars, supermodels, athletes, rappers, dancers or computer games designers, but were hit by cars and killed when they were young. Apparently, the lure of becoming a scientist or something wasn't enough ...
</li><li> The latest "Don't stand around on a level crossing and get mowed down like an idiot, idiot" ad <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-sIfsW7tg">starts out with a family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> biking through the country-side with the youngest playing "I spy something with the letter 'T'"; just before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">the older sister gets mowed down by a train like an idiot</a> for stopping on a level crossing, she stops on a level crossing like an idiot and says "Is it 'track'?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheCensors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheCensors">We cut to black as the train mows her down</a>, flash the tag-line <em>See 'Track', Think 'Train</em>' and then display the ident of Network Rail.
</li><li> British Red Cross had an ad showing a young woman walking down a dark street, informing the audience that she is the cause of their misfortunes, like the fire that causes homelessness or the boiled sweet stuck in a child's throat, because she is a crisis and she doesn't care who you are.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://talesoftheroad.direct.gov.uk/">Tales of the Road,,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> a series of cautionary tales about kids who were foolish about road safety, and the price they paid. Multiple levels of creepy, from the Belloc-esque poems to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em>-esque animation. (And let's not even get started on the fact that, while the narrator may <em>say</em> [albeit quite graphically] that they just got banged up a bit, the way they stare blankly at a re-enactment of the event while more careful kids walk past them without noticing makes them seem a lot like some kind of <em>ghost</em>.)
</li><li> There was campaign run in partnership with MTV's UK branch entitled "Carry a Knife, Lose Your Life", in an effort to discourage knife crime. The TV ads were shown in two parts; the first half shows two identical-looking young people each talking about an ambition they share in life before ending with "But I never thought..." The second half show's one person having achieved their goal in life, such as becoming a famous DJ or model, while the other person is shown being arrested by the police or sitting in a jail cell, stating they never thought they would get in trouble with the law for carrying or using knives.
</li><li> Thames Valley Police's brilliant <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZwvrxVavnQ">"Tea and Consent"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an ultra-low budget animation which uses making someone a cup of tea as a metaphor for sex, in order to dramatise the nature of consent. Part of what makes it work is the hilariously deadpan narration.
<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator</strong>: And if they're unconscious, don't make them tea. Unconscious people don't want tea, and they can't answer the question "Do you want tea?", because they're unconscious. Okay, maybe they were conscious when you asked them if they wanted tea, and they said "Yes!", but in the time it took you to boil the kettle, brew the tea and add the milk, they're now unconscious. You should just put the tea down, make sure the unconscious person is safe, and this is the important part again — don't make them drink the tea.
</div></li><li> Disrespect Nobody is a new campaign to combat domestic and sexual abuse, featuring various talking human body parts who talk about how forcing your partner into having sex or becoming violent when your partner disagrees with you on something is not cool.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz8t-ATXkQI">This advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ran throughout early 1998, to encourage people to vote in favour of that year's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement">Good Friday Peace Agreement.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The song, Marmalade's <em>Reflections Of My Life</em>, was used because (as noted in the advert) it was recorded in 1969, the same year that The Troubles began. Of course, the people of Northern Ireland voted in favour of the Agreement, partly as a result of this campaign.

Before there was videotape, there were Narmtastic PSAs.
</li><li> There was a particularly nightmare-inducing '70s PSA called "House of the Hemophiliac." It shows eerie visuals of a camera panning around a house, zooming in on ordinary objects which would present a big danger to a hemophiliac: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">knives, table corners, the cat...</a>
</li><li> There was an anti-drunk driving PSA, which was aired in the '70s. An Eric Foreman-type kid is driving his girlfriend home; he's clearly had a few and is pleasantly buzzed - then he runs into her dad's parked car, putting a big dent in it. The ad ends with her dad coming out the front door, looking not pleased. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">What a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">dumbass.</a>

It features a teenage boy, on voice over, talking about the day his sister didn't come home, the little sister out playing, and another teenage boy driving a car. The story is told out of chronological order: starting right after the collision, flashing back to the girl playing with her friends, cutting to the paramedics working on her, then cutting back to the driver texting, forward to paramedics again, then showing the driver inside the car and the sickening thud of the car hitting the girl. This ad had won a contest that CDOT held in state. For some reason, it is often shown on cable channels with a preschool/parent audience.
</li><li> Since then, AT&amp;T has gotten in on the fun, presenting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">various stories from the survivors</a> (or perpetrators) of texting-caused accidents in an effort to discourage the practice.

It also contains a hilariously lame response to an insult: "I'm not a chicken, you're a turkey!". The PSA originally aired without the Turtles, who were added years later to freshen up the old live action footage.
</li><li> The Texas Department of Transportation created an advertising campaign (with print ads and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd-QG-Yx_Ho">a TV commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) featuring a young woman named Jacqueline Saburido, the victim of a drunk driver who was burned over 85% of her body and has had to have her face completely reconstructed so she could breathe and eat independently again.

</li></ul></li><li> Related to above, the Department of Housing and Urban Development released <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qhYRWUN47s">videos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of milk bottles, baby food containers, and cereal bowls actually being filled with lead paint instead of milk, all with lullaby music playing.

</li><li> The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue aired, earlier in 2010, a rather creepy, paranoia-inducing PSA notifying taxpayers of a deadline for paying back taxes without penalty. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ES0Q8emDsg">Because, Tom, we do know who you are.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> While being in print form as opposed to commercials, consider New York City's "Two drinks ago" anti- binge drinking campaign. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/images/basas/excessive-drinking-man-lg.jpg">One<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>shows a bloodied man assumed to have been beaten up, with the caption "Two drinks ago you would have walked away."

</li><li> The 1960's "Give A Damn" campaign by the New York Urban Coalition had some notable ads, along with its famous song by Spanky and Our Gang:
<ul><li> One ad in the series inspired the setting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>. Specifically, one that parodied vacation ads - "Send your children to the ghetto this summer!" After listing off "amenities" (including "field trips" - to trash-strewn vacant lots), the actor playing the pitchman declared, "Don't want <em>your</em> kids playing here? Don't expect <em>our</em> kids to." On seeing the PSA, Jon Stone, one of the producers in charge of designing <em>Sesame Street</em>, concluded that setting the show on an inner-city street would be the best way to get inner-city kids to watch it (since they were the target audience).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuDBcpmiipI">This one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gives a first person view of a run down New York apartment, including a broken toilet, while the landlord talks about the place and the single mom who previously owned it. Towards the end the landlord asks someone if they want the place or not. The ad is then revealed to take place from the POV of a black man, who tells the landlord, "I'll take it." The point of the ad was to inform viewers of how dire the situation is for non-whites to find an apartment.
</li></ul></li><li> The similar National Urban Coalition ran a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MAdJeqE3cE">well repeated ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where numerous celebrities and politicians sing (in off-key) "Let the Sunshine In" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hair">Hair</a></em>.
</li><li> Some of the most violent, disgusting, and disturbing anti-smoking commercials come out of Florida. Oddly enough, very few of these focus on quitting smoking, but rather on trying to avoid smoking outdoors. This may be due to a high population of older people who have been addicted for an extremely long time. A particularly disturbing commercial had everyone wearing gas masks while "Ring Around the Rosie" was sung in slow-motion in the background. At the end of the PSA, the mood and music lightened as a woman on a bench was shown to be smoking instead of wearing a gas mask.
</li><li> Then there were several ads against crack, rock cocaine. One featured Paul Reubens <em>in character as Pee Wee Herman</em>, another had <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cic9djMyVl4">Clint Eastwood.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The Pee Wee one is often noted for its Narm.

The lesson here is "We're not candy." This dates back when many tablets had flavored coatings to protect the medication from oxidation. It was because they could be mistaken for candy that the flavored coatings have all but disappeared. Today, most over the counter or prescription tablets taste appropriately chalky if they have any taste at all.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BustaRhymes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BustaRhymes">Busta Rhymes</a> would later incorporate some of the lyrics from this PSA into his song "Dangerous" - outside of the original context, lines like "you should have a healthy fear of us / 'cause too much of us is dangerous" feel at home in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap">Boastful Rap</a>.

</li><li> An unusual example: This <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/eafwFq111P8">1997 Ford Windstar commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has an end tag with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Big Bird</a> and a small group of children:
<div class="indent"><strong>Big Bird</strong>: "Remember, kids in the back seat!"
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kids</strong>: "And buckle up!"
</div></li><li> Similarly, in NYC there was the "Celebrity Talking Taxi" program where celebrities recorded reminders for passengers to buckle up and take receipts for the rides, to play in all of New York's taxis. The program lasted from 1997 until 2003, when it was discontinued due to lack of interest from the public. Among those who contributed to the campaign were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark">Dick Clark</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers">Joan Rivers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock">Chris Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Elmo</a>, whose involvement was lampshaded in a TV special where he gets into a time-traveling taxi helmed by Grover and a recording of his own voice tells them to buckle up.
</li><li> In Wisconsin, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.unitedwaygmwc.org/TPP-Campaign/For-a-Good-Time-Call">there was a series of billboards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and bus stop ads that looked like they were vandalized with a note reading, "For a Good Time Call: [Phone Number]". Those who called ended up hearing a baby's cries and a teenage mom telling the caller, "You know, what's a good time now? Changing 20 diapers a day." and other similar quotes.
</li><li> From Idaho, there was <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/SAhHqt_OFt8">Teen Mommy Darci<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/WoYuxIV0Z1w">Action Teen Father,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which attempt to present the perils of teen parenting by disguising themselves as doll/action-figure commercials, respectively.(Action Teen Father also seems to imply that "Taking responsibility for your child is for losers.")
</li><li> During the famous Ellen Puppy Episode, the Human Rights Campaign attempted to run an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuFvrxWaOpk">ad called "Shoes."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1jbpi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1jbpi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1jbpi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was rejected by ABC, but the HRC ran the ad in local affiliates so it would still air during the episode.</span> It features a woman named Betty, presumed to be a lesbian, walking out of an office after being fired from her job. The other staff members are shocked when the find out she was fired, believing that her firing was unfair and illegal. The narrator then explains that, at the time, LGB workers could be fired in 41 of the 50 states. The staff members ask Betty if they could help her, and the HRC's phone number appears on screen.
</li><li> A series of blood donation PSAs portrayed situations where people had tried to do something about a social problem, only to end up making things worse. (E.g. a man begins a letter-writing campaign against a company that uses sweatshop labor, only to find out that his efforts have led to <em>more</em> child labor - and deforestation from all the wasted paper.) The PSAs then give a message that donating blood is an easier way to save the world - implying "don't try to help anyone via activism, you'll only cause more problems."
</li><li> A radio PSA for birth control from the 80s featured Dan Fogelberg's "Longer." "From saying 'no' to taking the Pill. You're too smart not to use it."

</li><li> One billboard in Los Angeles has a real time counter of smoking related deaths during the year. It was erected by a former smoker in 1987 and still remains to this day. It's even started a small tradition every New Years, as a small group of people watch the counter reset to zero at midnight.
</li><li> Energy Upgrade California has run various PSAs on preserving energy:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JoQya5Patg">A well repeated PSA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has an offscreen narrator give various things to citizens of California, before finally giving Californias "39 Million Heirs" the state's beauty, as long as they preserve it in all its glory.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4gT6ZqnPKg">A rather interesting one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> billboard. In the day, it's a normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> chicken billboard, but at night, instead of the billboard lights turning on, a glow in the dark message reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> partnership with Energy Upgrade, and calls the billboard an "energy saving billboard."

These PSAs were only mentioned by Spencer in a DVD commentary, and Grant at a convention appearance, as they were never released because the city believed their sounds were too realistic.

</li></ul></li><li> Adam Hart-Davis and "Self-assessment. Tax doesn't have to be taxing."
</li><li> "You can learn a lot from a Dummy. Buckle your safety belt." The costumes are in the Smithsonian now as tribute to how well the campaign worked not only at its intended purpose but becoming an icon immortalized in pop culture around the whole world.
</li><li> Especially creepy are the anti-smoking ads. Remember the coughing baby? How about the woman smoking out of her stoma (a hole in her neck)?
</li><li> An ad showing a young man riding his bicycle erratically, weaving through traffic, riding against traffic, and not watching where he's going, ending with, "And avoid... IMPACT!" as he slams into an opened car door, flies over it and leaves his blood and brains all over the pavement. (This was back before anyone even considered requiring helmets for anyone, let alone bicycle riders.)
</li><li> One of the more memorable boat safety ads involves the narrator noting, "You don't think you need to wear a lifejacket yourself, but you'd never risk your kid's lives." The camera shows two children forlornly looking overboard of a powerboat into the water. "Good plan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">They didn't need you anyway.</a>"
</li><li> Nemyslis zaplatis was the tagline for a series of PSA's about driving safety, there was one about the dangers of holding your baby in your arms on a car journey it is horrific.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> often releases "PSA" videos, though the only ones that weren't parodies were the two about voting (which were still humorous).
</li><li> "Simon [a boy of about 8] is about to kill his father... In a crash, [without a seatbelt] at 50 km/h, Simon is hurled forward at [n] times his weight...a 650-kilo cannonball. Imagine...an <em>adult</em>."
</li><li> A fear of trains can be safely blamed on a Special Assembly at school, where the usually non-threatening visiting policeman presented a half-hour of reasons why venturing onto railways is inadvisable. Reconstructions, interviews with bereaved parents, avuncular coppers showing safe ways to cross- all to be expected. Then, 3 still photographs of dead kiddies done in by various trainly dangers. One perched on an embankment, presumably having been flung there by a passing express. One on a slab, peaceful apart from some serious electrocution burns. The last, photographed before being scooped off the tracks, was an upper body and head shot of a 'run-over' victim; until then, it had not been clear that people struck by heavy locomotives do not politely slide under the wheels, but undergo violent dismemberment. This particular example still had an intact head and arms and the worst aspect was their <em>slightly puzzled expression</em>- a sort of "Hmm, what's that odd rumbling noise?" face. Evidently the train had struck them before they could switch to 'Argh, impending death!' An undignified fainting spell was narrowly avoided. Twelve years later, including three years of daily train journeys, and the fear remains; the conditioning worked a little too well.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK">Top Gear (UK)</a></em> did a PSA on the dangers of trying to run railway crossings in your car. The best ways to avoid getting hit by the train were to not be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">elderly driver</a> and to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">always wear your high-visibility jacket.</a> Needless to say, they received some complaints.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalLampoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalLampoon">National Lampoon</a></em> did a comic book-format PSA parody "Heading For Trouble" that managed to fit in drunk driving, starting forest fires, littering, hitchhiking, chatting on police emergency phones while dressed in commercial trademark character costumes - sublime absurdism from Brian McConnachie.
</li><li> In one episode/chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Peche, one of Nel's Fraccion, pulls his sword out of his loincloth. Dondochakka then pops up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">warns the people watching</a> not to attempt to pull a sword out of their pelvis.
</li><li> There was a PSA showing a home video of an adorable year-old baby repeating simple Spanish words for numbers from her mother. Then it shows a message saying how the baby was killed by an irresponsible drunk driver a month or so after the video was taken.
<ul><li> Many anti-drunk driving ads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappierHomeMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappierHomeMovie">use this premise</a>. Home movie footage is shown of a person who died in an accident caused by drunk driving. The most recent one featured a Marine who just graduated boot camp.
</li><li> Australia had a similar one. A father and son were driving along talking about what they were going to eat for dinner and suddenly BOOM he hits a woman. We see her mangled corpse, a bleeding baby and the 4 year old crying "DA-da-dadyyyyy * sob".
</li><li> The UK ran a similar campaign during the mid-1990s, which showed home video footage of children who had later been killed by speeding drivers, with famous voiceovers reading solemn poetry about death and grieving (including John Hannah's rendition of WH Auden's <em>Funeral Blues</em> as heard in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></em>.)

<ul><li> That one among <em>many</em> others beginning in the late-1980's, and for the most part is still included in new arcade games (in North America). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NARC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NARC">NARC</a></em>, which already had an anti-drug theme, was one of the first arcade games, if not <em>the</em> first arcade game to feature it.
<ul><li> Moreover, the laserdisc game <em>Hologram Time Traveler</em>, went a little bit further by having "Marshall Gram" (the main playable character) come out and tell the players directly, "And just remember pardner, winners don't use drugs".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> has an arcade venue where the cabinets will occasionally show the screen. It's very rare that a shot of one of the cabinets will be clear enough while it's showing this screen for a keen eye to notice the first word is "Weiners".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoctorSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoctorSteel">Doctor Steel</a></em> has made several of these covering philosophical subjects such as transhumanism, freedom of thought, and subjective reality and posted them on YouTube. He also has mock PSAs within his films <em>The Dr. Steel Show</em>, Episodes 1 and 2.
</li><li> American and British schools alike bring in either acting troupes or guest speakers, to talk about social issues such as drugs. If the show is hard-hitting enough, it has the unfortunate side effect of making arouund a third of the audience pass out or cry. Don't do drugs, kids.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> has a number of 15-second spoof PSA bumps, featuring such things as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/1046">"Educational television makes babies retarded."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> Chelsea Handler says "It's O.K. to be non-gay." in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7b4CLaclJ8#t=0m39s">this mock PSA.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeyAndPeele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeyAndPeele">Key &amp; Peele</a> have a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g-s-pghtYQ">really bizzare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> parody involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT">Mr. T</a>, where he ignores the kids talking about racism, drugs, or alcohol but immediately appears when they make a reference that could be tied back to him.
</li><li> Director Jeffrey Wisotsky in association with the Narcotics Task Force and NYC Housing Authority made a series of anti-drug PSA spots during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">mid 80s</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dM_NGlBHDU">This one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> appears to be the most straightforward one out of them. All of the PSA spots in the series were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">cheesily acted</a>, however, it's not apparent what they were aiming for with this one. Crack is like "putting a gun to your mouth and pulling the trigger!" is clear enough, but the actor's unusal delivery (coupled with a forced attempt to appear intense and seemingly voice change mid sentence) has been compared to a very odd Christopher Walken impersonation.
</li><li> "Over the Limit, Under Arrest", which showed how you can't hide how much you've been drinking. They did this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">showing people driving around with the insides of their cars filled with beer (or other alcohol), which cascades out when the car door is opened...and no doubt ruining numerous cars while filming</a>.
</li><li> There is a warning against distracted driving in end credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016">Doctor Strange (2016)</a></em> (with the film itself showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">the consequences to the title character</a>).
</li><li> The infamous UNICEF ad that showed planes and tanks bombing the heck out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfs">Smurf</a> village and lingered on the results.
