But fear not, because there are ways to pull the wool over another's eyes and never once be dishonest.
</p><p>Sometimes, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraGambit">tell the truth but no one will believe you</a> because the truth is simply too weird. Other times, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">tell the truth in a tone of voice which makes everyone assume you meant the opposite</a>. And if you are careful with your phrasing, you can pull off the highest verbal coup of all: to tell the truth, clearly and plainly, and still make everyone assume you meant something else. If others accuse you of being dishonest, you can stand behind the bulwark of your completely truthful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>. Maybe they should pay more attention next time  if there <em>is</em> a next time...
</p><p>A character who is told they'll get "what's coming to you" or "your just desserts" is almost <em>always</em> on the receiving end of this trope. At this point, in fact, such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">lines feature almost exclusively in comedies</a>, since it's just too implausible that characters in a serious drama (i.e. responding to dangerous situations with appropriate caution) wouldn't recognize the threatening subtext behind such phrasing.

Heroic characters can give False Reassurance, too; particularly when they have a secret to keep, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">can't</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotTellALie">won't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">lie to their loved ones' faces</a>.

<ul><li> If Piccolo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> says something to the tune of 'Sorry to keep you waiting', it means that he has finished charging his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Special Beam Cannon</a>, and he is most assuredly <em>not</em> sorry for what's about to follow.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Kirei Kotomine</a> has many instances where he utilises this trope, but the most memorable ones are:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a>,</em> Kirei promises to Kariya Matou that if he goes to Kotomine Church at midnight, Kariya will find his archenemy Tokiomi Tohsaka. Unfortunately for Kariya, Kirei didn't mention that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he will find Tokiomi's cold corpse and distraught <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove">Aoi</a>, who naturally believes that Kariya killed her husband</span>. It only goes downhill from there
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Shirou</a> informs Kirei about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mysterious Eighth Servant that is an irregularity in the Holy Grail War</span>. Kirei promises to investigate it. What he really means is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"I'll ask Gilgamesh why he didnt stick to the plan and stay hidden until the final phase of the Grail War."</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>,
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">Sociopathic Soldier</a> Kimblee was under orders to kill Winry's parents because they treated patients on the enemy side, but they were killed by Scar shortly before Kimblee and co. could get there. When he meets Winry years later, he puts on a charming front, informing her that his squad found their bodies after arriving "a moment too late" (though he's not lying at all when he says that he respected her parents for their dedication to their work).
</li><li> Another instance with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride/Selim Bradley</span> where he tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to Mrs. Bradley</span> that he wants to learn alchemy to help out his father. This is literally true, although he meant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">different Father</a> than his listener thought he did.
</li></ul></li><li> Xelloss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> does this very well. Notable instances include his assurances that "I absolutely will not use the Claire Bible manuscript for evil purposes", "Lord Hellmaster didn't tell me his plan", and (novel only) "His heart isn't beating". All technically true, and yet entirely misleading: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he planned to destroy, not use, the Claire Bible manuscript; Hellmaster didn't tell him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a>, but he figured it out on his own; and the "he" in question is perfectly fine, as it is really a disguised Mazoku who only has a heart when it wants to</span>.
</li><li> Used for good in an episode of the 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> series. In order to avoid putting more stress on a young blind girl, Astro impersonates the destroyed robot True and states "I'm fine! I need to go rescue more people now!" This is all technically <em>true</em> — since robots can't normally lie — but it's not coming from the person she thinks it is. Even better, True spent most of the episode reprogrammed so that he could only lie, rather than only being able to tell the truth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>'s English dub, Rip van Winkle tells the captain who turned over his ship to Millennium in exchange for vampirism: "Don't worry, you <em>definitely</em> deserve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">everything that's coming to you</a>."
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> has Kenzo Tenma severely rattled by a widow desperately asking why he hadn't operated on her husband, leading to this exchange over dinner with his fiancée.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tenma</strong>: But what does she want from me, anyway? I was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> from the Director when I performed surgery on that opera singer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepTellingYourselfThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepTellingYourselfThat">I'm not responsible</a>. (<em>To Eva</em>) Well am I? <br/><strong>Eva</strong>: Well of course not! After all, peoples' lives aren't created equal.
</div></li><li> Although the intent is fairly benevolent, Nozomu gives one to Kiri in an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>. He tells her, "If you ever feel like you want to die, let me know first." She seems to interpret this to mean "don't feel depressed, I'm here for you", but immediately after, we see Nozomu's actual meaning — because he likes Kiri, he adds her to his list of potential partners for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact">Suicide Pact</a>.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em>, Tatsumi poses as a substitute for Kagura's teacher, Ms. Wakaba. When someone asks what happened to her, Tatsumi assures them she got "A bit tied up", whereupon the scene cuts to Ms. Wakaba <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> inside a locker.
</li><li> In Episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ServantXService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ServantXService">Servant × Service</a></em>, as Yamagami noticed Hasebe is pointing his smartphone lens towards her as she tripped, she asked him not to take a picture... he asked her not to worry as he's <em>taking a video</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Arlong assures Nami that once she pays him the amount agreed on previously, he would give up control over her village as promised, and further assures her that he is a man who always keeps his word. He had already made arrangements to ensure Nami won't be able to make the payment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by having a Marine officer confiscate the money that Nami had collected over the past several years.</span>

Phrenology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>, is the "science" of measuring bumps on a person's head and using them to determine their personality traits. <em>Retro</em>phrenology works backwards, <em>applying</em> bumps to alter the patient's personality.

They weave enchantment. <br/>Elves are terrific. They beget terror. <br/>The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes, look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. <br/>No one ever said elves are <em>nice</em>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em>, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg use that belief to pull one over on basically the whole country, without ever telling an untruth. When Magrat calls them out on it, Granny responds, "We're bound to be truthful, but there's no call to be honest."

He is truthful, but not very many believe him. Lord Hong later accidentally validates Rincewind's claims by claiming that the intrusion of foreign ghosts have angered their own Agatean ghosts, who will be fighting on their side. The soldiers are less than enthusiastic about having ghosts on <em>both</em> sides, particularly since their own might be people they didn't part with on friendly terms... (It all has the result of many men deserting the army.)

This lasts until Henry, the Black Widowers' waiter, asked him if he took the cash <strong>and</strong> the securities from the safe.
</li><li> And in an inversion of the above, all the murder suspects in one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonRGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonRGreen">Simon R. Green</a>'s <em>Hawk and Fisher</em> fantasy-cop stories attest under a truth spell that, no, they didn't kill the two victims. This is correct, because the victims were killed by different suspects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>, Prince Humperdinck obtains Westley's surrender only by swearing to Buttercup that he will not hurt him. The Prince immediately turns aside to explain that he will be a man of his word and let someone else torture Westley while he watches. In a mild subversion, the Prince ultimately <em>does</em> break his word after all; it's the prince who turns The Machine all the way up to 50 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">mostly kills</a> Westley.
<ul><li> Also subverted in that while Buttercup is fooled, Westley sees right through it:

However, it is also mentioned that she's an expert in telling the truth in a way that you are led to believe something else.
<ul><li> In another Heinlein novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets">Between Planets</a></em>, the main character is told by one of the villains that his friend died of heart failure.

Unfortunately, most of them become — by necessity — masters of obfuscated speech and false reassurances. Ultimately, the oath that is meant to reassure the populace of the Aes Sedai's good intentions merely makes them distrustful of even the most straightforward statement. Everyone suspects that when an Aes Sedai speaks plainly, it means she's already figured out how to get around it.
<ul><li> People can also get false reassurance from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Aes Sedai</a>, as it is revealed that they can say something they believe to be true which is actually a load of bollocks. Thus people can occasionally say "I know such and such is true as that Aes Sedai said it" (if they aren't dismissive right off the bat) when the Aes Sedai may just be mistaken or an idiot (or both).
<ul><li> In yet another way to get false reassurance from an Aes Sedai: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aes Sedai who have sold their souls to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> have their previous oaths removed, so they can lie with impunity.</span>
</li><li> Finally, the Black Ajah swear new oaths, so there's <em>another</em> form of false reassurance, because the literal wording of the oath is that they'll never reveal their secrets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the hour of their death, so if you're good with poison...</span>

</li><li> Subverted in Frank Herbert's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em>. Baron Harkonnen promised Dr. Yueh that if Yueh betrayed the Atreides, he would stop torturing Yueh's wife Wanna and allow Yueh to join her. After Yueh does so, the Baron has Yueh killed, as he had done earlier with Wanna, thus carrying out his promise to the letter. It turns out Yueh not only knew about the Baron's plan, he accepted it, and even managed to save Paul and Jessica and give Duke Leto a chance to kill the Baron — his death is a strange moment of triumph.
<div class="indent"><em>Yueh stood, swaying. His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: "You . . . think . . . you . . . de . . . feated . . . me.

As Griphook will accept payment only in the form of the Sword of Godric Gryffindor (which they still rather need), he promises he will be given the sword, without specifying exactly <em>when</em> he would give it to him. The Goblin, however, isn't stupid, and this plan backfires spectacularly for Harry. Despite the fact that Harry <em>did</em> fully intend to give Griphook the sword just as soon as he was finished using it.
</li><li> An entire literary device. The omniscient narrator (author) tells us some information about the future which is true but which misleads the reader's expectations. John Irving likes this one and T. C. Boyle gives a (non-reassuring) example. 'I never wrote to her again'. This implies they never see each other again, but instead he simply visits (though as the ending implies they will get married and have kids, we assume he will never even send her a postcard or an e-mail).

In fact, he spends the rest of the war in Hitler's bunker, seeing the enemy reaction from the inside as the Russians advance on Berlin and the Allies sweep through Germany, finally persuading the Fuhrer to commit suicide, and does not get free until the end of the war which triggers his automatic discharge.

He doesn't have the heart to tell them about the extinction of dinosaurs on his Earth... so instead he reassures them that in his world, no conflicts ever happen between mammals and dinos, and in fact "everybody loves dinosaurs".

</li><li> Several feuds with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> began this way:
<ul><li> "Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff provided Hogan a "false reassurance" moment at the end of their tag team match against Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy, to ignite an explosive feud that raged from the summer of 1986 through the early months of 1987. Shortly before Orndorff attacked Hogan, he (belatedly) stopped the heels' 2-on-1 assault of Hogan and ran them from the ring ... but curiously they hung around ringside — and Hogan, not yet having regained his senses, not noticing — as Orndorff helped Hogan to his feet, patted him on the back and said, in essence, "It's alright, the attack is over," the trope kicking in as Orndorff raised Hogan's hand in victory ... before Orndorff viciously clotheslined Hogan to the mat, piledrove him and then called Bundy and Studd into the ring to finish him off for good. Hogan, of course, got his revenge.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy">Sid Eudy</a> also "reassured" Hogan that they were still friends, even though he was bitter at him for costing him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at the end of the 1992 Royal Rumble.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dateline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dateline">To Catch a Predator</a></em>. Many episodes feature suspects asking the question "Are you going to arrest me?", only to have Chris Hansen respond with "I'm not going to arrest you." Which he doesn't, because he's not a police officer. <em>They're</em> waiting outside.
</li><li> The classic political one (mentioned several times on this wiki) is the Finnish president assuring the Germans in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that he most assuredly would not seek a separate peace with the Soviets in exchange for Germany's offer of (badly needed) military aid. And he didn't. The next president after he resigned right after receiving the aid, on the other hand...
</li><li> In 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution, what started as peaceful protests turned into riots against the Soviet Union. In October, Hungarian P.M. Imre Nagy announced a ceasefire, declaring that the government would not treat the uprising as a counter-revolution, but as a "great, national and democratic event". Five days after the brief victory, Soviet tanks and troops invaded Budapest and suppressed the Hungarian defenders, with many arrestees being sentenced to imprisonment, concentration camp internment, or execution.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a> once fired one of his cabinet ministers, Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim, and then ordered him arrested. Ibrahim's wife went to Saddam in tears, begging that her husband be returned to her. He promised her he would indeed be returned to her the next day. Hussein kept his word, and did indeed return Dr. Ibrahim to his wife... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerInTheMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerInTheMail">in several pieces</a>.
</li><li> An old story about Czar Ivan the Terrible has him promise a rebellious city that, if they surrender, not one drop of the inhabitants' blood will stain the ground. So when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">slaughters every living soul in the city</a>, he makes sure to do it <em>indoors.</em>
</li><li> The Mongols had a habit of telling the captured leaders of the cities they conquered that none of their blood would be spilled. Which was technically true — the Mongols were extremely superstitious about shedding the blood of those of noble birth, and killed them in ways such as rolling them up in a carpet and beating them to death or tossing them into rivers in a felt sack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Nobody dies of AIDS</a>. What they die of are unrelated diseases that can proliferate unchecked by their much weakened immune system. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Though nowadays, with modern medical treatment, that's getting rarer.</a> Most people living with HIV end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllDieSomeday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllDieSomeday">living long enough to die of something else</a>.
</li><li> There are a couple of old sayings in medicine that fit this trope. "All bleeding stops...eventually," and "All fevers will come down (some of them to room temperature)."
</li><li> During one of his seminars, American travel writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RickStevesEurope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RickStevesEurope">Rick Steves</a> told attendees something along the lines of "In Europe, you won't get mugged by criminals who threaten you using a gun or a knife — that's what happens here... Instead, you are more likely to experience pickpocketing."
<ul><li> As it turns out, this isn't actually the case; while your odds of being threatened with a <em>gun</em> are much lower in Europe, the odds of being robbed with a weapon of some sort (be it a knife, club, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing">acid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or something else) aren't particularly different from that of the US. And you're still more likely to get pickpocketed.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a ferry ride in Maine where the captain, over the speaker, mentions falling overboard, but humorously reassures everyone that "No one drowns off the coast of Maine. You freeze to death long before you drown."
</li><li> When tourists take mule rides down into the Grand Canyon, the guide will warn them that the mules like to walk close to the edge of the cliffs. "But don't worry about it... because there's nothing you can do about it."
</li><li> Food labels and advertising often rely on any number of these sorts of tricks:
<ul><li> You sometimes find a tub of non-butter spread named "<em>Tastes</em> Like Butter", or something with "Real Cheese <em>Flavor</em>".
</li><li> Likewise, some products attempt to sound healthy with labels such as "fat-free" or "gluten-free", without mentioning the crapton of salt or sugar they contain.
</li><li> In the United States, most packaged foods are required to include the nutritional information labeled somewhere. A small can of soup with 25% of your daily recommended allowance of fat or salt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">per serving</a> might not sound so bad, until you look closer and see that this one little can supposedly holds 3 servings.
</li><li> Saying that something is "made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">with</a> 100% real beef/chicken/cheese/etc" isn't the same thing as saying that it's made FROM that and nothing else.
</li><li> In the U.S., some meats will be advertised as "hormone free," which is technically correct but doesn't mention the fact that the use of growth hormones in meat animals is illegal in the U.S.
</li></ul></li><li> Angered by some subversive graffiti lampooning his sister, Pope Sixtus V announced that if the writer gave himself up, he'd receive a huge cash reward and not be hanged. The man duly surrendered, whereupon Sixtus had his hands cut off and his tongue bored through instead.
</li><li> In 1642, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_George_Spencer">George Spencer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> stood trial for bestiality in Connecticut. To get him to confess, the magistrate quoted the Scripture "He that hideth his sin shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall find mercy." Unfortunately for George, once he confessed the court revealed that the mercy would be shown by God, not them. He became the first non-native person in Connecticut to receive the death penalty.
