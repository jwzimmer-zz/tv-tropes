</p><p>Alice is fully aware of Bob's faults but willingly endures the insults and troubles he dishes out because she believes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">unconditional love</a> is strong enough for both of them and/or will eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">reform Bob</a>. What separates the Love Martyr from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">Mad Lover</a> is that, in this case, Bob and Alice <em>are</em> in a relationship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste">albeit a twisted one</a>, and the love is ostensibly mutual, but he pays so little attention to her needs that his "love" for her verges on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>. Very often, others will ask "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">What Does She See in Him?</a>" or point out to Alice that Bob is a bad boyfriend, but she invariably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">ignores</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous">dismisses</a> their concerns.

If Bob has formerly shown signs of potential goodness and believably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">develops</a> into a decent person because of Alice's love, the relationship can change into a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love Redeems</a> scenario. However, the <em>less</em> evidence that is given of his basic goodness or the potential to reform, the less convincing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfRomantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfRomantic">Rule of Romantic</a> becomes, and the more it seems that Alice is sacrificing herself to sustain an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTakeAndNoGive">unhealthy relationship</a>. When the martyr is a girl and her beloved is a troubled boy, this is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a> taken to extremes.
</p><p>Frighteningly common on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> shows especially if it involves teenagers. One that comes up frequently is a teenage girl with bad self-esteem who's head over heels in love with a guy who treats her like a doormat. Often, he's also involved in something highly illegal and will drag her into it or possibly use her as a fall guy. The police often know that the guy in question is bad news, and try to offer her a deal in order to try and catch him, but she'll frequently wail out "He loves me!" and will take the fall or cover up whatever he's done, digging herself deeper in the process.

</p><p>On occasion, Alice becomes Bob's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>, and, when she dies, it prompts him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.

In the face of being completely ignored by the decidedly-unstable Shiki and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finding her standing in front of a headless corpse</span>, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decides to believe she isn't the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> and sits in her garden every night in order to watch over her. Eventually, she comes out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">smiles warmly</a>, and tries to kill him with a knife. When she realizes she can't bring herself to kill him, she throws herself in front of a car in a suicide attempt and ends up in a coma for two years, where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbrokenVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbrokenVigil">visits her every week</a> <em>even after she tried to kill him</em></span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">It seems to work</a>, insofar in that she eventually comes to care about him, and limits herself in her fights to avoid killing in the end for Mikiya's sake. But even that has the opposite effect when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that very caring makes her kill Lio when she thinks he killed Mikiya, exactly what Mikiya told her not to do</span> and Mikiya decides to stay with Shiki, saying he will have to bear her sins in her place in order to be with her.
</li><li> Electra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em> who resigns herself to just continue being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a> Nemo's surrogate daughter despite her own feelings for him, at least until his real daughter Nadia shows up again.

Hatsumi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> falls in love with Ryouki, the man who blackmails her into a master-slave relationship over a bought pregnancy test. Despite Ryouki constantly making her feel like dirt for not having her entire world revolving around him and slapping her in fits of jealous rage, she's so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">stubbornly passive</a> and so emotionally damaged by all the abuse that she sticks with him in the end because she just can't help her feelings and <em>thinks</em> that if they marry, he'll start being nice to her.
</li><li> Shuichi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em> is unconditionally in love with Yuki and lets himself be <em>gang-raped</em> for him, despite Yuki constantly belittling him, showing little affection towards him when he doesn't want sex, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">claiming that the only person he loves is a dead man</span>. Yuki does show signs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">defrosting</a> as early as Volume 1, but it takes a very long time for him to begin acting like a normal boyfriend to Shuichi.

Yes, Ataru's unfaithfulness to his fiancée is supposed to be one of the main sources of humor, but in a more serious portrayal, the question of <em>why</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">Lum</a>, who's got <em>everyone else</em> lovestruck by her, would put up with a lech like him would stick out like a sore thumb, especially when it becomes clear that her electric zaps won't stop his skirt-chasing. Ataru's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">marriage proposal</a>" to her was meant for someone else, Shinobu, in the first place.
<ul><li> This is hinted at throughout the series, more so during the ending (and final movie). Ataru may be ugly, kinda stupid, and have the biggest libido in the universe—no, really—but he genuinely is a really good person at heart.

Due to Sousuke going through extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, she can't actually even be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> in this version, considering that her reactions of lightly smacking him are an <em>under reaction</em> to the atrocities he commits. It's hard to understand why she even continues to have hopes that he'll return her feelings and treat her like a girlfriend, considering how many countless times he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentKiller">completely ruined their romantic moments</a> without remorse and generally acted like a sociopathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> maniac. Funnily, after the disaster and their ruined moment, <em>she'll</em> be the one who has an epiphany-esque, touching moment where she thinks that she "understands him a bit better now, and should have been more open-minded." Sure, quite a bit of it is played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">comedy</a>, but I'll be damned if their relationship doesn't look like an abusive one.

But all in all, he isn't shy about showing that he only really seems to care about using them for his plans to ensnare Sousuke / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">kill Sousuke's love interest</a>. It's made pretty clear to them that the only one he has eyes for is the 16-year-old boy he has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">unhealthy obsession</a> with. The fact that he ignores all the abuse they go through because of working in Amalgam (including getting repeatedly raped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Gates</a> ever since they were young) seems to be a pretty good indicator that he doesn't care much for their well being.

It's also mentioned that he has challenged her in the past; it's just she's always been able to beat him. It's also mentioned that he can't challenge her in this manner while she's engaged to Ranma (hence his fixation on attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a>) and at least <em>strongly</em> implied that as a fellow tribesman it would be neither needed or binding in the first place.

<ul><li> Misa Amane, she halves her lifespan, <em>twice</em>, for Light's sake, and is shown to be willing to do <em>anything</em> for him, since he killed the guy who ruined her life when he murdered her parents. And Light it's made very clear that he has absolutely no interest in her other than using her to kill people. Yes, even when she's only wearing sexy lingerie and is throwing herself at him. This is also the reason the readers pity her, despite the fact she is a mass murderer.
</li><li> Kiyomi Takada gets it even worse. All she wants is to be Kira's goddess. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">Oops.</a></span>

He puts up with all of Ken's abuse in the hopes that one day he would redeem himself and accept Wormmon as his partner Digimon.

In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, she's also willing to die for her unborn child that is killing her from the inside. She also risked her life to save her mother in the first book. Edward for his part suffers when he is close to Bella due to having to resist the urge to kill her, when she is in danger that she usually places herself to, when she is clearly attracted to Jacob, and risking her life by having a baby knowing full well that Edward would kill himself if she dies. He still thinks the world of her and would give his existence for her.

</li><li> More like a Lust Martyr, but Nathaniel Graison in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a> series certainly qualifies; the wereleopard, despite being in a love triangle with the series' titular character with fawning devotion to her, had become so submissive and addicted to extreme sadomasochism from his prostitute and male stripper days (to the point where his last pimp had to ensure he didn't become the willing participant in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm">Snuff Film</a></em> with any of their clients), he actually threatens to leave the triangle if Anita didn't start sexually using and abusing him like he wanted her to.

</li><li> The eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGatsby">Great Gatsby</a> is a classic example. <em>Everything</em> he does after he meets Daisy—embezzlement, less-than-scrupulous methods of becoming rich—is all done to win her heart. He even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes the blame for Myrtle's death in Daisy's place, and ends up dying for it</span>. The truly tragic part about all this is that Daisy, while she did have feelings for Gatsby, was merely a beautiful but spoiled, self-centered, and weak-willed woman who almost certainly didn't deserve Gatsby's unconditional love and devotion.

<ul><li> Basil Hallward, at least in part. He obviously cares for Dorian very much, but Dorian blatantly prefers to spend time with Lord Henry and becomes more and more evil as a result. All Basil can do is look on until Dorian <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> berates and <em>murders</em> him just for coming to visit and speaking of the rumors surrounding Dorian Gray's disreputable acts</span>!
</li><li> Dorian's fiancee, Sybil. She falls head-over-heels for Dorian, to the point that she starts to give up on her fantastic acting ability because her love makes it seem false. When he yells at her for this, since it accidentally led to his embarrassment (he brought his friends to see her perform, only for her to do a subpar job), she starts weeping and begging for him to forgive her. And that night she decides to commit suicide, which is even more tragic since Gray repented his actions the next day and was going to visit her to apologize.

Don Vicente's last words are to tell her that he was innocent, never intended to marry any other woman, and then he said before his death: <em>my cruel fortune must have carried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take my life; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me for thy husband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee for the wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.</em>

Despite Julia's abuse, selfishness, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempt to have her killed in the arena</span>, Hadassah remains Julias faithful servant and (sometimes only) true friend.

Even after she begins to love Michael back, she's flighty and angry, sometimes lashing out at him or—on two occasions—leaving him, but he still sticks by her as if she were the most upstanding and devoted wife in the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, Justine says she is willing to die for Thomas (an incubus who drains life force via sex) despite him thinking of her as "food". She proves this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRites">Blood Rites</a></em>; when Thomas has been mortally wounded and needs to feed so badly that he would lose control and kill her, she willingly goes to him, asking only that Harry tell Thomas that she loves him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She actually survives the feeding (barely) because Thomas really did love her enough to keep his ravening demon in check, and later showed that he was consciously trying to convince himself that she was just food (if he admitted to himself that he loved her, he would be unable to touch her because love burns the lust-feeding incubus, even if the love is directed at him).

</li><li> In Lois Bujold's <em>Komarr</em>, we see Ekaterin Vorsoisson, the long-suffering spouse of Etienne Vorsoisson. Possibly a double subversion; in <em>Komarr</em> she leaves him after finally having had enough, but in the next book in the series, she bitterly mourns that her feelings of regret have nothing to do with Tien, or how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> he was. Over the years, she gradually found herself with only one possession left: her word of honor, and her oath of marriage. Her guilt about leaving Tien had nothing to do with love and everything to do with breaking her own word of honor, something that meant a great deal to her and within her culture.

She seemed to "adore" Spike back only as long as he was exactly the kind of big bad strong vampire she had helped mold him into because that's what she wanted in a partner.
</li><li> He falls hard for Buffy despite her largely regarding him as a loathsome monster (granted, not unjustifiably). In "Intervention", he endures hours of interrogative torture from an omni-powerful hellgod despite knowing the information she was seeking, simply because it would hurt Buffy if he admitted what he knew and got her sister killed as a result. Then there's the fact that he goes on to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> earn himself his soul back—you know, the very thing that was inflicted on Angel as a <em>punishment</em>? Yeah, he went out and willingly got his back when he realized his lack of one would always lead to him hurting Buffy whether he intended to or not.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Harmony regards herself as such in relation to Spike. He hardly ever hid the fact that he found her annoying and was only using her for sex, and (later on) as a Buffy substitute. He even staked her just because he was irritated by her blabbering (it didn't kill her only because she happened to be wearing the Gem of Amara)—and she still came back. Eventually, when Spike tied up Buffy and Drusilla and was ranting over his spurned affections for them both, Harmony finally had enough, yelled at him for ignoring his "actual" girlfriend in favor of drooling over them, shot him with a crossbow, tried to stake him, then broke up with him for good.

</div></li></ul></li><li> "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis.
</li><li> The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus's song "Your Guardian Angel" is probably meant to sound sweet and romantic but some of the lyrics, if applied to less-than-ideal situations, seem very much to be Love Martyr talk. The song even contains the lyrics "Use me as you will/Pull my strings just for a thrill", which might give you a pause when you first hear it.
</li><li> The song "Self-Esteem" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a> is an excellent example of this trope.

She sleeps with his friends, blows him off, uses him when she's drunk, and tells him he's "like a disease". He plans to break up with her but never does. The chorus ends like this:
<div class="indent">Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <br/> But I really think it's better this way <br/> The more you suffer <br/> The more it shows you really care <br/> Right? Yeah!

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em>: This play <em>deconstructs</em> this trope by showing us the personality necessary to be a Love Martyr and that they don't even need a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> Lover to become one. This trope is <em>invoked, deconstructed, and justified</em> by Cyrano, but never <em>played straight</em> by Roxane: At Act I, he confesses to Le Bret that because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">he has an ugly nose</a>, he cannot aspire to the love of even a graceless woman. So naturally, hes in love with the most beautiful woman, Roxane. When Le Bret <em>lampshades</em> that Cyranos charisma can win Roxane's love and urges him to confess, Cyrano <em>invokes</em> this trope saying that his only fear is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Roxane mocking him after that</a>. After Act II, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">is clear for the audience, but not for Cyrano</a>, that Roxane would never do such a heinous act. Cyrano still doesnt accept it and prefers to <em>invoke</em> this trope again helping the fair Christian to win Roxanes love. This trope is <em>deconstructed</em> and <em>justified</em> showing exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">the type of guy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">who can play this trope</a>, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDelusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDelusion">guy doesnt even need a real motive (is clear Roxane never was the JerkAss lover Cyrano imagines)</a>. At Act IV, after an ultimatum, Christian forces Cyrano to confess, and Cyrano seems he could <em>avert</em> this trope for only a moment until he would <em>invoke</em> it again after Christian death. <em>Justified</em> because Cyranos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommyIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommyIssues">personality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrdomCulture">upbringing</a> forces him to be the Love Martyr.

<ul><li> Pretty much all the characters are this towards their romantic interests. Orlando is this for Rosalind and Oliver is this for Celia, and Touchstone ends up being this for Audrey. Of course, it was mandatory that men particularly at least claimed they were this in poetry, at the time: so pretty much all of Shakespeare's plays contain at least one actual example.

Honey is at the end of her long lifespan as a spirit, but Sarunan refuses to accept this and ties his lifespan to hers until they can find a body to place her in. This causes immense strain due to how much of his life he needs to give to her, to the point where he's only barely clinging to life at the age of 22 and will most definitely die before the age of 30.
