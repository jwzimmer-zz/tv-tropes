But sometimes heroes can't use the latest equipment: it may have been destroyed, stolen, confiscated, or rendered inoperable (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarfareRegression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarfareRegression">obsolete</a>) by the enemy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienSpaceBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienSpaceBats">Alien Space Bats</a>. So what do they do? They take the older stuff out of storage and make do with it. And more often than not, the ancient devices <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">still work just fine.</a>

</p><p>There is a certain degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> involved in this trope. Often the newer and more "advanced" a technology is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">the more points of failure it can have.</a> Older technologies may not be as efficient, however, they can still get the job done without the drawbacks of the newer technology. For example: compare attempting to navigate by GPS versus celestial navigation. Yes, the latter isn't as precise of a method, however, it doesn't rely on complicated electronics that can malfunction, be jammed, run out of power, etc. On any clear night, a knowledgeable mariner can easily use the stars to get to where he needs to go.

<ul><li> The entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UchuuSenkanYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UchuuSenkanYamato">Uchuu Senkan Yamato</a></em>, although the <em>Yamato</em> has been extensively retrofitted with state-of-the-art weaponry (including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>) and the engines have been replaced so it can complete its mission <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a> Although the hull had some changes done during all the series, the Wave Motion Gun's place at the bow doesn't change appearances a lot. Meanwhile, the bridge is an all-new Space-age and even has pointy glass protectors, as well as a set of wings on the very top. And the funnel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is now housing <em>several</em> missiles</span>, and the entire stern was sort of just cut off and instead you have a massive rocket booster powered by the almighty Wave Motion Engine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fun fact, the Wave Motion Engine actually works with vacuum as explained in the original series and the 2013 remake, making it seem like a glorified "Space vacuum cleaner"</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>:
<ul><li> 'Wild Horses', the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em> makes an appearance — a crazy old man has spent the last couple of decades restoring it to working order, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and pulls it out on one last flight to save the day when Spike's state-of-the-art Swordfish space-fighter is disabled by a computer-virus. It turns out that the old man has also given the Shuttle much-improved engines, as it's able to take off conventionally on a runway and reach orbit under its own power (without the aid of booster rockets), neither of which the real-life Shuttles could do. And for added museum-piece value, it's towed out of the hangar by a WWII-era tank. The rescue is a success, but the shuttle is thoroughly trashed during the reentry and landing (note also that this episode originally aired <em>before</em> the real <em>Columbia</em> accident.)</span>
</li><li> There was also the episode "Speak Like a Child" where Faye receives an old Betamax tape that might contain clues to her past, so Spike and Jet scour the solar system looking for a working Betamax VCR.
</li><li> Towards the end of the movie a number of museum piece aircraft are brought out. Some of the designs don't exist yet and some are museum pieces in the present day. Unlike usual, many of them are in... less than ideal working condition. Thankfully the pilots all had parachutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91">Mobile Suit Gundam F91</a></em>, a crazy old man brings out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Transforming Mecha</a> tank literally from a museum to fight off the Crossbone Vanguard invaders... and gets severely thrashed by their newer machines.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final battle between Setsuna and Ribbons sees them trashing their incredibly powerful new Gundams and forced to pilot their originals, Exia and 0 Gundam (albeit with some upgrades).</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer">00 movie</a>, the Earth Federation whips out every battle capable machine they have available in the face of the ELS threat. As a result, brand new GN-XIV's are fighting alongside old Tierens and Realdos.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, the Tallgeese is the first military mobile suit ever made, but it was never used because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">it was so overpowered that it killed all the test pilots</a>, hence OZ and the like settle for the Leo, a mobile suit which is much weaker but is also far easier to pilot without killing oneself just from the G-forces involved. When the Gundams appear and start ripping the Leos limb from limb, a student of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Zechs Merquise's</a> suggests using the Tallgeese specifically <em>because</em> it's overpowered, meaning it might match the Gundams, which it did. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the anime when a soldier comments he didn't know Zechs flew "antiques".
</li><li> The EMS-04 Zudah in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo">MS IGLOO</a> is a peculiar example. Having lost out to the Zaku I for the role of Zeon's main fighting machine (due to a habit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">exploding when flying too fast</a>), the prototype Zudah are later pulled out again, renumbered the EMS-10 and touted as new superweapons in a desperate bid of propaganda. The explosive truth was quickly discovered by the enemy, however, and only the suit's genuinely high performance makes up for it.
</li><li> In episode 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em>, the Zeon Remnants of Earth take to attacking the EFSF's Torrington Base with One Year War relics, with their commander even going to battle in a modified Zaku I, although Loni has the Shamblo, courtesy of the Sleeves. The Sleeves themselves supplemented the attack (and earlier, defended Palau), with a mix of new mobile suits and a couple from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Gryps Conflict</a>. The attack was effective but ultimately ended in failure once the remnants lost their advantage when the Shamblo's psycommu malfunctions and Loni goes berserk, even more so when the Byalant-Kai and the Jesta team arrive.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jesta Pilot:</strong> What is this, some kinda walking war museum!?
</div><ul><li> Not to be outdone, the EFSF also broke out infantry use, guided anti-MS missiles, like the ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo">Lieutenant Barberry</a> and his anti-MS teams used and their own Gryps Conflict mobile suits. The Gryps Conflict, admittedly, isn't too long ago for the time's mobile suits to be considered obsolete (just nine years) as they're still being widely used by all sides.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>'s earlier attack on Dakar was much more successful, with the Juaggu lasting longer and doing more damage than the newer Capule against the Federation defenders.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of the Gryps Conflict, during the Second Invasion of Jaburo, the Titans haul out various variants of One Year War Mobile Suits to defend the base. These suits are easily no match for the invading AEUG <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and besides, they're just there to lull to the group into a false sense of security as the base is set to go up in nuclear fire.</span>
</li><li> Biggest example in the series happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam">Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam</a>: Ghost</em>, where Font Baud pilots a <em>70-year-old Zaku II</em> during the era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>. Bonus points for said Zaku II <em>literally</em> being found in a museum.
</li><li> In <em>Victory Gundam Outside Story</em> (a manga side story of the anime), Grey Stoke pilots the Gump, which is actually the 65-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam</a> with makeshift replacements for one hand and foot, and a barrel over its distinctive head to conceal its identity. Unlike the above-mentioned Zaku II, this one wasn't taken from a museum because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grey Stoke is actually an elderly Judau Ashta and the Gump/ZZ Gundam has been in his possession for its entire existence</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em> also has the Earth forces discover long-buried, ancient mobile suits (namely, a bunch of Zakus ("Borjanons") and Capules ("Kapools"), plus one Turn A Gundam) and use them against the invading Moonrace.

<ul><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> comic has a thief stealing the new (red/gold) armor, so Tony has to put on the old (grey) armor to face him. The new armor is superior in almost every way, but Tony has two advantages. He's more experienced in using <em>his</em> armor (and thus knows the weaknesses of it), and the old suit is said to be stronger.
<ul><li> Iron Man recycles this bit periodically; his most common 'museum piece' is the Mark IV armor that debuted in the 1970s, using variations of this suit when his latest armour has been destroyed and he lacks the time, resources, or inclination to just create a more advanced replacement immediately.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a></em>, when Tony brought one of his old suits out... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so that he could use it to get to Iron Man Six, <em>a heavily armed, space-capable weapons platform</em>.</span>
</li><li> Subverted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">rehab armor</a> from issues #191-199; although physically resembling his original gray suit, and not as powerful as the red-and-golds Rhodey wore at the time, the internal technology was more advanced. The rehab armor even eliminated an exploit of the red-and-gold (one which Tony himself took advantage of when he had to stop a rampaging Rhodey) — it replaced the old hip-mounted power packs with an internalized power source, a design element that carried over to later armors.
</li><li> Exemplified in issue 300, the debut of the original Iron Legion. After the telepresence armor was trashed by Ultimo and Tony needed time to recover and complete his modular armor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> enlisted Eddie March, Happy Hogan, Carl Walker, Michael O'Brien, and Bethany Cabe to don older Iron Man suits to join him in holding off Ultimo.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0y06o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0y06o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0y06o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Cabe was the only one who hadn't previously filled in temporarily as Iron Man, but Rhodey picked her because she knew Tony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> and could hold her own in a fight. O'Brien and Walker had also had their own armored identities, as the Guardsman and Force, respectively.</span> Abe Zimmer, who readied the armors, noted that they had been stored without any thought of sending them into battle again.

In <em>Iron Man</em> #175, Rhodey slagged all of the armors except the "classic" red-and-gold suit he was currently wearing, in order to keep them out of the wrong hands after Tony had lost Stark International; the Centurion was destroyed by Firepower in #230, near the end of the Armor Wars. Walker wore the "classic" suit, which had been damaged the last time Rhodey had worn it in issues #215-216, while Cabe wore the "neo-classic" suit Tony had worn between issue #231 and #280</span>.

While trying to move undetected, the group finds themselves in the Guardian's vault where the original prototype for the green lantern rings is kept; a gauntlet and a backpack power source.

The <em>Missouri</em>'s main battery guns are capable of firing shells weighing nearly a ton and a half around 20 miles and are among the most powerful <em>practical</em> artillery pieces ever built. If what you need is purely ballistic firepower and you need it to be able to <em>move</em>, even today it would be hard to do better than Mighty Mo. There have been bigger guns (for example, the German <em>Gustav</em> gun could fire seven-ton shells almost 30 miles), but to move it you either have to already have a rail line handy or build one for it and once you get it there it still takes a team of 250 men over two days to actually assemble it. Another reason is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's the only remaining warship within the shield; the three modern destroyers having been blown up by the aliens, and the rest of the Navy is outside the shield</span>.

Sir Handel is having to do everything because Peter Sam is having some minor repairs done. Then he gets derailed, leaving him unsuitable for any more pulling that day. They have no choice but to use Skarloey, who had been retired to a side shed when Sir Handel and Peter Sam arrived, to pull the afternoon train.

</li><li> Another example can be found in "Super Rescue" in the book <em>Enterprising Engines</em>. Henry, suffering mechanical damage himself, is able to rescue not only one but two trains hauled by then-state of the art diesels that have broken down. One of the Scottish twins (no younger than 59 when the book was published) takes over the goods train; the passenger train is taken over by visiting locomotive <em>Flying Scotsman</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Stewart Cowley's <em>Terran Trade Authority</em> universe features this trope in the Laguna Wars in <em>Great Space Battles</em>. The centrally controlled human battlefleet is vulnerable to the Lagunans' control-systems disorientation weapon and the manual backup systems are grossly suboptimal, so the mothball fleet of a previous era — actually <em>designed</em> for independent manual control — is hauled out of retirement. In the last-ditch defence of Earth against a powerful enemy fleet, the disorientation device is destroyed and the modern ships win the day, but when they push into enemy territory they find that the ultimate strategic victory has already been won by the museum fleet.
<ul><li> Specifically, the old ships successfully blockaded the importation of a necessary substance, which turned out to be a fungicide that was the only thing keeping the Lagunan capitol world habitable. The Lagunans had the choice to go out with a bang or a whimper, and their attack on Earth was the last "fuck you" in a war they'd already lost — by the time it had begun, every Lagunan on the homeworld was dead.

<ul><li> When the BWM ends up in a (short-lived) shooting war with the Terran Confederation in <em>The Price of Freedom</em>, this trope gets deconstructed as the well-equipped Confed forces tend to steamroller over the Border Worlder forces until they are able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype">liberate some modern hardware.</a> They only fare as well as they do because many of their pilots are battle-hardened veterans of the Kilrathi War, and because their ships, while very obsolete, have also seen some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">extensive upgrades</a>.

</li><li> While not technically museum pieces, in the Jack Ryan novel <em>The Bear and the Dragon</em>, the Russians, being invaded by the Chinese, call up their reserves and put them in vintage-yet-pristine, never-before-used T-34 tanks. While the T-34 was the best, most powerful tank of its day, its day was World War 2, and despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of them, no one knows if their outdated weapons will even be effective against the Chinese T-90 tanks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They then prove that they <em>are</em>, by catching the Chinese after cutting their supply lines and utterly immolating them with minimal losses.</span>

When asked how long it would take to get the ship back to active service, his reply of "4 weeks" stuns everyone into disbelief. He does, however, point out that it's utterly incompatible with modern computer and sensor systems, and a complete refit would require cutting up the ship and putting it back together, which would take a lot longer than 4 weeks.

They're not allowed contemporary equipment like cellphones or laptops. The surveyor freaks out when she finds out that the one concession to their group, her assault rifle, is nothing more than 30-year-old parts cobbled together.

</li><li> Peter Grant of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> series employs this trope quite a bit because so much of The Folly's equipment and household fittings haven't been updated since the 1940s. Thus, he uses an antique brass microscope that <em>belongs</em> in a museum to examine a damaged 21st-century microprocessor, and the shooting-range paper targets he trains on look like German troops from World War I.

But when the Island is attacked by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tartessos</span>, they deploy the "Cherokee Brigade" - a force of SUVs (mostly Jeep Cherokees) equipped with machine guns, which are far faster than any other landbound force.

<ul><li> If the Planet of the Week has forgotten what the Stargate <em>is</em>, then it is often found at an archaeological site, in a museum, or in storage.
</li><li> Also in a less literal sense, one episode had Bra'tac break out an old version of the Death Glider that has a small enough wingspan to pass through a stargate. The "Needle Threader" variant was specifically designed for gate travel. However, so few Jaffa could pilot it without crashing into the gate that the model was retired. Teal'c manages to do it without any previous training. The Ancients' Puddle Jumpers are much older but are also much more superior to the Death Gliders. They can "thread the needle" as well (in fact, it's one of their primary functions, hence the nickname), but many of the control functions are automated, so it's a lot easier.

Bandits invade the gathering and hold the nobles for ransom. The Grey boys and their sister have to save the day by using the old weapons from the Duke of Arundell's collection. Note that this show already takes place in the Middle Ages, so the heroes fighting the bandits are using weapons even more ancient than that! Tenth to Twelfth-century rather than Fourteenth — and yes, there was a difference!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CovertAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CovertAffairs">Covert Affairs</a></em>, an encoded radio transmission turns out to be in such an outdated cypher that a clunky old museum piece is pulled out of the CIA's archives in order to decrypt it.

The clearest example is when Hodgins actually manages to vaporize some of the metal shrapnel and analyze it. Justified because they work IN a museum.
</li><li> In "The Male in the Mail", when Hodgins is unable to identify a body's bone striations by comparing them to conventional blades, he announces, "It's time to get medieval." He runs comparisons on antique weapons, finding a close match to a guillotine, which leads Booth and Bones to identify an industrial paper-cutter used at a shipping depot as the murder weapon.
</li><li> And in "The Corpse in the Canopy", the lab has shut down all networked computers and stopped using phones because of a psychopath computer-expert. Hodgins communicates with Booth using two WWII Enigma code machines — one from his family's private collection and the other presumably from the museum.
</li><li> Hodgins "borrows" another piece from the Smithsonian in a tenth-season episode: a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_recording">wire-player<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the era that pre-dates cassette tapes to play back some wire left over from a 1960s recording.

<ul><li> During the Dominion War, we routinely see parts of the Federation fleet are made up of <em>Constellation</em>-, <em>Miranda</em>- and <em>Excelsior</em>-class vessels, which initially debuted <em>over a hundred years ago</em> and are <em>still</em> in active service. It's implied that some of these vessels were even taken out of mothball to replace lost ships and still manage to hold their own.
</li><li> The <em>Miranda</em> and <em>Excelsior</em> classes were actually in constant use for over 100 years, but the early models were usually mothballed after a while. But Starfleet kept building new ones with updated electronics and engines (they turned out to be far more economical than the massive <em>Galaxy</em> and <em>Sovereign</em> classes), so pulling the old ships out of retirement and bringing them up to modern standards was easy.
</li><li> In-universe, the Starfleet Corps of Engineers were considered to be at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> level. A Vorta (one of the enemy races in <em>Deep Space Nine</em>) once stated that a Starfleet engineer could turn "rocks into replicators".

<ul><li> Meta example in "In A Mirror, Darkly" in which the mirror crew take over the USS <em>Defiant</em> from the primary universe.

<ul><li> Modern video equipment, caused by converting signals from analog to digital and back again, as well converting signals from one video format to another, can create latency in video. This can be disruptive to live theater performances, where an off-stage chorus might need to follow a musical conductor by video camera. Fifty milliseconds might be borderline tolerable; by the time the lag gets to 100 milliseconds, a production would be in serious trouble. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOgsmff0RPs">This video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> provides a good demonstration.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> justifies the use of this trope right from the start of the game. As a cadet fresh out of the academy, your first assignment just happens to take you into a Borg invasion of the Vega Colony. Your captain sends you and a skeleton crew to over to a derelict <em>Miranda</em>-class vessel in the middle of battle. After you get it back up and running, you fight to help beat back the Borg. The conflicts and tension throughout the Alpha Quadrant have grown as such that Starfleet allows you to remain in command of your new vessel just out of sheer NEED to make sure they can defend themselves and breaks out other outdated vessels like the <em>Constitution</em>- and <em>Oberth</em>-class vessels just because they're better than nothing.
<ul><li> Heck, even the mighty <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Galaxy</a></em>-class which was once the most advanced and powerful ship in Starfleet's arsenal is now 60 years old in the game's timeframe, and it is outclassed in the offense department by nearly every other Federation cruiser, yet it can still throw down with the best of them if commanded by a skilled captain. It also bears the distinction of being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">toughest ship</a> to bring down in the game if its captain knows what he's doing.
</li><li> Averted in all but spirit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">NX-Series ships</a>: while they are (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>) the oldest ship designs Starfleet has, the store fluff explicitly mentions that the NXes the player can buy are <em>replicas</em> made with current ship tech specs (like getting a composite '50's Chevy body replica for your state-of-the-art roadster's frame).
</li><li> The Daedalus Temporal Science Vessel on the other hand, is a Daedalus Class Science Vessel (best known for a model of the ship sitting on Sisko's ready room desktop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>) that is a rough contemporary of the NX-series and veteran of the Earth-Romulan War, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">taking this trope to its stretching point</a>, being officially phased out by the time of the <em>Original Series</em>, ripped from time and space and retrofitted with a Temporal Destabilization Probe as well as slightly less obsolete armaments. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5afqd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5afqd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5afqd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which means that, unlike the replica NX, these vessels are actual 22rd-century starships, making them the oldest playable vessels in the game!</span>
</li><li> The Klingons and (based on revealed information about their playable faction) the Romulans does the same, with use of the <em>K't'inga</em> (i.e., D7, i.e., the Klingon <em>TOS</em> battlecruiser) and the <em>T'liss</em> (i.e., the <em>TOS</em> Romulan Bird-of-Prey) classes. The starting <em>T'liss</em> turns out to be even more of this than the starting <em>Miranda</em>, as it's not just an old design, it actually <em>is</em> a <em>TOS</em>-era ship the local big guy took with him when he retired and kept around just in case.

When Prometheus unleashed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">The Fire</a>" on humanity, ITS Cybrid forces completely decimated the remaining portion of the world's military forces still under human control.

Many of the people at the facility, both historians and technicians, were veterans of past wars, and so had plenty of combat experience. With the skills and facilities on hand to repurpose their museum pieces for combat, they took the fight to the Cybrids.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> uses this often. The titular rebels often have to find and salvage leftovers from the Clone Wars to help gear up for a fight against the Empire. The success of this varies widely.

<ul><li> Most modern armed forces have contingencies in place to store outdated and obsolete equipment in case it's needed again. One example would be the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/309th_Aerospace_Maintenance_and_Regeneration_Group">Boneyard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which stores thousands of old and unused aircraft ready to be repaired and restored if needed.
<ul><li> Somewhat averted with the Cold War thawing in the 1990s. As part of force reduction agreements, observers from the Soviet Union were invited to witness surplus British Chieftain tanks being destroyed to the point where they could not be used again. Similarly, British and American observers officially witnessed surplus Soviet tanks beginning the long road into becoming ploughshares.
</li></ul></li><li> When World War I broke out in 1914, the nations involved had smokeless powder bolt action rifles that would have been considered state-of-the-art for the time. However, none of these nations were prepared for the massive attrition in men and equipment that modern warfare would bring. Rifles were being lost/destroyed faster than replacements could be manufactured. Priority was given to front line units so real echelon and support units had to give up their rifles and were instead issued older rifles that the army had officially deemed obsolete but still had plenty stockpiled in arsenals. When the army started running low on rifles again, it would institute another shift as the real echelon weapons were sent to the front and even older stockpiles of weapons were brought forward. The less vital a unit was, the older weapons they would end up. So a railroad guard far from the front might be given a single shot black powder rifle that was made in 1870 and really should be in a museum.
</li><li> Examples in WWII:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_%28United_Kingdom%29#Equipment_and_training">UK Home<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard">Guard</a>, aka 'Dad's Army.' They carried anything they could use, in the desperate situation of 1940-41, when the UK had lost most of its materiel at Dunkirk; some personnel even carried pitchforks. The best-equipped units were drawn from rural areas, arming themselves with privately-owned shotguns and game rifles. The US, violating neutrality, sent over all the rifles it could scrape together (including from the NRA). Enfield hastily designed <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten">an SMG that could be built by the village blacksmith<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and a number of creative solutions to problem of German armour were developed by the Home Guard themselves. By late 1941, the situation was back under control — although <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_%28United_Kingdom%29#.22Croft.27s_Pikes.22">not everyone had gotten the message<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The UK Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm used the Fairey Swordfish, "The String Bag", a biplane design commissioned in 1936. It would have been helpless against enemy fighters (like most of the war's torpedo bombers), but it had an advantage against enemy AA: WWII rangefinders couldn't predict the flight path of anything that slow. Thus, attacks by Swordfish sank much of the Italian Navy in its home port of Taranto, and crippled the <em>Bismarck</em> in its breakout attempt in the North Atlantic, both times with negligible British losses.
<ul><li> The Mk.III Swordfish had a very bulky radar instead of the 18" torpedo the Mk.I had. The slow speed of the Swordfish meant that it could stay aloft for several hours and provide early warning about German submarines long before the lookouts and ASDIC/Sonar/Radar on Allied escort vessels could detect them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Swordfish had the advantage of being so slow that an attacking fighter had to slow to almost stalling speed to be in with a fleeting chance. It was also surprisingly manoevrable: this combined with its exceptionally slow airspeed allowed it to evade fighters moving four times more quickly but which could not stunt as well. These factors also explained the survival of Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters in the air battles over Malta.
<ul><li> The outdated fabric skin also proved an advantage, since it did not provide enough resistance to detonate cannon shells that struck limiting damage. One aircraft from HMS Ark Royal returned with over a hundred and seven five holes in the wings a fuselage, while another limped home minus its entire floor.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the Soviet Air Force's 588th Night Bomber Regiment flew Polikarpov Po-2 wood and canvas biplanes. Like the Swordfish they were too slow for enemy fighters to properly engage, plus the pilots would cut the engines glide almost silently over their targets. Being an all-female regiment, the Germans nicknamed them the Night Witches.
</li><li> The Hawker Harrier jump-jets used in the Falklands, despite slow subsonic speeds, also used similar tactics to successfully fight Argentinean jet fighters whose weapons were designed to take down other supersonic aircraft.
</li><li> Nazi Germany assumed, at the beginning of the war, that horse cavalry were obsolete, but by 1942, they'd changed their minds. Infantry were too slow to catch Cossacks and mounted partisans, and tanks couldn't enter rocky ground and forests (which cavalry certainly could); the result was about ten divisions of German cavalry. Horses also had to be called upon frequently to transport equipment that had specifically been designed to be towed by vehicles for lack of vehicles or fuel. In fact, 80% of the heavy equipment used by Germany in WWII was horse-drawn, despite the popular image of Germany in WWII as an entirely mechanized modern force.
</li><li> During the early stages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the Norwegians sank the heavy cruiser <em>Blücher</em> with weaponry which they'd bought decades before, and which was obsolete even then. Ironically, the guns were sold to them by the German armaments firm Krupp in the 1890s.
</li><li> Partisans of any kind, naturally, used any guns they could get their hands on. In extreme cases, this included 19th-century rifles, hunting rifles, and even ancient flintlock pistols. Some were less fortunate and had to make do with pitchforks, axes, picks, or improvised spears.
</li><li> One of the most famous examples among wargamers is when the Germans, running short on panzers, reintroduced the obsolete French tanks they had captured back in 1940. Many of these saw action in Normandy, and some were used for anti-partisan duties.
</li><li> The Germans hoped to establish a Victory Museum where examples of captured tanks would be put on display. Example tanks from all defeated nations were meticulously collected and housed in a facility on the Baltic coast. These were impressed into a scratch panzer battalion in 1945 and thrown into the battle against the Russians.
</li><li> The Dutch army was totally unprepared for an invasion, so much so they fought with 19th-century weapons. Not played straight though, as much of the weaponry was never in the museum. The army just meant to use all these things due to extremely low budget.
</li><li> During the Battle of Crete, a Greek priest and his son broke into the village museum and stole pre-World War I weapons to use against the German paratroopers.
</li><li> World War II would be the last time several older wooden sailing ships saw their last useful service, though firmly in auxiliary roles. For example, the <em>USS Constellation</em> (not the be confused with the more famous <em>USS Constitution</em>) was recommissioned for use in an administrative role after being reserved for museum duty. HMS Victory was also used for such a purpose in the war, though she technically had been filling such a role since long before the war broke out.
</li></ul></li><li> Examples featuring WWII equipment:
<ul><li> Some Taliban snipers in Afghanistan still use British Lee-Enfield rifles (or locally manufactured copies), which were designed in the 1880s and, with little refinements and the rare rechambering to NATO-standard ammunition, used in one role or another for close to a hundred years. The Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle is much more popular due to using the same rounds as the PKM medium machine gun and the huge surplus of Russian/Chinese 7.62x54mmR ammo in Taliban armories. Like the Lee-Enfield, it was designed in the 1880s and used in both World Wars.
</li><li> Their Iraqi counterparts prefer its Nazi rival, the Mauser Karabiner 98k (designed in 1935, as a cut-down version of the Mauser Karabiner model 1898).
<ul><li> And the Coalition forces tend to favour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BayonetYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BayonetYa">bayonet charges</a> against the Taliban on close quarters: the Taliban are said to be very wary of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">melee fighting</a>. Bayonets themselves are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Falklands War, the British took a WWII field kitchen truck from the Imperial War Museum and sent it along with the Task Force sent to fight off the Argentines, since there was no modern equivalent that could prepare hot meals in the field.
</li><li> Before they had their own defense industry (i.e., the Yom Kippur War and all previous conflicts), the Israelis relied on upgraded, surplus tanks. In the Yom Kippur War, they defeated more modern Soviet tanks with heavily upgraded Shermans — proving that in the right hands and with the right modifications, even a thirty-year-old design can defeat much newer ones.
<ul><li> Since developing their own defense industry, the Israelis have actually made a fair amount of money off of upgrading older US tanks for other countries.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch2en/conc2en/img/dc3.jpg">Douglas DC-3<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, the first successful commercial airliner and probably the best transport aircraft of WWII (Stalin certainly thought so, and built it under license in huge numbers), is still in use today all around the world. "The only replacement for a DC-3," the saying goes, "is another DC-3."
</li><li> During the Cold War, a squad of SAS commandos were tasked with defending an Omani fort when they were suddenly attacked by hundreds of Communist guerrillas. In desperation, a couple of the SAS soldiers rushed over to a nearby shed that housed an antique WWII era artillery piece. They managed to get it working and it proved to be the deciding factor in the fight, buying them enough time for reinforcements to arrive.
</li><li> During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, some mujahidin preferred to fight Hinds with WWII AA guns instead of the US-supplied Stinger missiles.
<ul><li> Keep in mind that the Stinger missiles of the era were an utterly hideous thing to fire, leaving the man firing them in a dense cloud of toxic smoke that also showed the enemy precisely where he was. A WWII AA gun under appropriate camo netting is damn near impossible to spot when not actually firing, by which point it's too late for the target if the gunner is good. Also, an optically guided system relying on Human Eyeball Mark One cannot be taken out by a counter-measures missile designed to track radar or other detectable emissions back to its source and is more than enough for dealing with helicopters, which are much slower than WW2-era aircraft.
</li></ul></li><li> Soviet T-34 tanks are still in use in several African countries.
</li><li> Even into the 1970s, former French and Belgian colonies in Africa saw <em>First World War</em> surplus tanks, such as the Renault FT-17, in regular use by guerillas and local militia. The tanks had originally been relegated there in the 1920s for police duties.
</li><li> Israel's very first tanks were the French Hotchkiss tanks, built way back in the thirties and then considered far behind the technology curve. Still, they were better than no tanks at all.
</li><li> The Soviet Union captured numerous German AFV's during World War 2, which it then sold off to client states. One of the most prominent was Syria, who used long-barreled Panzer IVs and Sturmgeschütz III assault guns. They then used them in combat against Israel during wars in the sixties. By the time of the Six Day War, most of them had been destroyed, stripped for spare parts, or turned into static fortifications on the Golan Heights. A number were also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">captured by Israel then later used and issued in reserve forces</a>.
</li><li> Due to budget issues, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Special_Operations_Group">Philippine Naval Special Operations Group<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has had to re-issue old M3 and M3A1 "Grease Guns" in the place of more modern weapons like the M4A1 Carbine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Several of these have been fitted with integral silencers and Picatinny rails to use modern optical sights</a>, and still work very well. Meanwhile, Filipino marines still use M3A1s for boarding ships.
</li><li> A few nations still use <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M8_Greyhound">M8 Greyhound armored cars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in limited roles, often in military reserves or as police vehicles. One notable deployment example was when the military of Bogata used Greyhounds as security vehicles for a visit by President George W. Bush. The Mexican army also uses Greyhounds with modern autocannons and digital camouflage.
</li><li> Restored and sometimes modified WWII fighter planes, known as "warbirds", are extremely popular with civilian racing pilots. They remain some of the fastest and most powerful propeller-driven planes ever built, and they are simpler to maintain than jets—to say nothing of the slim availability of cutting-edge jet designs to civilians. The P-51 Mustang is especially prized.
</li></ul></li><li> The standard weapon issued to the Canadian Rangers (the militia force based in the Arctic) was the No. 4 Lee-Enfield, first produced in 1939 and out of service with the regular Canadian military since the 1950s. The rifles were finally replaced beginning in 2015... with <em>another</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/06/25/replacement-selected-for-canadian-rangers-lee-enfield-rifles/">bolt-action rifle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, because the extreme conditions play merry hell with anything more mechanically complicated (specifically, automatic and semi-automatic weapons are known to freeze up and jam in weather that cold). The only reason the No. 4 was replaced at all was that spare parts were running out.
<ul><li> The Canadian Army's sidearm is the Browning Hi-Power, still a commonly available pistol. The Army's guns, however, were models built under licence by Inglis Canada in <em>1944</em>.
</li><li> Likewise, the Danish Navy's Sirius Patrol, who operates in Northern and Eastern Greenland, are equipped with M1917 Enfield bolt action rifles. It's the only weapon that's reliable enough, while still packing enough punch to take out a charging polar bear.
</li><li> Many bolt-action WWI-era rifle designs, such as the American M1903, French Lebel, Russian Mosin-Nagant, and German Mauser G98, are just as reliable in Arctic conditions. The British SMLE (Short Magazine Lee-Enfield) is the best of the bunch for three reasons. First, an SMLE has a 10-round magazine (most others have 5-round magazines). Second, an SMLE is safer to use because the firing pin is not cocked while the bolt is being opened (it's cocked on closing instead). Third, because of this, it takes less effort to cycle a cartridge with an SMLE than it does with most other bolt-action rifles (the closing motion of working a bolt-action weapon makes use of stronger muscles in the user's arm and hand).
</li></ul></li><li> Motorcycle couriers and semaphore lamps were key to Paul van Riper's derailed victory in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002">2002 Millennium Challenge wargame<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Admittedly, the motorcycle couriers apparently moved at the speed of light (the wargame's rules were not designed for this), but the Germans had used normal-speed motorcycle couriers to similar effect in the Battle of the Bulge.
</li><li> Al Unser won the 1987 Indy 500 in a year-old backup car that had been on display at a Sheraton hotel in Pennsylvania until just 2 weeks prior to the race. Unser was hired by Penske to replace an injured driver, and the car was quickly shipped to Indianapolis to be restored to race condition. They were so rushed that they only had time to apply the correct sponsorship decals to one side of the car, and Unser had less than 72 hours to familiarize himself with it and correct any issues before qualifying.
</li><li> Ever heard of the A1 Tornado? It's an updated version of a 60-year-old design called the Peppercorn A1.<em><a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8428097.stm">Tornado rescued stranded passengers after modern rail services were brought to a halt by the snowy conditions in south-east England<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> in late December 2009.
<ul><li> While on that subject: What do you do when a sudden spike in aluminium demand requires an extra locomotive to haul bauxite? <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13592652">Summon forth the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">mighty Deltic!</a>
</li><li> This has actually become common since the privatisation of British Rail, with museums hiring out diesels to private operators to make some extra cash, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies">steam-powered charter trips all over the country</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Soviet Union kept using vacuum tubes in its bombers long after the development of transistors since vacuum tubes are resistant to EMPs and many kinds of electronic counter-measures (ECM).
<ul><li> The USSR was also not very good at manufacturing semiconductors, and the earliest, most easily manufactured transistor designs are less reliable than vacuum tubes, particularly when subjected to vibration. Vacuum tubes also have substantially different properties than transistors, including being much more easily scaled up to higher power levels and higher frequencies. (Vacuum tubes are still common in terrestrial broadcast systems because they can easily be built to handle much higher power levels than are practical for transistors.)
</li></ul></li><li> Electric guitar players have also stuck with vacuum tubes; even today, 90% of amplifiers aimed at professional guitarists use them, as their sound quality simply cannot be duplicated by transistorized equipment. As for the guitars themselves, the three most popular are the Fender Telecaster (1952), the Gibson Les Paul (1952), and the incomparably younger Fender Stratocaster (1954).
<ul><li> The Tele is actually an upgraded version of the Broadcaster of 1948.
</li></ul></li><li> During the initial stages of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles">Israeli War of Independence in '48</a>, the Israeli supply situation was so bad that they even used Napoleonic-era, muzzle-loading cannons.
<ul><li> In a sense of irony, the first fighter aircraft used by the Israeli Air Force were Messerschmidt Bf 109s, and their pilots used Luftwaffe flight uniforms (with the swastikas removed, of course).
</li><li> Similarly, mujahideen fighters desperate for a way to fight the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Afghan War used <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezail">Jezail muskets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, some of which were cobbled together from parts used by British Brown Bess rifles going back to the First Anglo-Afghan war, which started in 1838.
</li></ul></li><li> Blackburn Buccaneer a.k.a The Banana Jet. It was designed in 1954 and outlasted its all intended successors in both FAA and RAF use. It was finally withdrawn in 1994 because the airframes were too stressed to keep flying safely.
</li><li> An F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter was shot down by a Serbian anti-aircraft battery <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-10-26-serb-stealth_x.htm">using a Soviet missile from the early 1960s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The F-117 had come in on the exact same trajectory several times in a row, and the Serbs had set up a specialized type of radar pointed straight down its flight path, so the use of early 1960s SAMs isn't now standard doctrine for opposing F-117s — but it did work.
<ul><li> F-117 and B-2 were designed to be poorly visible in a limited radio band typically used by modern radars. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">1960s radars and guided missiles used lower frequencies.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Between the poverty, the isolation, and the insanity, it's no surprise that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> has a few examples.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, they used sea mines dating back to the Russo-Japanese War. (In fact, they're still using them.)
</li><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKoreansWithNodongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKoreansWithNodongs">North Korean military</a> carries equipment dating back to the 1970s or earlier. The forces deployed to defend the capital have more recent gear, but that's about it.
</li><li> Reportedly, some of their reservists don't even have firearms and carry bladed weapons. That's not likely to end well — and even if it somehow does (perhaps by sticking to built-up areas and ensuring they have enough grenades), it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">a different trope</a>.
</li><li> The Korean People's Air Force has a small number of relatively modern fighter jets, including the MiG-29. They also operate many older airplanes. Including around thirty MiG-15s, as in the fighter jet they flew in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a></em>, although their remaining MiG-15s are all trainers.
</li><li> Did we mention that they also have biplanes? Specifically, the Antonov An-2 Colt transport, the smaller Russian cousin to the equally universal DC-3. It's hard to pick up on radar, and so slow that modern fighters have trouble engaging it with guns, and it can take off and land from improvised air strips, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">making it an ideal commando or officer transport</a>. For the same reasons, around ten are also used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKoreansWithMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKoreansWithMarines">South Korean Air Force</a>. Outside of the two Koreas, even smaller European countries like Estonia, Moldova, and Macedonia also operate the An-2 as a paratrooper plane. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars">while fighting the Serbs in the early 1990s</a>, Croatians even used them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">improvised</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">bombers</a></em> to take out Serbian armoured vehicles and fortifications. While one or two were shot down, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">the plan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">worked</a></em>. In fact, it worked so well that none were shot down until Serbs specifically brought in a modified SAM battery, as <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SAMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SAMs">SA Ms</a> present could not target something so slow.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1807 the Ottomans loaded some giant cannons that had been collecting dust since the fall of Constantinople three and a half centuries earlier and used them to repel a British attack on the Dardanelles. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20468_the-6-most-mismatched-battles-ever-won-by-underdogs.html">It worked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. For added value, the Ottomans didn't have the "munition" used by these cannons anymore (they originally fired giant boulders) and just loaded them with debris, effectively creating makeshift grapeshot.
</li><li> The four <em>Iowa</em>-class battleships have been mothballed and recommissioned <em>twice</em>, being employed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>, the 1982 Beirut conflict, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GulfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GulfWar">Gulf War</a>, to devastating effect. And Congress wouldn't let the navy get rid of them completely, until the early years of the 21st century. All four are now gone, but are now <em>literal</em> museum pieces, as they have been made into floating museums (the <em>Iowa</em> in Los Angeles, the <em>New Jersey</em> in Camden, New Jersey, the <em>Missouri</em> in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the <em>Wisconsin</em> in Norfolk, Virginia), under orders of an Act of Congress that they be maintained in such a way that they could be returned to service, if need be. This is not as implausible as one might first think of 70-year-old warships, due to the simple fact that there is no modern ship, including aircraft carriers, that can put nearly as much explosive ordnance onto a contested beachhead within 20 miles of the ocean as an Iowa class with 9 16-inchers. There is very little doubt that the battleships day as a primary fleet force projector ended long ago with the rise of the aircraft carrier, but as for its use in naval gunfire support, the debate is still ongoing.
<ul><li> After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Battleship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Battleship">Battleship</a></em>, Slate ran an article positing whether or not it would be possible to return the <em>Iowa</em>-class battleships to active duty now that they're museum ships. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/05/21/battleship_movie_and_the_u_s_s_missouri_is_the_u_s_s_missouri_really_still_seaworthy_.html">It would actually be very easy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, assuming that enough crew, fuel, and ammunition for its main guns are on hand for that.

</li><li> Quite a bit of obsolete-but-still-useful equipment tends to be stockpiled just in case it's ever needed again. Of note is the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan AFB outside of Tucson, Arizona, essentially one of the largest airplane boneyards in the world. They periodically dip into this stockpile of stored airframes to sell them to other countries, scrap them, or use them for parts for still-flying airframes (worth noting that some American planes, such as the C-130 and the B-52, have been flying since the 1950s). It is notable that for many aircraft (like the listed B-52 as well as the A-10) this is actually their only source of spare parts as the aircraft are no longer in production and the plants are long closed. Some even get turned into remote-controlled drones for things like target practice.
</li><li> The Colt M1911 was a defiance of this trope that went on to become it:
<ul><li> During the Philippine-American war, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_M1892">the Colt M1892<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the standard pistol at the time proved ineffective against Moro tribesmen. The army switched back to the Single Action Army, an 1873 revolver in .45 Long Colt until Colt could design the M1911, which combined a (then-)modern magazine action and revolver-quality stopping power with the heavy .45 ACP round (at the cost of armor penetration, although body armor wasn't in large use at the time).
</li><li> During Operation Desert Storm, some US Marine Recon units switched back to their retired M1911A1s as a sidearm, since their standard-issue Beretta M9s tended to jam up when exposed to sand. They even made a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEU(SOC)_pistol">modernized version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Force Recon units.
<ul><li> The original M9 (rather than the improved M9A1 and M9A3 variants) is a failed attempt at creating a double-action/single-action semi-automatic pistol with modern safety features and chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum that is as reliable as a Beretta Model 1934 chambered for .380 ACP. An M1934 has only 39 parts, isn't made anymore, can be used in almost any climate, has an estimated service life of well over a century, and, if you're lucky, you might find one that's up for sale which costs less than an M1911. There's also the Beretta M1951, the direct ancestor of the M9, which is also in 9x19mm Parabellum, has been locally manufactured and functions perfectly in desert conditions, which led to its adoption and use by the Egyptian Army during <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheColdWar">The Cold War</a>, who even manufactured the M1951 themselves as the Helwan.
</li></ul></li><li> Delta Force still uses the M1911A1 today alongside Glock handguns in 9x19mm Parabellum.
</li></ul></li><li> Suggested but averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> during the American Revolution. The Battle of Bunker Hill ended with them being driven off when they ran out of ammunition. Franklin suggested that if they had used bows and arrows, they could have held out longer <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">fired off volleys more rapidly</a>.
<ul><li> It may be possible that this referred more to the fact that at the start of the Revolution, the colonists were desperately short of gunpowder. At one point, there were literally only a few dozen barrels left for the entire army, which would have been just enough for one pitched battle without artillery. The situation did improve later on when France became heavily involved in the war and started sending over regular supplies of the stuff.
</li><li> On the other hand, English officers had been proposing this on and off throughout the 18th century. Trained longbowmen couldn't be beaten for sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">volume of fire</a> until the introduction of breech-loading mechanisms and metallic cartridges; the catch is the "trained" part. It took many years of training to be a truly accomplished longbowman, whereas a simple musket could be mastered in a week by the simplest peasant. It was not actually superiority in combat that led to the firearm supplanting the bow and arrow, as the bow was capable of a significantly higher rate of fire, farther accurate range in skilled hands, and free of the problems of misfires that often plagued the muskets of the era (though they shared a weakness to wet weather, as a wet bowstring is about as useful as wet gunpowder is). What did the bow in was the fact that an army that used firearms could field about 10 times as many men as one that fielded bowmen due to the contrast in training time.
<ul><li> There is a very old saying: "To train an archer; start with his grandfather".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The first operational SR-71 was retired to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in the '70s, only to be put back into service for 20 years and permanently retired in 1990. But perhaps the retirement was premature since the plane broke an air speed record <em>on the way to the museum</em>.
<ul><li> The SR-71 was considered obsolete due to the existence of spy satellites. However, its predecessor, the U-2, is still used today — primarily because it can relay information to other aircraft, which the SR-71 couldn't do due to the shockwaves caused from flying at speeds exceeding Mach 3. And this is an aircraft model that was introduced to the USAF in <em>1957</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> When British firefighters went on strike in 2002, the Army was called upon to provide cover. They made extensive use of "Green Goddess" fire engines, built in the 50s and mothballed in the late 60s. The law has now been changed so in a future strike, the Army would have access to the fire brigade's equipment, and the Green Goddesses have been sold to developing countries.
</li><li> The Italian Air Force used the F-104 until 2004 in spite not only of the extreme age of the design (the airplane was first flown in 1954, with the Italian F-104S version being manufactured between 1964 and 1979) but of its tendency to crash. It helped it was actually <em>faster</em> than the more modern F-16 that had been considered to replace it in the 1980s...<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10l5p9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10l5p9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10l5p9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though of course, the F-104 was designed as a dedicated Interceptor, that is, a very fast jet designed primarily to knock down bombers, while the F-16 was intended as a more robust <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a></span>
<ul><li> Also the old Carcano (dating back to 1891, with newest ones made in 1945) and Garand rifles are still kept in the arsenals to be used by the reserve in case of war.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Homeland War, some Croatian units used M4 Sherman tanks and US WWII M36 Jackson tank destroyers. They proved effective in infantry support. The M4 Sherman remains in service (as of 2019, only as presidential honor guard) in certain parts of South America.
</li><li> The London Transport Routemaster double-decker bus. It has outlasted all its planned replacements and was phased out only because even the youngest specimens were over 40 years old and worn from daily use. Even now, several examples remain in service on "heritage" routes in London and many more are in daily use as wedding cars, tourist buses, and the like. Also, it caused quite the uproar when the buses were replaced with supposedly more modern "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_buses_in_London">bendy buses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"; one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a>'s main campaign promises was to bring back the Routemaster, and wouldn't you know it—<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Routemaster">he did<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The city of Ottawa, Canada is about to <em>start</em> using a double-decker design, as the concept (doubling the passenger space without taking up more roadway, increasing the turn radius, or dealing with all the headaches articulated bus designs gave the city's transit service) is actually a really good one.
<ul><li> And, as with London, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.autos.ca/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=fvs07aspafma2qupb8docpbvj1&amp;topic=85750.msg934364#msg934364">bendy buses sometimes prove less than satisfactory<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When the railways on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, had to be electrified, it was discovered that the tunnels and bridges were too low for conventional electric trains. Fortunately, it just happened that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground">The London Underground</a> was disposing of some of its older trains, and ever since then they've used retired Tube trains. The ones currently in service were built in 1938.
<ul><li> This occurred in the '60s (it's long been quite difficult and expensive to ship stuff out there) to replace steam trains dating back to the Victorian era.
</li><li> One of those electric trains <a class="urllink" href="https://iwradio.co.uk/2016/03/17/isle-of-wight-steam-train-comes-to-the-rescue/">broke down and was rescued<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by a steam locomotive from the nearby Isle of Wight Steam Railway...which was actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">13 years newer.</a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> Several heritage railways in the UK provide a useful public transport service using antique equipment — often because the heritage railway uses a line that was closed down with no decent transport alternative in the area.
<ul><li> Similarly, in the US, the Strasburg Railroad (the oldest in the Western Hemisphere still in operation under its original charter) operates regular freight service in addition to its heritage passenger trains - if not with the same steam engines then with diesels that are sometimes older than the steam engines they would have replaced were when built.
</li></ul></li><li> On a similar note, about half of the trains on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATCO_Speedline">PATCO Speedline<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a> are original-issue, built in 1968. The functional elements (the motors and brakes) have been refurbished or replaced several times since then, of course, but some interiors are original. This is due to change starting in 2015, as PATCO is refurbishing the interiors up to a modern standard and installing some modern equipment (including automated station announcements, a better speaker system, and spots for wheelchairs)—but that said, the cars themselves remain original.
</li><li> On single-level overnight trains, due to a lack of replacements, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amtrak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amtrak">Amtrak</a> uses dining cars built between 1948 and 1956. The first-class lounge cars on the <em>Coast Starlight</em> are from the same era, as is the <em>entire</em> fleet of baggage cars. Most of these are in the process of being replaced, due to the lack of replacement parts.
</li><li> Up north in Canada, the <em>Canadian</em> uses much of the same equipment the train was first equipped with. In 1955. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11purg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11purg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11purg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <em>Canadian</em> fleet *has* been significantly rebuilt twice over, but the cars are still the originals.</span> Unlike with Amtrak, there are no plans to retire this equipment.
</li><li> In a crossover between the above two, in 2012 much of New Jersey's commuter car fleet was flooded out. To compensate for the equipment shortage, Amtrak ran some extra services at Thanksgiving...and made up for <em>that</em> equipment shortfall by borrowing some cars from VIA Rail Canada...cars which it sold VIA Rail in the early 1990s while upgrading its fleet.
</li><li> Some vehicle museums keep <em>all</em> their display vehicle in working order.
</li><li> Some navies keep old 7.62mm chambered rifles on board in addition to standard 5.56mm for resupply at sea evolutions. The reason? The 5.56mm blank cartridges are unable to propel the line far enough to reach the other ship.
</li><li> The Finnish Army Field Kitchen, m/29 <em>Soppatykki</em> (Soup Cannon). Originally designed in 1929 for horse-drawn troops and be used with firewood, it is <em>still</em> in production, adapted to be towed by lorries and smaller motor vehicles. The redesign, m/85, is merely an incorporation and documentation of all changes and improvements (tail lights, improved suspension, rubber tyres, brakes, safety reflectors, AC connection, optional electric heater, etc) on the original. Several of the WWII veteran field kitchens are still in use, and they are popular also in civilian life, e.g. festivals, concerts, scout camps, and outdoors events.
<ul><li> Many Boy Scouts in Finland learn how to operate it as children, so when they reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a> age they already know how to operate it.
</li></ul></li><li> The example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries">The Railway Series</a></em> is very closely based on an incident on the Talyllyn railway, in which the railway's newer locomotives were out of commission, and <em>Dolgoch</em>, one of the two original engines from when the line was opened, had to haul the train (and, on one journey, did indeed limp back with a broken spring). Another, similar, incident happened a few years earlier (before the line was preserved) when <em>Dolgoch</em> was the only usable engine; it derailed and the even older <em>Talyllyn</em> had to be steamed to recover it. L.T.C. Rolt commented that given the condition <em>Talyllyn</em> was in at the time, it must have been a brave man who dared to drive it.
<ul><li> The second example, written as "Super Rescue", was similarly based on a real-life incident that took place at Waterloo Station in 1967.
</li></ul></li><li> During the national conflicts in the last years of USSR, a number of armored vehicles were stolen from museums and monuments, especially in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Few had working or repairable engines, let alone weapons, but even a towed tank hull is good for blocking a (mountain) road.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_Hungary#Monday.2C_October_23.2C_2006">In October 2006 protesters in Budapest, Hungary,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> managed to start a T-34-85 tank. The tank was a part of the memorial to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956">revolution of 1956<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which protesters were celebrating, conveniently located near the parliament building. They successfully used the tank against riot police, but it quickly ran out of fuel.
</li><li> The British Railways Class 55 "Deltic" diesel locomotive was retired in the early 1980s when it was replaced by the HST 125 on express passenger services. A few of the surviving Deltics have returned to revenue service, pulling heavy freight trains on special contracts. The Deltics have the advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">a 3300-horsepower output and a top speed of 100 miles per hour</a>, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">a fair match for more modern diesels</a>.
</li><li> The Union Pacific Railroad retired all (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamNeverDies">but one</a>) of its steam engines, though now it occasionally orders Challenger 3985, the largest operating steam locomotive in the world, to pull revenue-earning trains.
<ul><li> The UP announced it will return Big Boy 4014 to operating condition, meaning the world's largest steam locomotive will run again. And they did — operational Big Boy 4014 participated in the 150th anniversary of the "last spike" in May 2019.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to the above-mentioned Enfields, some strapped-for-resources Afghan Militia used black powder Jezail muskets, most of which were created during the last major war against an invading superpower, the Anglo-Afghan war.
</li><li> The ferry service on Lake Tanganyika is provided by the MV <em>Liemba</em>, a beautiful ship whose classical lines suggest another era, mainly because that's what it was from; the <em>Liemba</em> started life as the SMS <em>Graf von Goetzen</em>, a German gunboat launched in Papenburg and sent by the <em>Kaiserliche Marine</em> to control Lake Tanganyika. She was scuttled by her master in 1916, as the British closed the net around German Africa, and was raised by the British colonial authorities in 1927 to serve as a ferry. She still sails.
<ul><li> This isn't unusual for ships operating on freshwater lakes and rivers; without seawater and all the associated corrosion issues to deal with, a steel hull can last for decades before metal fatigue sets in.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Railway">Eritrean railway<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was built by Italian colonial authorities in the late 19th - early 20th century and fell into disrepair in the ensuing civil wars. After the country gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, the population eventually managed to rebuild it — a commendable feat taking into account the number and complexity of artificial structures involved as it climbs from sea level to a mountain plateau more than 2000 meters above it. Not having the resources to purchase and maintain modern running stock, they succeeded in restoring most of the surviving old units to working conditions. I.e. they are currently using <em>steam locomotives</em>, some of which are <em>more than 100 years old.</em>
</li><li> New computers often lack the Stereo Mix function or equivalent program that lets the sound card record exactly what comes out of the speakers. Some suspect that this is the RIAA's doing (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">Digital Piracy Is Evil</a>). Of course, older computers, many of which still run Vista or even the recently abandoned XP can still record sound just fine.
</li><li> In China, police <em>and</em> the armed forces use <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-old-weapon-technologies-with-new-purpose/">crossbows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as of the recent terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and the riots in 2009. The reasoning behind this is that while a bullet can set off a shock-sensitive explosive, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow#Modern_military_and_paramilitary_use">a crossbow can simply kill the suicide bomber while not detonating the bomb.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In 1962 the <em>Margaret Rose</em>, a ship that wrecked off Provincetown, was trapped near the beach and couldn't be reached by amphibious vehicle or boat due to high seas. A helicopter was also called in but was unable to hover over the ship due to cross-winds. The only feasible way to rescue the crew was determined to be by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeches_buoy">Breeches Buoy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a 19th-century method of rescue that used a small brass cannon to fire a line to a disabled vessel, allowing the rescuers to send out a small "car" (think of a cross between a zipline harness and a life preserver) to shuttle people to shore. It was a method largely abandoned by the modern Coast Guard, and in fact only a week earlier the local base had considered retiring the equipment permanently.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, the US military realized it had too quickly demobilized and dismantled the old fashioned equipment left over from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that'd be suitable in Korea, such as P-51 Mustang fighters and M-4 Sherman tanks. At least some of the equipment shipped over to Korea were literally taken hastily from war memorials. Mind you, the US Air Force was still operating Mustangs (by now re-designated as F-51s), albeit more advanced versions than the WWII models.
</li><li> When the concept of the Gatling Gun was being evaluated in mid-20th century for US Air Force, an actual Civil War piece was taken from a museum and hooked to an electric motor. The gun supposedly worked fine, despite being nearly a century old.
</li><li> In 2013 NASA engineers took a specimen of the beastly huge F-1 rocket engine, originally built for <em>Apollo 11</em> but not flown, from the Smithsonian for testing. There are no plans to fly the old engine but it will help the development of an upgraded version for use on the Space Launch System.
<ul><li> It was actually <em>very</em> close to being a literal example of this trope. NASA had planned on making direct copies of the F-1 to use on heavier payloads, but they ran into a fatal problem: one of the key qualities of the F-1's that made them such great engines is that each one had minor tweaks and adjustments made by their engineers to suit the missions they were intended for. NASA had the original plans for the engine, but the engineers who had worked on them never officially documented their personal changes, and had since forgotten the changes or had already passed away, meaning that the knowledge to fine-tune the engines to peak performance was lost.
</li></ul></li><li> The civil war that broke out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ukraine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> in 2014 has seen both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UkrainiansWithDepletedUranium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UkrainiansWithDepletedUranium">Ukrainian military</a> and the separatist side using <em>really</em> old guns and even <em>tanks</em> that date back to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ08aPtFXDA">World War I and World War II.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Quite understandable for both: the Ukrainian army lost a lot of materiel when Russia annexed Crimea and had already been badly underfunded for years even before the conflict, and the separatists, despite receiving Russian support, are having to make do with whatever equipment they're able to scrounge up and salvage for the majority of their combat operations.
<ul><li> In mid-2014, separatists in Donetsk region, Ukraine, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/6/pro-russian-separatists-take-wwii-era-tank/">took an IS-3 tank<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12ej0c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12ej0c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12ej0c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Heavy tank manufactured in USSR in 1945-46.

Its engine was in usable condition, and more importantly, its gun was compatible with shells still used by the Ukrainian army. However, the Ukrainian army recaptured the tank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">after just a few weeks</a> and by July 2014, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">it was back on display as a museum piece.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In 2015, an accident knocked out the electric power supply on the Dutch Railways line between Hoorn and Enkhuizen, leaving an electric train stranded a few miles outside Hoorn. Fortunately there's a heritage railway at Hoorn, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePB1C1MKkMU">they were happy to lend their antique locomotives to assist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Also in 2015, a train derailed in Kent after hitting cows on the line. The damaged train was recovered by 1001, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.preservedthumpers.com/articles-thumper-rescue.html">a preserved diesel unit from the 1950s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In 2016, the United States has brought back the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Rockwell_OV-10_Bronco">OV-10 Bronco<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfBCr7_6XaI">for use in fighting ISIS.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This plane was first deployed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> in the 1960s. The last time it saw military action was in 1991 during the first Gulf War. That's a 25 year retirement period. But as it turns out, when fighting a lightly armed enemy that relies primarily on mobility and small arms, propeller-driven planes work just fine at smoking them.
</li><li> Sweden has rebuilt a Cold War-era <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thelocal.se/20161120/sweden-brings-cold-war-missile-defence-system-out-of-museums">coastal missile defense system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from pieces that were kept in museums.
</li><li> In 1796, a counter-revolutionary mob was marching on the Paris Directory (the seat of government); a quick-thinking lieutenant of artillery, noticing the antique cannon kept on the front doorstep as an ornament, managed to obtain a single charge of "Grapeshot" (a tin can filled with iron balls the size of ball bearings) and fired it at the approaching mob, killing dozens and dispersing the rest; he was promoted to General and given a medal for saving the French revolution with a "Whiff Of Grapeshot"; his name was... Napoleon Bonaparte!
</li><li> In the Netherlands some of the old steam pumps that were used to regulate the water level of the farmlands or polders are still kept functional in their capacity as monuments or museums. It happens from time to time that the water levels become dis-regulated enough that the modern system of electrical pumps simply does not have the capacity to deal with in, in which cases the old steam pumps can be brought back online to help.
<ul><li> So far no reports are known about any of the even older windmills made for the job being brought back into action in the modern day.
</li><li> When the electric pumps supplying the Kennet and Avon Canal failed in 2009, the authorities contacted the museum keeping the original steam pumping station, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2e86401b6adefb23e8b81baa224318f2">who happily fired up the nearly 200-year-old engine.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> When the Royal Australian Army finally decided to create a sniper school in the 70s, they were initially equipped with WW1-era SMLE No. 1 Mk III* rifles.
</li><li> An interesting case of the museum piece <em>never stopping in the first place,</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkVVwsic9g">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> hit-and-miss engine has supposedly been running since the 1930's running on the very oil it is pumping out of the ground.
</li><li> On 29 October 1880, in squally winds, a schooner, Luna, struck Redcar pier on the north-east coast of England and broke in half. The local lifeboat crew had two lifeboats at the time, Emma and Burton-on-Trent, but were both out of action having sustained damage while rescuing crew members from two other vessels in distress. Fortunately for the crew of the Luna, there was a third lifeboat available, the then seventy-eight-year-old Zetland which had been officially retired (and narrowly avoided being broken up)sixteen years earlier. She was launched and successfully saved the Luna's seven sailors. It was the last launch of the old boat and she became a literal museum piece thirty-seven years later, holding the title of being the world's oldest lifeboat.
</li><li> Perhaps the ultimate naval example is the Russian Federation's salvage tender <a class="urllink" href="https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-oldest-active-navy-ship-is-a-century-old-russian-su-1681527424">Kommuna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which entered service with the Russian Imperial Navy in <em>1915</em> as a submarine tender.
</li><li> On July 11, 2009, a robber walked into a convenience store in Richmond, Virginia, and opened fire on the clerk. A shootout ensued when a customer in the store pulled out his gun and returned fire. Said gun was <a class="urllink" href="http://singleactions.proboards.com/thread/1004/updated-legit-ccw-shooting-sa?page=2">an 1875 Remington .45 Colt single-action revolver with a 7.5" barrel.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> While it was a replica of current manufacture, the firearm's design itself was still over 130 years old at the time of the incident. The bad guy, who was also armed with a revolver (albeit one of double-action modern design) was successfully stopped with no innocent casualties.
</li><li> A literal example happened during the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_London_Bridge_stabbing">2019 London Bridge attacks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. When a knife-wielding terrorist attacked the historic building of Fishmongers Hall, a chef working at the building reacted by grabbing a narwhal tusk on display and wielding it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeapon">weapon</a> to drive them out.
</li><li> If specialized skill sets rate as "technology", then the ancient practice of falconry - a hunting tradition at least as old as human civilization - has found a whole new 21st-century application. Aside from its occasional use in pest control around airports and urban areas, trained eagles are now proving viable as a defense against consumer-grade drones: snatching intruding quad drones out of the air around sporting events, airports, and prisons more safely and reliably than net-launchers or interceptor-drones, and retrieving smugglers' contraband-loaded drones intact as evidence.
</li><li> Modern flatscreen televisions have a slight bit of lag that wasn't present in old CRTs. For most purposes, this is completely ignorable, but high-end tournament play in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em> requires lightning-quick reaction times that simply aren't possible with that lag, leading to several tournaments having to dig up old bulky units just for this game. Despite the game's enduring popularity, the increasing difficulty of acquiring working CRT televisions was one of the factors leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FightingGameCommunity">EVO</a> finally retiring <em>Melee</em> in 2019.

<ul><li> Similar to the point brought up regarding <em>The Salvation War</em>, there is a story that the US keeps, in case modern trains are rendered useless, a federal strategic reserve of steam locomotives.
<ul><li> Same thing in Britain. When the conspiracy theorists are asked to suggest exactly where a lot of large and hard-to-hide steam locos are being stored in a country as small as Britain, and indeed where they think the necessary supporting logistics of coal and water are going come from on a rail system switched over to electric and diesel 50 years ago in a country that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">has closed all its coalmines</a>, they can get very incoherent.
