Though Glitterhoof's "Horse" trait is supposed to both make him/her infertile and prevent him/her from being granted titles, players quickly discovered a variety of <a class="urllink" href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-a-horse-conquered-the-ancient-world-1757913762">exploits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to switch their dynasty to Horse culture (along with a whole lot of other nonsensical-in-context oddities, such as Glitterhoof plotting a murder or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">being made a concubine</a>, that usually end up in the forum's Strange Screenshots thread). Upon realizing how funny the players thought the whole thing was, Paradox first announced they would not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">patch the bugs around Glitterhoof</a>, then in <em>Reaper's Due</em> they added an additional horse and an event chain where you could make either of them immortal (which may lead to you being attacked by an immortal stallion, named Incitatus after Caligula's actual horse). <em>Jade Dragon</em> added cat and bear NPCs with whom you can do many of the same things. And then, when the <em>Holy Fury</em> DLC was introduced, it included the option to split each individual region into its own nation, modify religions, cultures, etc., including the option to shuffle cultures but make them Animal-Only.
</li><li> <em>Holy Fury</em>'s new duel system allowed characters to escape an incoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> by dropping an artifact from their inventory and making a run for it while the opponent got the artifact.

Paradox quickly took note, but instead of fixing it added a unique event text if your opponent decided to strip naked to escape you.

In the first game, adopting a Democracy government reduces the AI's willingness to use nuclear weapons on you. Gandhi, as a famous peacekeeper, already had his willingness set to the lowest value - so lowering it caused an underflow error where it came back out the top again as <strong>instant nuclear fury</strong>. The hilarity of it is probably why Gandhi has been the historical figure for India in every game of the series, and in later games his AI was directly programmed to be unwilling to go to war, but go for the nuke button instantly if he did.

<ul><li> The bug catching net in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> was not supposed to be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">reflect Aghanim's shots</a> but its ability to do so led to a whole string of future ascensions in later games in the series, such as being able to distract Ganon with the fishing rod in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>.
</li><li> The 3DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> contains many of the bugs from the original N64 release, such as the ability to enter certain areas that should be locked off to you. The original plan was to fix all these bugs, but many of the developers argued that the bugs were a part of how the game played and as such should be left in. In the end, any glitch that wasn't actively harmful (such as the Deku Nut upgrade being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>) was left in as a deliberate feature.
</li><li> Being able to avoid the self-damage from the Blast Mask (which creates an explosion centered on your face) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockingStopsAllDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockingStopsAllDamage">by putting your shield up</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> <em>probably</em> wasn't intentional, but it was kept in the remake because it was so iconic.
</li><li> In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, it was possible to get Green Chu Jelly if a Blue and Yellow Chu combined. Green Chu Jelly was (supposed to be) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> leftover from earlier builds where the game still had a magic meter, but the developers forgot the possibility of a Blue and Yellow Chu combining and providing the item, which has no text when obtained and no effect when drunk. This was fixed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a> version (Blue and Yellow Chus combine to make a Purple Chu instead), but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> HD edition the glitch was embraced instead: Green Chus are encounterable and the jelly's flavor text points "It does not look all that tasty and it doesn't look like it will do much".
</li><li> <em>Twilight Princess</em> also sees the ascension of Bomb Arrows, which was a glitch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em> that was even brought over to the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Switch</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>: Characters that can use multiple different weapons can be glitched into using weapons belonging to other characters entirely, essentially making them behave like the character that their swapped weapon belongs to. While the glitch itself was patched after a few updates, in some of the missions in the Master Quest Map, Twilight Map and Termina Map, you can run into characters who use a different character's weapon and moveset.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenotopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenotopia">Phoenotopia</a></em>, if you mash the attack button during a charged swing, you can do up to three double-damage swings in a row. This was initially an endless amount, but when the creator decided to leave it in (as a secret technique), he capped it at three swings for balancing reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lara Croft's iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel">Boobs of Steel</a> came about from a programmer accidentally slipping a decimal point and the design team deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> has a assumed-to-be glitch during the Tomb of Qualopec level where the player could aim their pistols at one of two mummies positioned by Qualopec's throne (which are encountered as enemies late in the game) and shoot it, which would cause it to roar and fall over. The remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderAnniversary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderAnniversary">Tomb Raider: Anniversary</a></em> takes this scenario and incorporates it into a cutscene: while Lara is examining the throne, the same mummy lounges at her before dying, causing a startled Lara to quickly aim her pistols at it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series' combat system was born from a glitch that was removed during the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaWarlords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaWarlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a></em> where enemies could be launched into the air and juggled with further attacks. It got cut for being out of character for the game, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> decided that the glitch was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">too cool</a> to not use somewhere else.
</li><li> In the original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening">Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening</a></em>, the player can unlock a "Super Dante" costume, which allows them to be in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Devil Trigger form</a> as long as they want. However, while other techniques that rely on the Devil Trigger gauge (DT Explosions, Quicksilver and Doppelganger styles) were still supposed to use up its power with this costume, a glitch gave them infinite use as well. For the <em>Special Edition</em>, while the glitches around Super Dante were fixed, a Super version of the "Legendary Dark Knight" costume was also added which kept the glitch's behavior, as an unlockable for beating the game on the hardest difficulty level.
</li><li> Enemy hiking has been around since the original game but crafty players discovered that hopping off enemies resets Dante's air state, allow him to repeat actions in the air that can only be done once per jump. In the first game, this permitted the idea of "shotgun hiking", which involved shooting an enemy with a shotgun then jumping off of them and doing it again. By <em>DMC3</em>, this evolved into a full-fledged advanced strategy (in the original game it was a bit of a gimmick technique) with the addition of the Style system as Style moves and sword attacks could be repeated in the air endlessly as long as you kept bouncing off the foe (here it gained the moniker "jump cancels"). This got some genuine acknowledgement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">DmC: Devil May Cry</a></em> when some of the load screen combo samples show combos involving jump-canceled attacks. The original series also got around to acknowledging this when the Special Edition version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> came out and Capcom released an official video of them demonstrating the technique on their YouTube channel (which, unfortunately, has since been removed).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet">Freedom Planet</a></em>, an exploit commonly used by Lilac speedrunners is the jump uppercut, where you jump and press up+attack within two frames of each other. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet2">the sequel</a>, Lilac's reveal trailer shows her using a modified version where the uppercut now works in midair.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robocraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robocraft">Robocraft</a></em>, a glitch means that players can occasionally ghost through the bottom of the build hangar, leaving them unable to get back in. Instead of patching it, the devs added a code to the back of the ship, giving a special cosmetic item to anyone who happens to pull off the glitch. What's more, they're considering adding an airlock to the hangar so you can get back in after glitching your way out.
</li><li> In the NES game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em>, clever players could quickly unstick and restick to a wall to climb it, even if it had no ladder. The sequels added the wall climbing skill as a default ability and adapted the game levels around it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModnationRacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModnationRacers">Modnation Racers</a></em>, there was a glitch that allowed you to 3D rotate objects in track editor. This is one of the few glitches that was never patched due to the creators really enjoying the creations that were made by this glitch. It even became an available feature on the PS Vita port.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout">Wipeout</a> Pure</em> is an interesting case where the glitch got removed but acknowledged in-universe, rather than kept for later games. The Triakis ship had a bug in its programming that made it decelerate much slower than other craft in spite of its weight, allowing it to navigate corners much quicker than normal. In the next game, <em>Wipeout Pulse</em>, it handles corners appropriately and it is explained that Triakis actually won the league in <em>Pure</em>, but due to their "reverse-inertia deceleration" technology they were disqualified.
</li><li> In the North American release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em>, Penta Penguin, a secret extra character unlocked only by cheat code, was partially unfinished. Because of this he encounters various glitches such as being given Uka Uka affiliation in the HUD but having Aku Aku as his protective mask in the game itself and having unfinished placeholder voice lines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatJoy">("Penguin yay one/two." when boosting for instance)</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Fighting Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> parented many of the glitches that also ended up redefining a whole genre of video games:
<ul><li> Cancelling: Inputting a second command quickly before the character has finished performing the first one can lead to the second move occurring instantly, bypassing the recovery animation of the first. This technique is now the cornerstone of many fighting games, where it is possible to cancel attacks, throws, jumps and dashes into one another, to say nothing of regular combos.
</li><li> Guile's "handcuffs glitch," where an opposing character would get stuck to him until he used the Invisible Throw to "unlock" them, inspired a special attack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie">Street Fighter: The Movie</a></em> involving actual handcuffs.
</li><li> Many combo-oriented games feature a variation of "Super Cancel" which can cancel any move into any other at the cost of the special gauge.
</li><li> Cross-ups: In games where blocking is achieved by holding "back", a cross-up is a situation where it is difficult to judge the correct direction to block your opponent's attack, such as when attacking while jumping right over the character. Needless to say that initially this was just a design oversight, but later it was polished and promoted to another aspect of out-thinking your opponent.
</li><li> Ryu's additional moves and supers in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs">Vs.</a></em> games (changing movesets to those of Ken or Akuma/Evil Ryu, invisible/explosive/multi-hadoken) are inspired by glitches or modifications created for a pirated edition of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>'s ROM board, dubbed the "Rainbow Edition." There, characters could transform into other characters by hitting the start button, and fireballs had variable speed and could have their flight paths be manually controlled or rendered invisible by player input.
</li><li> Most of Ryu and co.'s new moves in the <em>Turbo: Hyper Fighting</em> revision of <em>SF2</em> were also inspired by those hacks. It also featured a faster game speed.
</li><li> In the "Rainbow Edition" bootleg board, it was possible for Guile to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">cover the screen in Sonic Booms that zigzag up and down</a> due to the removal of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a> restrictions. Fast forward to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em>, where Charlie's "Sonic Break" super move had the exact same behavior as the hacked Sonic Boom trick.
</li><li> The "invisible Dhalsim" glitch (where occasionally, after doing a Yoga Fire move, the character's sprite would become invisible, unable to take or receive damage) was later incorporated into Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport.
</li><li> Cody's "Final Destruction" super move from <em>Alpha 3</em>. The move itself looks rather weird (if it connects, he will jab his opponent twice, turn away from and then back towards the enemy, and jab them twice again, doing this about four times before ending with a powerful string of attacks). However, it's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to a glitch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> where canceling out of a regular combo before it finishes by turning away from your target would let him destroy his opponents with ease. If used in X-ISM, this move changes all his attacks into his <em>Final Fight</em> attack strings instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Roll canceling<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ixs8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ixs8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ixs8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Inputting a roll quickly followed by a special move gives the special move invincibility for whatever the duration of roll would have been.</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2</a></em> has become an accepted, if not vital part of high-level play. Capcom acknowledged the behavior was a glitch while the game was still in arcades but did not code it out of the Dreamcast or PlayStation 2 releases. However, the "EO" builds developed for the GameCube and Xbox do not have roll cancels.
</li><li> A couple of bugs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> made their way into canon. One of them is Leona's respect for Chang (she salutes him starting with <em>KOF '98</em>; it cued some nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> back in the day). Another one is Kim's midair super in <em>KOF '94</em>; it was definitely a bug that affected other characters with midair command moves in <em>KOF '94</em> and <em>KOF '95</em>, but Kim's ability to do the Ho-o-kyaku in midair has been an intentional ability in many later games. There's also Heidern in <em>KOF 14</em>, where whiffing his Moon Slasher increases the damage of his next Storm Bringer, but nowhere near the levels of the glitch from <em>KOF '94</em> where it can easily OHKO.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>:
<ul><li> Baraka's "whirling dervish" move was originally the result of a glitch, but the developers liked it so much that it was eventually added to his repertoire.
</li><li> There was a glitch where Johnny Cage's uppercut fatality would decapitate the opponent twice. Developers took this a step further in <em>II</em>, giving him his hidden <em>triple</em> decapitation fatality. It even got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> in <em>11</em>, where his Deadly Uppercut is revisited so that the head doesn't come off, causing Johnny's camera crew to call for more takes until Cage pulls off the fatality (with three onscreen takes happening, in an allusion to II).
</li><li> Noob Saibot was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> of the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4">Mortal Kombat 4</a></em>, but made unlockable (although he lacked fatalities) in the console versions, and had a couple of rather glitchy alternate costumes.
</li><li> The legendary "Ermac" glitch, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">never happened</a>, though it became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a> in later games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em> has a particularly infamous infinite combo for player character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Zero</a> known as "Lightning Loops", which involves using Sougenmu then repeatedly jumping and doing downwards Raikousen. It looked very stylish and was a very powerful combo, though it was hard to do, and Capcom tried removing it by changing the way Raikousen handles corners when <em>Ultimate</em> rolled around. Enterprising players found that it was still possible, just a little harder to do now. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone">Project X Zone 2</a></em> then included the Lightning loops as part of X and Zero's super move. In <em>Infinite</em>, Zero retains the ability to do Lightning Loops, though they work a bit differently and are not nearly as devastating as they were in <em>3</em>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    First-Person Shooter </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI">Quake</a></em> had strafe-jumping, which was a bug at the time, but became so popular that it was later the trademark of its multiplayer component. An uproar went through the community as the mechanic was removed in one patch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena">Quake III: Arena</a></em>, so a new patch featured it as... well... a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">feature</a>, which was part of its success, along with a lot of other stuff. <em>Quake Live</em> even has a tutorial with many courses which rely on this.
<ul><li> Taken to a ridiculous extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warsow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warsow">Warsow</a></em>, wherein the game engine was built from the ground up to accommodate movement tricks that started as glitches in <em>Quake</em>.
</li><li> There's also the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">Rocket Jump</a>". Point the rocket launcher straight down, jump, and fire immediately after the start. The player will take an assload of damage, but will also be flung much farther than otherwise possible by jumping. When exactly this ascended is unclear, as the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> had a secret exit that was designed to only be accessible by launching yourself sideways off a wall with a rocket (other ways have since been found), and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a>, there's a secret spot which can only be reached by rocket jumping. In the latter, when you land, the text, "You crazy rocket jumpers!", appears.
<ul><li> One of the single player maps in <em>Quake</em> had a secret area accessed by a teleporter hanging from the wall. In order to reach the teleporter, you had to fire a grenade into a small hole in the ground beneath it, and jump over it just as it explodes. So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdSoftware">id</a> <em>did</em> have some knowledge of this technique in mind when designing the game.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> <em>Quake II: The Reckoning</em> mocked it in one of their levels. In it, you would see an Invulnerability which vanished after a certain distance. A message would show up later saying "No prize for you, rocketman." The expansion is also infamous for having significantly increased the Rocket Jump damage and distance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> actually had grenade jumping similar to "modern" rocket jumping, about the same time as <em>Doom</em>. It became an ascended glitch, too, with secret areas requiring it. In lower-gravity stages, you could even use the flamethrower as a makeshift jetpack. Although you could use the <em>recoil</em> from the rocket launcher to propel yourself, trying to use a point-blank blast to launch you upward would instead kill you instantly unless you had overcharged shields or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp">Invincibility Power-Up</a>. The recoil physics were nerfed in the second game's engine, precluding the "jetpack flamethrower".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>'s Soldier was designed with rocket jumping in mind, and can acquire boots that, in exchange for losing a shotgun, improve his rocket jumping ability. The "Gunboats" reduce damage taken from rocket jumps, and the "Mantreads" turn rocket jumps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">into an attack</a>. Now there are also weapons for both Soldier <em>and</em> Demoman solely designed for rocket jumping: They do no damage to anyone, but still allow rocket/sticky jumping.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad">Rise of the Triad</a></em> had rocket jumping back in 1994. The "Firebomb" missile launcher, when fired at the floor, would bounce the player backwards and upwards. This was actually necessary to complete the game's final level.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the update that added "King of the Hill" to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, when the round went into Overtime, the announcer would <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxVpuMBywwE">repeat her proclamation of "Overtime!" over and over<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> every time the point's status changed <em>at all</em>, including whenever a player stepped on or off of it. This one was so popular that <a class="urllink" href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/2738/">when Valve fixed it in the next update a day later, they added a server option that allowed admins to keep the buggy speech if they so desire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Further, an October 13th, 2011 patch added a server option to re-enable a popular bug, "Taunt Switching", wherein players could press the inputs for taunting and switching weapons at the same time to have the first weapon's taunt animation play while holding the second weapon - for example, a Spy could pretend to fence with a revolver rather than his butterfly knife, a Heavy could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling">twirl</a> his gigantic minigun around his trigger finger, or a Demoman could take a drink from his grenade launcher.
</li><li> The Sniper Vs. Spy update canonized the disguise kit+crouch+look up "Spycrab" pose (in which the spy's model stretches beyond his animation skeleton) by having approximately 1 out of 10 taunts with the disguise kit use an alternate animation with the spy dropping into a crouch and making claw motions with his hands.
</li><li> The Spy class itself was inspired by a bug in the original <em>Team Fortress</em>, where players would sometimes see other players with the wrong team's color.
</li><li> Before the Uber Update, there was an exploit for Demoman to allow him to turn sharply with the Chargin' Targe; this exploit was later turned into an item called "Ali Baba's Wee Booties". The only downside is that you don't have a Grenade Launcher.
</li><li> The Demoman's melee taunt, originally, could have him drink from anything <em>but</em> a bottle of scrumpy; i-ghost, a contributor to <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, removed most of these taunts as part of a cleanup project, except when drinking from the Frying Pan, as it was deemed 'too funny' to remove.
</li></ul></li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a>: Episode One</em>, Alyx asks her robotic companion Dog "You <em>did</em> do the math, right?", right before being flung across a bottomless pit into the Citadel. Dog originally wasn't supposed to do anything, but during a run-through of the scene before the animations were finished, Dog inserted his head-shaking idle animation <em>right after that line</em>, and the playtesters loved it so much it was worked into the actual script.
<ul><li> <em>Episode Two</em> has a bug with a dumpster in which a fast headcrab zombie is hiding. If the player tosses a grenade in a dumpster, the grenade will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeHotPotato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeHotPotato">be tossed back out</a>. According to the commentary, this happened by chance in playtesting (the player is subtly warned of the zombie's presence by an event in the physics engine disturbing loose garbage in the dumpster; one playtester thought to toss a grenade in before the zombie ambushed him, and it was a one in million chance that the disturbance happened to bounce the grenade back out), and they liked it so much that they patched it so it would happen every time.
</li><li> The Combine gunships have rather simple AI that sets them to shoot at the most dangerous thing they can see. This is supposed to be the player, as seen in how the gunships will gleefully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman">ignore several AI rebels to ventilate you specifically</a>, but what the devs hadn't accounted for was that rockets fired <em>by</em> the player at it, once they got close, would be tagged as an even bigger threat and shot out of the sky, forcing playtesters to guide their rockets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching">in all manner of odd paths</a> in order to hit them. This proved to be so popular that it was left in as a feature.
</li><li> In a similar act of serendipity that ended up making the game more interesting, during the airboat vs. helicopter battle, the "mine spam" dropped on the player was originally due to one of the programmers accidentally making the helicopter shoot mines out of its machine gun instead of bullets. This was toned down and added in deliberately as the helicopter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> near the end of the battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideOGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideOGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> has had several over its long life.
<ul><li> As players experimented with the original version, players messing around on level editors noticed that if a server's gravity and friction are set a certain way, angled rooftops acted like slick hillsides when your player was walking "up" them. Looking along the plane and strafing "up", then looking slightly "downslope" and then back along it, the character would ski/surf along the plane. This lead to specialized maps, and when a new version of the game running on the Source engine was designed, it was specifically designed to allow players to replicate surfing behavior. A small but devoted set of servers still operate these maps.
</li><li> After an update to <em>Global Offensive</em>'s version of the "Train" map, it was discovered that it was possible to stand on top of birds as they flew away, allowing players to reach unintended spots. This was patched out, but a sign telling players "Do Not Step on the Birds" was added.
</li><li> Also from <em>Global Offensive</em>, there was a trick on "Overpass" in which two players could help boost a third player onto a railing, from which they had a clear vantage point over multiple of the map's chokepoints. This was discovered by the professional team Fnatic, who kept it a secret until they brought it out during the quarterfinals of Dreamhack 2014 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqB95s47f1w">to devastating effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It was very quickly patched, and a "Do Not Climb the Railing" sign was added to commemorate the event.
</li></ul></li><li> One sequence in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> campaign "Hard Rain" involves making your way through an abandoned sugar mill. An odd glitch caused a larger-than-usual number of Witches to spawn in the building; the testers thought this was a stroke of genius, so Valve left the glitch in and wrote the Witch's fondness for the smell of sugar into the backstory.
</li><li> A bug with jumping inertia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes">Starsiege: Tribes</a></em> let skilled players reliably "ski" downhill at high speed to build up speed. When it was fixed, not only after player feedback was it quickly put back in, skiing became a trademark feature of the sequels, even being required at various points in the campaign of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TribesVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TribesVengeance">Tribes: Vengeance</a></em>.

This got used heavily in machinima (most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>), since, particularly when used with pistols, it looked as though the character was at ease rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">constantly pointing his gun at other people</a>. For later installments in the franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> fixed the glitch, but added a feature that allowed a character to put his gun at a "rest" position by tapping down on the D-Pad. For the <em>Anniversary</em> remake of the original, running on the original game's engine, the old bug was deliberately left in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>'s map editor Forge, people used glitches and tricks in order to place objects in ways they weren't supposed to be able to in order to make cool new maps. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> Bungie changed these tricks into features of the new map editor.
</li><li> Possibly inspired by the Honor Guard Councillor glitch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, one of the two types of hidden "BOB" Elites in <em>Halo: Reach</em> is white with a random armor type.
</li><li> "Grenade jumping" is the only way to reach at least a couple of the unlockables in some of the later games, as well as the only way to get the "How Pedestrian" achievement in <em>Halo CE: Anniversary</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Among other things, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em> pays homage to the traditional quirks in FPS physics and some secrets are hidden in ways that require you to take advantage of these. You need to be able to exploit the way the hitbox reacts to almost invisible protrusions in walls to climb them with constant jumping (Asylum). You must at times resort to bunnyhopping (even in circles!) in order to gain enough momentum to leap somewhere else (Castle, Colosseum). You must remember that doing a U-turn in midair is a perfectly plausible thing to do (City on Water). Even rocket jumping has <em>its own hotkey.</em>
</li><li> Any number of weird bugs have been adopted by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> community in order to add bits of interest to their custom levels. Among these: making floors look like water, making enemies nearly invincible, and making "voodoo dolls" of the player character whose deaths will also kill the player (this was used in the final level of the <em>TNT: Evilution</em> half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalDoom">Final Doom</a></em>). Notably, several more modern limit-removing source ports fix these bugs, but also have options to re-enable them for use with mapsets that took advantage of them.
<ul><li> Fans managed to hack <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></em> in order to design their own levels. When id Software developed <em>Doom</em>, they specifically wrote it to be more modular and thus making custom levels much easier - and one of the biggest draws of the first-person shooter genre (the amount of custom content) was born.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first game, Bloodwing won't attack if Mordecai can't see any enemies, even if they're otherwise in range. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, dialogue from Lilith indicates that Bloodwing wanted Mordecai to watch her in action.
</li><li> In <em>Borderlands 2</em>, Axton was originally intended to act flirtatious with Maya when reviving her, but due to a bug his flirtatious dialogue triggered regardless of who he was reviving. Gearbox responded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">confirming</a> in both publicity material and DLC dialogue that he's bisexual.
</li></ul></li><li> Update 11 for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> introduced a glitch where street cops dealt three times as much damage as they were supposed to, which could easily shred a player even on Normal difficulty (especially bad since it was concurrent with a glitch that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">broke armor values entirely</a>). However, enough players liked the challenge the bug presented that sometime after the bug was fixed, the devs then introduced a rarer, more dangerous variation of the street cop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">armed with</a> the much more powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Bronco .44 revolver</a>. Notably, these cops will occasionally spawn during assault waves on the higher difficulties, where street cops and SWAT units are otherwise entirely replaced by the much more durable FBI or ZEAL Team.
</li><li> Slimes stacking up to escape their corrals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlimeRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlimeRancher">Slime Rancher</a></em> was a "happy accident" that resulted of the game's AI telling slimes to seek out food when hungry combined with the game's collision mechanics while being in a confined space, according to the game's developer.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>'s Hammerdins. Basically, Blessed Hammer is a nigh-useless spell on the non-spellcaster Paladin. Due to some bug, the Concentration aura (which should only be boosting physical attacks) boosted Blessed Hammer's damage. This created the Hammerdin, making a Blessed Hammer/Concentration combo a viable character build (with the right equipment, of course). Blizzard made sure it would continue to work properly in subsequent patches. Incidentally, this made Hammerdins into one of the strongest builds in the game (some would argue the strongest) and is a huge gamebreaker. Technically the bug was fixed in the expansion, then <em>put back in</em> on purpose.

</li><li> Although not any specific glitches, one of the first major content updates for the game acknowledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">the game's initial sorry state</a> (so bad that they had to patch things daily for two weeks) by adding a Crash To Desktop spell, which randomly targets anything with less than 10,000 health - including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">the player who cast it</a> - and instantly kills them, alongside several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Puns</a> in a new robe (an old patchwork of several different pieces of fabric), sword (one that's broken off a few inches past the hilt), and staff (one that summons bugs as its unique ability).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident">Corrupted Blood incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where players brought a debuff out of the instance it was supposed to be specific to by infecting their pets with it, calling them away, and then resummoning them in a regular area, later inspired an actual in-game event, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Plague Outbreak</a>.
</li><li> In Vanilla WoW, the paladin talent Reckoning gave the paladin an extra melee attack every time he received a critical hit, stacking up to four times (i.e. at four stacks, the next melee attack the paladin performs would result in 5 simultaneous weapon swings). Originally, there was no upper limit to how many times this ability could stack, resulting in a famous case where a paladin dueled a rogue 'til he'd been crit 10,000 times, then attacked a World Boss and killed it in one blow (while also bringing the server to its knees for several seconds as it tried to resolve 10,001 swings in an instant). This incident became known as "the reckoning bomb." The talent was quickly nerfed, but when the Wrath of the Lich King expansion came out a few years later, it included a quest in which you fired a cannon at scourge invaders in southeast Icecrown and could occasionally shoot an enormous area-effect weapon. The name they gave the enormous area-effect weapon? "Reckoning Bomb."
</li><li> Hearthstones are devices which teleport you to your home base. They have a 10 second casting time, and taking any direct-damage <em>at all</em> during that time completely interrupts its use — this was done to prevent players from using it to get out of trouble. However, until the Cataclysm expansion, the paladin's ability Divine Shield gave him total immunity to all damage for 12 seconds, allowing the paladin to use his Hearthstone uninterrupted <em>even while under attack</em>. Since Divine Shield projected a transparent bubble around the paladin's body, this trick became known as the "Bubble Hearth." The duration of Divine Shield was reduced to 8 seconds in Cataclysm, however, taking the Bubble Hearth ability away and "fixing" this long-standing "bug" — but this caused such an outcry among paladins that, in the subsequent Mists of Pandaria expansion, a minor paladin glyph was added to the game that cut the casting time of your Hearthstone in half while you were under the effect of Divine Shield.
</li><li> Bubble Hearth was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em> as a talent that makes the character Invulnerable for all but the first second of her Hearthstone animation. The character who gets it? Yrel, a Paladin from <em>World of Warcraft.</em>
</li><li> The <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansion added a glyph that allowed druids in stag form to be mounted by other players. Including... other druids in stag form, which allowed players to form <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-j71cuigtM">whole stacks of stags<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> standing atop one another. The bug was quickly fixed, but in a later patch Blizzard released the "Stackable Stag" item as a tribute, a pet that would attempt to stack itself with other stags nearby when the player is idle.
</li></ul></li><li> The bank robbery/mayhem missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Villains</a></em> were originally intended to have the destructible environment scale with the player, however on initial release all the objects were unintentionally locked at fixed, low, levels. This bug became wildly popular because players now had a way of showing their characters becoming more powerful: the car that took forever to destroy at low levels disintegrated with a single attack at a higher level, and area of effect attacks caused massive destruction. The development team realized they'd accidentally hit on a good thing and left it as is.
</li><li> When swimsuits were introduced as equipment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse">Phantasy Star Universe</a></em>, they took up all three clothing slots. A bug allowed characters to equip two layers of clothing at once, which was mostly pointless, but allowed a few would-be fashionistas to wear a swimsuit top with normal pants (or, if their character was male, go shirtless with normal pants). A later patch made swimsuit tops, bottoms, and sandals separate items, making the mix-and-match easier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, certain members-only items of clothing were made available. It was discovered that some of those items (<a class="urllink" href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Gloves_%28Canifis%29">the gloves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) were actually usable on freeplay worlds (instead of being displayed as "member's objects" they were still wearable gloves). Because they could not be obtained on free worlds, some members would obtain them for low prices on their worlds and sell them to non-members for higher prices. They became a symbol of wealth on freeplay worlds, eventually forcing Jagex to keep it in.
<ul><li> An extremely early example (2001 or so) would be the now taken-for-granted feature that makes items only visible to the player who dropped them for about a minute before being visible to everyone else. It was originally a bug, but after it was removed, public demand brought it back.
</li><li> The Falador Massacre of 2006, caused by an error causing kicked partygoers to be flagged for PVP in non-PVP areas (thus able to attack other players who could not retaliate), became part of the game's <em>lore</em> during the 2015 Invasion of Falador event.
</li><li> The Arc update brought the Uncharted Isles, which had (among other things) unique skyboxes. Players quickly figured out that if you teleported away from the island, you kept the skybox. This was used for some fairly spectacular landscape photography before it was patched out... and another update added the ability to basically do the same thing.
</li></ul></li><li> Done since early development in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a></em>. Since exploiting collision glitches, finding ways around an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Wall</a>, figuring out ways to survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">incredibly long drops</a> or just discovering "holes in the world" had long been established as a hobby of MMO players, Mythic had their testing teams specifically look for these things. Instead of blocking them off in one way or another, they would instead put in little secrets and achievements. Which often involved things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">detonation plungers</a> that would give you a shiny achievement badge when clicked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">As well as explode</a> with enough force to land your corpse somewhere around the graveyard, but at least you didn't need to use your Book of Recall!
</li><li> Almost from the get go in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunZ">GunZ</a></em>, ultimately becoming the basis for two widely popular combat styles that make use of a bug in the Sword/dagger that cancels animations, allowing for actions as simple as climbing a wall via dashing at it to multi-key combo moves. However, because of its wide acceptance by the community, many people will look down on or outright kick players who choose to play the game as it was originally intended. The developers opted to leave it in the game, as it was the cornerstone of its gameplay; it's become an official feature in <em>Gunz: The Duel 2</em>.
</li><li> In the same vein as <em>GunZ</em>, there's a number of techniques that have been created through player discoveries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamCapsuleFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamCapsuleFighter">SD Gundam Capsule Fighter</a></em>. The most prominent one is MCA, or "Movement Cancel Action", which allows a player to cancel out a melee dash (where if a player is far enough from an opponent when they use their weapon 1, they'll dash to them) by quickly switching to another weapon, then back to the melee weapon. This results in a unit that quickly slashes at his opponent, but denies him a knock down and, thus, can kill him with ease. This has been left in the game ever since it was discovered on the Korean servers and, when the game updated to Generation 6, added parts that allowed units to earn bonuses for performing this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> had one with the duty officer assignment "Investigate Rumors of &lt;your faction&gt; Intelligence", as in your faction's intelligence service is rumored to be infiltrating your crew. Due to the word "infiltration" being left out of the title, this led to many jokes about your faction being rumored to be intelligent. Cryptic fixed the typo, then <em>put it back in</em> when people complained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>'s intended use of Dualcasting while playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">The Red Mage</a> is born from the way players abused the system in previous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games, where they would use a spell with a short cast time to grant the dualcast bonus, then use that to completely skip the cast time for a more powerful spell that would normally take much longer to cast. The Red Mage's basic rotation is entirely built around this (and balancing white and black mana), starting with weaker spells that have a standard cast time and granting themselves dualcast with it, then using that to instantly cast a more powerful elemental or healing spell that would otherwise take at least twice as long to cast.

<ul><li> Many, <em>many</em> features in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>, which were either bugs in Guinsoo and Pendragon's original game or quirks of the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft">WarCraft</a> III</em> engine, were faithfully ported into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>, and some of them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfNewerth">Heroes of Newerth</a></em> as well. To this day, the main diference between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> is that <em>DOTA 2</em> kept them whereas <em>LOL</em> removed or fixed them.
<ul><li> In earlier versions of DotA, killing your own team's lane creeps completely denied the enemy of experience and possible gold bounty, resulting in huge experience gaps between those who knew this and those who didn't. It was changed to only deny a partial amount of experience, and ever since then denying has been a very important game mechanic.
</li><li> Manipulating creep aggro is another important laning technique. You order your hero to attack an enemy hero on the other side of the creep wave so that enemy creeps aggro you instead of your allied creeps, which helps control the lane so that enemy creeps move closer to your side, near a tower, or let melee heroes get cleaner easier hits on them. Conversely, using your hero or summoned units to block incoming creeps so the creeps meet closer to your tower, allowing you to farm more easily and safely.
</li><li> Orbwalking, which is usable by heroes with autoattack enhancing skills by manually casting the skill rather than having the ability on auto-cast while normally attacking, allows users to harass enemy heroes with your autoattack without drawing creep aggro. You can move your hero in between these skill uses, allowing you to chase more effectively while attacking.
</li><li> Creep stacking — abusing the fact that the neutral creep camps (the "jungle") respawns are not triggered by them being dead, but by the absence of units in a certain area around their spawn point. Because of this, luring a jungle camp far enough away from its spawn point that another one spawns in its place, then letting it walk back will duplicate the camp. Repeat to create a large pile of nearly-identical monsters which you can proceed to farm very quickly with area-of-effect spells. An extremely important technique to increase gold flow, it was nerfed in a few ways in HoN, such as reducing creep aggro time to make stacking multiple camps more difficult and adding a hard limit of maximum stacked camps to 3.
</li><li> Creep pulling — the long lane of each side is especially important, as there is a neutral camp close to the lane where you can lure them into your team's lane creeps, causing your creeps to aggro them until they're killed, allowing the lane to be pushed a lot further to your side and giving the heroes in your lane some more easy gold and experience.
</li><li> The various interactions between spells and spell block/spell immunity. Certain disables will go through spell immunity but <em>becoming</em> spell immune after the fact will dispel them, for instance. DotA is very finicky about what magic immunity does or doesn't block or remove, whereas it's much more straightforward in HoN (Blocks skill effects typed as Magic, and removes negative, removable status effects).
</li><li> When you specify a target destination for Blink Dagger or any Blink-type skill further than its maximum range, you blink only 80% of the maximum distance. It somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a>, though; this used to be in full effect in Dota 2, but it was changed to work this way only for the Blink Dagger.
</li><li> Valve initially deemed the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thescoreesports.com/dota2/news/13809-how-did-this-happen-the-fountain-hook">fountain hooking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> bug (a combo of two characters' abilities that warps a target to certain death inside your spawn point) "too hilarious to fix", but changed their mind after it was used to decide a tournament match, and fixed it in the First Blood update.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>: Lucian's passive ability causes him to attack his next target twice after using an ability. But it turned out that if the enemy you attacked dies before the second hit, the second hit seeks another nearby enemy. The next patch, this behavior was cleaned up a bit and was made a feature.
<ul><li> Lee Sin used to be able to dash to wards. This was removed, then put back in.
</li><li> When Anivia was in egg form, anything her player typed into chat was labelled as coming from "Cryophoenix Egg". This was removed, then put back in when players complained. Now the text comes from "Eggnivia".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LagCancel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LagCancel">Animation canceling</a> is technically a bug in the software of the game that allows players to skip the after-animation of abilities or basic attacks, allowing them to use another ability or attack faster than if they allowed the animation to finish. Allowing the bug to continue to exist is a hotly debated topic, as some champions, such as Riven, become immensely better once players figured out how to animation cancel. Riot has not fixed the bug, and continue to allow its existence on many champions. This is viewed as unfair, because the champion is using abilities and attacks faster than it is supposed to, and is technically bug abuse.
<ul><li> It's become even more controversial at times since Riot has admitted to balancing Riven around animation cancelling and have patched Riven to make it easier for her, while removing animation cancelling from other champions.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the oldest examples in League of Legends is Nunu's channeling spell ultimate, "Absolute Zero" being cast in a bush. Normally, when a spell is cast from a bush, the champion casting the spell becomes visible to everyone. However, Nunu used to remain hidden while channeling his ultimate, that could be used to completely take an opposing team by surprise. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB8xj2QiPtY">It's immortalized as the Empire play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Riot once fixed the glitch,but by that time the glitch had become a staple of Nunu, and the resulting backlash caused Riot to change it back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em>: An update in 2016 caused Blackheart to skip numbers during the pre-game countdown on his battleground. When it was finally fixed, Blizzard also added a sound clip of him going "Uhhh..." that has a chance of replacing a number during the countdown.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinusWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinusWorld">Minus World</a> in the original game was a programming error; however, there are many intentionally hidden stages that are unlocked via similar methods in later games.
</li><li> Not quite a gameplay mechanic, but another nod to the glitch - When Mario arrives in the Underwhere in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>, a Shayde tells him that some call it "World -1".
</li><li> Also in <em>Super Paper Mario</em>, pinning a Koopa shell against a wall and continually jumping on it would (eventually) make you <em>lose points</em>, a nod to the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteOneUps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteOneUps">Infinite 1-Ups</a> instance.
</li><li> Speaking of such, infinite one-ups were included in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em> games, to the point that one of the Hint Movies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em> shows Mario executing the technique (the World 2-3 Infinite 1-Ups video, to be exact).
</li><li> Heck, the infinite one-ups bug was so popular in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that the designers made the glitch possible to do in the very beginning of World 1-1 in the difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2</a>.
</li><li> Again, also in <em>Super Paper Mario</em>, one of the Sammer Guys is named "Over the Flagpole" and talks about cheating. This is regarding a glitch in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> where you... well, go over the flagpole.
</li><li> Another Sammer Guy in <em>Super Paper Mario</em> is named The Negative One, which could be referencing, once again, World -1.
</li><li> Though less of a bug and more of just an oddity, holding an item in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> made the swimming physics change drastically, inexplicably giving the player constant forward momentum and allowing them to swim <em>down</em> instead of up. This was nodded to in <em>Super Mario 64</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, as holding a Koopa shell underwater acted like an underwater jet ski and constantly propelled the player forward; in addition, <em>New Super Mario Bros</em> lets Mario swim slightly faster if he's wearing a blue Koopa shell.
</li><li> Not particularly something added into other games per se, but the Small Fire Mario glitch from the original game is the focus of one of the later challenges in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NESRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NESRemix">NES Remix</a></em>.
</li><li> In the original <em>Super Mario 64</em>, by using the reverse long jump method, Mario can pass through the mirror in the mirror room and explore the area behind it. However, only emptiness waits beyond the mirrored door. In the DS remake, Luigi can use a Power Flower to turn into Vanish Luigi and walk through the mirror to enter the mirrored room, which is required to fight Chief Chilly and unlock Wario. If he passes through the mirrored door, Luigi ends up in complete emptiness, with the exception of himself, the door, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the castle's secret Power Stars</span>.
</li><li> A number of entries in the <em>New Super Mario Bros</em> series canonized a glitch in the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em> where having more than 10 lives prefixed the player's lives count with a crown. Said games max out the player's lives at triple crown, which equates to 1110 lives. Doing so grants the player an award icon on their save file.
</li><li> The team working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em> found a glitch where Mario became extremely thin upon picking up a mushroom power-up. They liked this enough to make a new power-up exclusive to this game; the Weird Mushroom, which makes Mario's limbs long and thin, gives him the trademark physics of Luigi (high jumps, low traction), and adds some bizarre sound effects. It can appear in place of normal mushrooms in the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme, but can be directly placed in levels if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unlock and clear the levels featured in the 2015 Nintendo World Championships</span>.
</li><li> The Double Cherry powerup from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>, which gives you another of your character to control, owes its existence to a mistake made by a developer, where the game would spawn two player characters. Instead of just scrapping it entirely, the development team liked it and thought this would be an interesting concept for a powerup.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros35" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros35">Super Mario Bros. 35</a></em> is not an emulation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, but a complete recreation, meaning that many of the glitches in the original game no longer exist simply because some weird edge case no longer applies in the new engine. However, the power-up double-jump trick still works, suggesting that it was deliberately implemented.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> became exceedingly well-known (and loved) for speedrunning and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>s based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">utilizing glitches</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">circumventing the designers' intentions in the level design</a>. In retaliation, the developers were dead sure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading">keep the player on a fixed path</a> in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>. This caused such an uproar among fans that, for the next game in the series, the developers slid all the way to the other end of the scale and designed the game around giving the player unprecedented freedom. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em> featured rewards for beating the game with minimal items (a classic self-imposed challenge), secret passages which allowed the skipping of "necessary" items, the ability to bomb jump and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a> indefinitely, and the ability to use a charged shinespark in morph ball mode (based on a glitch in <em>Super Metroid</em> dubbed by fans as the "machball").
</li><li> A large amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> and other tricks had to be exploited to win <em>Championship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LodeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LodeRunner">Lode Runner</a></em>. That and the difficulty of this game made it feel similar to some of the very hard ROM hacks.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> for the NES, on rare occasions thrown blocks would fly in a zigzag. It became a chargeable attack in the sequel.
</li><li> The Famicom Disk System version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">Castlevania</a></em> had a glitch that allowed Simon to keep climbing the famous staircase in the final level past where it ends. This became the route to an actual secret in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>.
<ul><li> Also, remember how players of the original NES game would hold the A and B buttons down after grabbing the Red Orb while waiting for the next level to start, causing Simon to repeatedly jump and whip at nothing? Nintendo did — it's one of Simon's victory poses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>, the Kraidgeif glitch was deliberately left in, though not intentionally programmed. It <em>was</em> tweaked to require shot counting and perfect timing or a lot of luck.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transformice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transformice">Transformice</a></em> after a player has jumped, they can not jump again until the running animation has triggered. Due to a bug, the running animation triggers if a player runs into a wall if they are also descending, thus allowing the player to jump again and climb vertical walls. The glitch was so popular that walljumping quickly became an essential part of the game, especially in the much later addition of boot camp mode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky">Spelunky</a></em>, there is a part where to continue to the bonus levels you need to intentionally die, where you respawn inside a statue. This statue is walled off with blocks resistant to explosions, with the intended penalty being that you cannot take any items with you. This is especially problematic for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Eggplant Runs</a>, which requires the player to carry an eggplant through the entire game and use it on the final boss - since a single player cannot take items through the statue, the intention is that multiple characters will have to carry the eggplant between them in co-op play. However, it IS possible to complete a solo eggplant run using the Ball and Chain item, a penalty item obtained by blowing up two of Kali's shrines - due to it being an obscure penalty for something most players would never do, it wasn't tested properly, and the developers forgot to mark the blocks around the statue as being immune to the Ball as well. As a result, a single player with the Ball and Chain can break the blocks around the statue, leave it, pick up the Eggplant, and go back into the statue. Since this is a lot harder than the intended way of doing it, the developers announced that they would <em>not</em> be patching the bug and had, in fact, added an additional animation to it for when it breaks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em>, there was a bug which allowed players to put objects in the background and foreground. Players used this glitch to create full 3D games of all kinds. This later became a feature in LBP3.

While this extends to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> for the same reasons (and also applies to Knuckles if he's chosen as the player character), it is acknowledged when Tails collects the seven Super Emeralds and becomes Super Tails. Upon him doing so, four golden Super Flickies immediately appear onscreen and follow him everywhere, attack any enemy on screen, and turn back to their usual default blue when Tails loses his power.
</li><li> There were glitches that let you turn Tails into Super Tails in <em>Sonic 2</em> and the first-released half of <em>Sonic 3</em> before the combined <em>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</em> added an official version of this form.

Unlike X, Zero's dash stops prematurely if he attacks during it. Rapidly alternating Dash and Attack really fast makes Zero not dash at all and instead repeatedly do his basic starter slash, as opposed to following up with different 2nd and 3rd slashes for a 3 hit combo. The high attack rate made it very useful for being able to rack up damage and stop attacking any time instead of committing to the full combo. When Zero made an appearance alongside X as a pair unit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone">Project X Zone</a></em> the rapid slash, with the same animation as the glitch, becomes one of his normal attacks.
<ul><li> Due to the way the animation for Zero's Kuuenzan works (Zero somersaults with his sword out creating a circular slash attack), many players essentially followed up on a Kuuenzan attack with the later part of the same attack by turning around during the move, so that Zero hits an enemy as the sword goes down then hits them again as the sword goes up by turning around. When Zero made a playable appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em> he has both Kuuenzan and a reverse Kuuenzan in his moveset with the former able to cancel into the latter, recreating the turnaround trick.

</li><li> In the Tiny Tiger boss fight from <em>Warped</em>, you could cheese your way through the more difficult parts of the battle (in which Tiny sics a bunch of lions on you) by hiding out in the upper left corner of the arena. In <em>N. Sane Trilogy</em>, not only is this left intact, but the audience throws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">cheese</a> at you whenever you do it.

<ul><li> The game had a bug that allowed a player to get 100 extra lumber at the start of any game; this was so liked (due to allowing games to get going more quickly) that it became standard tournament practice to use it every game. When Blizzard remade the Battle.net version of the game, they fixed the bug but also had it start each player off with 100 extra lumber.
</li><li> It was also possible to build buildings faster by assigning workers to repair the under construction building. This was included in the sequel, but only for the human faction.
</li></ul></li><li> Blizzard recreated Mutalisk stacking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>, where mutalisks and other air units would be stackable given the right conditions, helping them become harder to focus down. They have acknowledged it as far back as Brood War — rather than get rid of it, they instead added new units to each race whose <strong>sole purpose</strong> is to deal with stacked air units, through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> air-to-air weapons. It's not the only one either. They seem to have intentionally included every interface bug that ever became an element of strategy in the pro circuit, including a few parts of the dodgy unit AI.
</li><li> The way air units move in <em>Warcraft III</em> is descended from this - the units clump together in a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">un-focus-fire-able</a> formation, then explode outwards when they reach their destination or are given attack orders.
</li><li> The Salvage Corvette from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> was only supposed to work on enemy ships that had been heavily damaged, but thanks to a programming error it ended up capable of capturing <em>any</em> ship. It didn't hurt gameplay balance in single-player and the multiplayer community loved it, so it was left in, though it was fixed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HomeworldCataclysm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HomeworldCataclysm">Cataclysm</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld2">HW2</a> went with a different mechanic altogether.
</li><li> "The Beach" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achron">Achron</a></em> is an unusual mechanical version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime">Place Beyond Time</a> - a gap between two "time waves" which is outside causality.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> II</em> has the occasional physics glitch in the base game where an enemy corpse will go spiraling violently off into the stratosphere. It's most noticeable with orks. So, in later expansions Relic decided to make that a feature of how the ork psyker unit, the Wyrd Boy, always dies. It even became part of how the Wyrd Boy dies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a></em>.

One "Second Kingdom" let them have two pharaohs at once and his and Miracle 'son of Osiris' allowed transforming a Pharaoh into a powerful demigod. There was a bug in the original that caused it to occasionally result in getting two pharaohs and one son of Osiris. This was fixed in the expansion by making that combo always trigger.

But then on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> version of IIDX 11, the developers decided to troll players further by adding an Another chart; it's exactly the same as the other difficulties, except the timing windows were shrunk to the point where it's pretty much impossible to score well on it <em>at all.</em> Even worse, DJ Troopers' home version introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> codes that let players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">use the Gambol Hyper and Another timing windows on any song.</a>

When the game was patched, the developers specifically didn't fix the bug because "it was a cool advanced technique".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania">StepMania</a></em> (<em>especially</em> 3.9 and "3.95" - the version used for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove">In the Groove</a></em> 2) had the infamous "negative BPM" bug which could be exploited to cause "warps" in a chart, which could be used for all sorts of interesting effects. The 4.0 branch unfortunately fixed this bug, but the fork sm-ssc (later merged back in as "StepMania 5") adds a new element called a "Warp" (along with "fake" arrows) which can be used for emulating this behavior in a more future-proof manner.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">Peninsula of Power</a>" in the original game was a small, four-tile tip of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">peninsula</a> on the world map that was placed such that it protruded into an encounter zone meant for much later in the game, allowing players to fight much stronger monsters than they would normally be able to when they could first reach it. This one area was incredibly useful for early-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, and has proved so popular the glitch has remained in all subsequent remakes of the game. Other <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles also had small "Peninsulas" of their own due to similar oversights.
</li><li> Similarly, the Critical Hit Glitch. In the original NES release, each weapon had a dedicated critical hit rate in its code, but the combat engine would use the weapon's index number as the critical hit rate instead of the intended critical rate, which had the effect of critical hits becoming more frequent as you climbed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness">Sorting Algorithm of Weapon Effectiveness</a>. For example, Thor's Hammer was intended to have a crit rate of 0.5%, but in practice had a crit rate of 18%. This bug has never been fixed in any remake of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> It's possible that the "Mime" job class introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> was based on a fun glitch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> that caused Kain to copy the previous character's actions in battle. This is also possibly an origin for the Augment system in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>
<ul><li> The well-known Vanish-Doom/X-Zone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">was a really easy way to dispatch pretty much any enemy</a>, and it wasn't fixed in the PSX port, except for one case. Storyline-boss Phunbaba was programmed in the PSX version to be invulnerable to the Vanish spell, because Phunbaba could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">crash the game when being Vanish-Doomed because of how much it messed with the script</a>. Even then, the programmers didn't get the "invulnerable to Vanish" part quite right, since he can still be given the Clear status effect another way. However, the Game Boy Advance version of the game thoroughly squashed the glitch on Phunbaba by making him unable to be hit with the Clear status effect at all.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> references this glitch with the Banish/Death Skill which allows you to instantly win a fight with any enemy whose level is lower than yours.
</li></ul></li><li> The Phantom Train wasn't supposed to be vulnerable to Sabin's Suplex move - the game has a hidden value where enemies that are flying or too heavy could not be affected by it. Someone forgot to set this variable on the Phantom Train, which meant that Sabin is apparently capable of lifting a moving train off of its rails and slamming it back down. Even in later versions where a lot of other bugs were fixed, Square Enix left this one as is, because it's a once-per-playthrough experience that was too popular to omit. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> gave Tifa the Meteodrive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>, which had this effect no matter how big the enemy was.
</li><li> In the original Super Famicom version of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, a bug rendered any item as being equippable as a helmet, with Edgar's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill">drill</a> tool being the best option. <em>Dissidia</em>, already rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gags</a>, saw fit to include a drill as being the headset equip for the 'Machine' equipment set. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a></em> references this as well with the Drill being an artifact with the sole purpose of raising defense.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">fan speculation</a> that the Pokémon Deoxys may be based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlitchEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlitchEntity">Missingno</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">ridiculously high Attack and ridiculously low Defense</a> of its Normal Form would appear to corroborate this, but there has been no official word on whether or not this is the case. Considering that the (intentionally placed) Generation III glitch Pokémon have the exact same stats as Deoxys, this theory is fairly plausible.
</li><li> What <em>isn't</em> speculation, however, is that due to the popularity of Missingno, Game Freak implemented a few intentional glitch Pokémon in the ensuing generations, such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks">?????</a>" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Gold/Silver/Crystal</a></em> (four with the same name), "??????????"/"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Decamarks</a>" and "?" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a></em>, "Bad EGG" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</a></em> and "-----" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black/White</a></em>. Other, non-intentional (and in some cases, dangerous) glitch Pokémon do also appear, but these are repeatable, given intentional names, and are completely benign.
</li><li> Yet another (potential) glitch reference. In <em>Red/Blue/Yellow</em>, the Pokédex number for 'M (likely the second-most-known glitch Pokémon) is "000". Fast forward several years later to <em>Black/White</em>, and Victini's Unova Dex number is "000".
</li><li> There were a pair of Pokémon cards from early in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">the TCG</a>, "Flying Pikachu" and "Surfing Pikachu". Obviously, neither Fly nor Surf could be learned by the famous Electric Mouse Pokémon... until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a></em> allowed the player to obtain a Surfing Pikachu, and <em>Pokémon Yellow</em> included a mini-game which could only be played if you had a Pikachu which Surfed. While it has never been possible to teach or breed a Pikachu with either Surf or Fly, both moves are a legal part of its moveset, and Surfing Pikachu and Flying Pikachu are now common promos in the video games. In <em>HeartGold/SoulSilver</em>, a event for the game's gadget allowed you to go to the Pikachu Forest, allowing players to capture Pikachu who knew Surf and/or Fly
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">This was taken even further</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Generation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndMoon">7</a> event distribution featuring a Pikachu knowing both Surf and Fly. If you haven't heard of it, it's probably because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Korean-only</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In another likely reference to Missingno., when Sirfetch'd <a class="urllink" href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/zbpkxr1gw8/">was initially revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, its appearance was a pixellated mess and its name, category and height were all censored with glitchy blocks of text, not unlike those found in the name of Missingno.'s brethren, such as 'M. According to <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1174307278553374720">the official Pokémon Twitter account<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Rotom was the cause for the corrupted data.
</li></ul></li><li> Smith is a talking horse in the main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaWorldsOfAdventure2MartianDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaWorldsOfAdventure2MartianDreams">Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams</a></em>. Originally, Smith was included in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a>: Quest of the Avatar</em> and was to give a clue on how to beat that game, but the programmers forgot to add it into his conversation tree. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV">Ultima V</a>: Warriors of Destiny</em>, Smith was given back his full dialogue and, up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a>: Serpent Isle</em> (where he almost gives a clue about the actual game), Smith has been giving out clues in the form of untimely information — he tells the player what they should have done to have beaten the <em>previous</em> game, not the <em>current</em> one.
</li><li> A very interesting pseudo-example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>: Whenever a key character in the first game was missing from a scene (which could happen because of glitches), they'd be automatically replaced by a debug character called "Biff the Understudy". In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>, Biff became an actual character with his own subplot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImprobableIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImprobableIsland">Improbable Island</a></em>, at the start of a new day it gives you a message saying. "It is a new day! Strap your &lt;weapon&gt; to your back and head out for adventure!", but if you had no weapon it would just be fists instead. This was removed in one update, but quickly put back in due to popular demand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:

<ul><li> <em>Skyrim</em> has a few physics quirks, one of which causes a player, companion, or random target to fly hundreds of feet into the air after being hit with a Giant's club, in classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">Blown Across the Room</a> fashion. Though unintended, the designers decided not to patch it due to its popularity with players.
</li><li> In "Fall of The Space Core", a semi-official mod that Valve made to commemorate the opening of the Skyrim Steam Workshop, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Space Core</a> can be returned back to space by being within the impact radius of a giant's club swing. It screams "SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE" on the way back up.
</li><li> In the Restoration magic school, there is a perk called "Necromage" which makes magic more potent against undead. Due to an oversight, that perk applies not just to enemy undead but also to the player if the player becomes a vampire, making the vampire player far more powerful. So much so that the main use many players have for the perk is to boost their vampire characters' power.
</li><li> Basically any bug or glitch that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">isn't game-breaking</a> is allowed to stay as long as it's funny (e.g. putting a bucket on somebody's head so they can't see you robbing them blind). The bug that cropped up during development where animals such as chickens would report crimes that they saw didn't qualify mainly because, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">similarly hilarious</a>, it would be unfair to players who didn't know about it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A glitch in the Paragon resolution of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">Conrad Verner</a> side quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> (where Shepard gently talks Verner into going home) flags <em>both</em> the Paragon and Renegade resolutions in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> data. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> ends up reading for the Renegade option first when importing the data, causing it to assume you went with the Renegade resolution (where Shepard threatens Verner into giving up on becoming a Spectre). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, you can encounter Verner on the Citadel, where he apologizes to Paragon Shepard for claiming they threatened him with a gun — he was under a lot of stress.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series, players quickly learned that you wouldn't get blamed for killing someone if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeTag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeTag">reverse-pickpocketed a live grenade</a> onto them; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, this was an easy way to get rid of those annoying child pickpockets in the Den without getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Childkiller</a> perk. Future installments canonized this as a game tactic; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> keeps a running tally of "Pants Exploded" every time you do it (along with an achievement for your first time) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> calls it "the ol' Shady Sands Shuffle."
<ul><li> Companions were added into the original game at a very late stage in development. As such they are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> scripted to follow around the player. This lead to some rather idiosyncratic game behavior which has since become trademarks of the series. First off your companions, like all NPCs, are incapable of getting radiation poisoning. This is useful because it means that the player only needs to worry about getting radiation suits and Rad-X drugs for themselves. This made things much simpler than having to track the health of each party member, and was kept in the games even after Bethesda took over. Another thing was that all interaction with the companions had to occur through the conversation window; this meant that you couldn't directly access their inventory, which lead to cases where a companion wouldn't equip the weapon you wanted them to, and in some cases (if you didn't use the store-interface to provide them with an item of equal or greater value) refuse you give you an item out of their inventory. The developers loved this emergent behavior, since it made it look like the companions had a mind of their own, and matched up with the way that companions worked in <em>Wasteland</em>. Hence they left it in, and it remains in the series to this day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> guns with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Neverending</a> legendary effect draw ammo directly from your inventory without needing to reload. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Gatling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Lasers</a>, however, use long-lasting fusion cores instead of individual bullets, which makes the effect glitch and causes them to have unlimited ammo. Bethesda decided this would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> and made Neverending Gatling Lasers impossible to acquire in the main game. However, for the Final DLC, they added one named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Aeternus</a> that you can get by defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Rogue Knight</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lilith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a></em> was originally supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> character, but a party glitch in the Japanese version allowed her to join the party at a very low level. She was immensely popular, and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PS2</a> remake is an optional but official party member with a revamped moveset.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, there was a bug where the model for mercenary Krem would sit on the back of the chair, stand around the chair, stand on the chair, basically do anything except sit neatly <em>in</em> his chair. The <em>Trespasser</em> DLC later canonized this by revealing he was doing it in order to better see the bard Maryden, who he had a crush on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> contains a scene where after speaking to you, a Mr. Saturn would state that he was leaving, and then promptly exit off the top of the screen. While developing the game, a bug caused the Mr. Saturn to linger just off screen such that after the scene was finished you could find him waiting. They liked it so much they kept it in and added dialogue if you attempt to talk to him again. The game's creator said he liked the idea that Saturn was content just leaving the screen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em>, the translators encountered a weird text glitch that would sometimes cause random words to be blown up to two or three times their normal size, first seen in a sidequest where Estelle says, of Olivier, "He may be a total weirdo, but his gun skills are <strong>LEGIT!</strong>". The translators joked that, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">who she's talking about</a>, "total weirdo" should've been emphasized instead. Sure enough, in the Steam release, "total weirdo" appears at three times the normal text size, causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImStandingRightHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImStandingRightHere">Olivier to call her out.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, King Hassan's Noble Phantasm cancels the death animations of enemies killed by it. One second they're there, the next only their drops remain. The players decided this was <em>awesome</em> and fitting for the greatest Assassin, so the developers left it.
</li><li> When the bosses started using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">Fixed Damage Attacks</a> in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXMavericks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXMavericks">Mega Man X Mavericks</a></em> game, it would cause an approximate amount of their remaining HP to show up by accident. The creator left it in since it was handy for the player to gauge their progress.

If another item is produced when the pools are empty, the game will freak out and create an "Undefined" item, with a sprite that scrolls through almost every item sprite in the game and does nothing upon pick-up. Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Rebirth</a></em>, and one of the new activated items that can be unlocked is "Undefined", which has a sprite made up of parts of other item sprites and displays the same details the original item did when picked up. Item pools are still exhaustible in <em>Rebirth</em> (and, as a possible nod to the original glitch, the Undefined item is one of the easiest ways to do it), but it only results in a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Container</a> item. In <em>Afterbirth +</em>, an achievement was added called "U Broke It!", which rewards the player for exploiting these tricks and receiving 50 items in a single run, which would normally be impossible.
</li><li> The "Buttless Chub" glitch; one of the possible Womb rooms of the original game contained two Larry Jrs. and a Chub. Thanks to the limitations of the game, the Chub spawned without her third segment, leaving her unable to spawn maggots from it. The room still exists in <em>Rebirth</em>, and Chub is still missing her behind despite the new engine being able to handle it.
</li><li> The Polaroid was a trinket that let you access <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> in the <em>Wrath of the Lamb</em> expansion. Originally it was supposed to have a very low drop rate from Mom, but it was accidentally made to drop 100% of the time on release. Rather than patch it out, the devs let it be since the final area was no longer a secret. Come <em>Rebirth</em>, and it's now a passive item so it doesn't take up your trinket slot, and even has a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> you can take instead.
</li><li> One trinket, the Liberty Cap, was glitched so that it sometimes gave the effect of the Compass item (which would reveal all special rooms on a floor) for a single room, rather than act as a random mushroom item. This effect carried over to <em>Rebirth</em>.
</li><li> Isaac's weird hitbox allowed him to walk diagonally in-between spikes and avoid taking damage from them in the original game. This is still possible in <em>Rebirth</em>, but it requires more precision.

<ul><li> Anyone who has ever played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em> will recall that the enemy ships slowly speed up as you destroy more of them. This was due to an oversight by the original programmer — moving that many pixels around<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jvlp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2jvlp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jvlp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Space Invaders</em>, unlike most later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Games</a>, lacked hardware sprites</span> loaded down the processor, slowing the game down considerably. As the ships were destroyed, the game had less processing to do, so it ran faster. He liked it so much that he left it in, and every <em>Space Invaders</em> game since has done the same. The significance of this oversight extends further than merely subsequent Space Invaders games — it introduced the entire concept of difficulty curves to video games.
</li><li> The egregiously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> III AC</em> had significant slowdown when there was a lot of enemies/bullets on the screen, which was practically required to navigate these bullet storms. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PS2</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Compilation Re-release</a> even had an option to emulate the lag/slowdown. Similar to the <em>Street Fighter II</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> examples, this would influence other games, as intentional, hardcoded slowdown when bullet density reaches a certain point has become a widespread feature in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> games.
</li><li> The arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DoDonPachi Saidaioujou</a></em> had a glitch where if your combo bonus exceeded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersOfTwoMinusOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersOfTwoMinusOne">(2^31 - 1)</a>/100, it would turn into 999,999,999 because the programmers correctly detected the overflow but used 32-bit fixed-point signed integers instead of 64-bit ones in the intermediate calculations. This would then send your score through the roof. When the game was ported to Xbox 360, the glitch was fixed, but Arcade HD Mode contains an option to restore the original glitched behavior.
</li><li> The PC-98 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> games had a glitch where using a bomb <em>very</em> shortly after getting hit would cause you to not die. The Windows games intentionally coded this in, called it "deathbombing", gave it a more reasonable usage window, and some games like <em>Imperishable Night</em> actually made it a key feature.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Simulation Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a></em> game, there was a rather odd glitch in which an emperor penguin in a proper exhibit (for penguins anyway) would kill any other non-penguin herbivore added to said exhibit. In the sequel, this is fixed, but messing too much in the genetic lab minigame that comes with an expansion pack will result in a psychotic rockhopper penguin with teeth, red glowing eyes and a taste for dinosaur meat. Placing any other animal (or a particularly annoying guest) in the same exhibit as the creature will result in an untimely demise, even a T-Rex. And you can't sell it. EVER. If someone offers you a penguin to adopt, DON'T accept!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlayStationHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlayStationHome">Play Station Home</a></em>, it was possible to do a glitch in any home to clip through walls. By placing a Subway Cooler with the front against a wall and sitting on it, once you stood up, you phased through the wall. Doing this in the home "Cutteridge Estate" by putting the Subway Cooler in the room adjacent to a locked room allowed you to clip into the completely empty room. Eventually the glitch was patched, but if your Subway Cooler was still in place, you could see into the locked room, which was now covered in vibrant, green, Joker-esque paint all over the walls saying "GET OUT!" Eventually, Sony decided to do something more with the locked room, and the house was changed in an update; a crap-ton of padlocks and chains were placed on the locked door, but there were also games added to the home to get a few pieces of an incantation to blow the door open. This unlocked another game, and completing that unlocked the Demonic Cutteridge Estate home, which is much more overt with its scares, compared to the original's more subdued spookiness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia">Startopia</a></em>, it's possible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">mindblowingly rich and lazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Gem Slugs</a> to have their own private, personalised bar and bathhouse. The only reason they exist at all is because happy Gem Slugs produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolidGoldPoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolidGoldPoop">Solid Gold Poop</a>. However, it's also very much possible for a Gem Slug to glitch and get stuck in their baths and neglect their health, eventually dying. The developers caught it early, but didn't patch it, instead leaving it in and explaining it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a>.

<ul><li> NPCs have a single line of dialogue per level of appreciation when given a gift. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Abigail's</a> line for "liked" items is "Hey, how'd you know I was hungry? This looks delicious!", even though said items include several non-edible minerals and gemstones. Despite the developer's noted fast response to glitches, he not only left it in, but in a later update, he <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/Nrctfhg">added post-marriage dialogue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Abigail further affirming her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">Extreme Omnivore</a> tendencies.
</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> one: When using a club, using the special attack (right-click on PC) and then mashing the regular attack (left-click on PC) will cause a bunch of hits to happen all at once, which can kill enemies very quickly. This was (presumably) not intended at first, but in the 1.4.1 update, the developer fixed an animation bug caused by this issue, but left the actual multi-hit in the game (referring to it as "the club slam repeat quirk"), which suggests that it has now become this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2">HITMAN 2</a></em> was coded so that throwing weapons will always hit their target, and will steer themselves mid-flight to compensate for moving targets. Fans discovered that the ICA Briefcase was both very large and had a very slow travel speed, leading to surreal moments when it would float through the air and steer around corners in pursuit of targets. This glitch was fixed by increasing the travel speed of the briefcase. Later a new briefcase item with the original behavior, the ICA Executive Briefcase MKII, was added as a free unlock.

<ul><li> In <em>Tiger Woods PGA Tour '08</em>, there was a glitch nicknamed the "Jesus shot" which meant that in the right conditions, a ball hit into the water could still be played, complete with the golfer walking on water to hit it. Prior to the release of the 2009 edition, EA responded with a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ1st1Vw2kY">live-action recreation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the shot, claiming "It's not a glitch. He's just that good." Then, in the 2010 edition, the first bonus challenge was to recreate the scene, earning the achievement "Levinator25", named after the person who discovered the glitch.
</li><li> In <em>Madden NFL 15</em>, a typo meant that Christian Kirksey's height was coded as 1'2" instead of 6'2", resulting in an action-figure-sized Kirksey running around the field alongside full-sized players. EA quickly embraced the glitch, holding a weekend Ultimate Team Challenge in which players could challenge the "Tiny Titan", and conducting a mock interview with a shrunk-down Kirksey (who himself found the glitch hilarious).

One of the playable characters, Cheston, is capable of activating a skill that caused him to pound the ground in mid-air, causing him to rocket forward quickly. The developers liked it enough that instead of removing the glitch, they added additional skill drain when RJing to balance it out. A similar physics glitch results in incredibly fast movement speeds when moving off of ledges, over jump pads, or even using mobility skills in mid-air. Consequently, the old "low mobility" label on Enforcers was removed, since only the Gunner at the time really lacked a way to zoom across the arena.

<ul><li> To explain this in greater detail, whenever Elzam Branstein would use an attack or do something that triggered his theme in the first game he appeared in, his theme would override anything that was playing in the background, even final boss music. The reason for this is that themes have their own priority, with higher-priority songs overriding lower-priority ones. Elzam is initially fought as a boss, thus his theme has higher priority than the player characters' - when he later joins you, a glitch causes player-theme priority to be <em>added</em> to his boss priority rather than <em>overriding</em> it as it should. The fandom found this hilarious, due in no small part to his theme being awesome, and Banpresto has deliberately included it in every SRW game where he appears since. It even overrides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Komm, susser tod</a> in the <em>End of Evangelion</em> route from <em>Alpha 3</em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The creeper's model was that of a failed pig model. The model failed due to Notch attempting to make the pig model longer horizontally, but he botched the coding and it made the model grow longer vertically instead, which also made the legs look weird in that position. Notch liked how creepy it looked and dubbed it the Creeper.
</li><li> When the pistons were added, people soon realized that they sometimes got stuck in an incorrect state and need to be "updated" to make then snap back to their expected state. Ingenious people managed to transform this glitch into so-called block update detectors that significantly expanded the ways redstone mechanisms can interact with the rest of the game world. Another, unrelated glitch with the pistons made it possible to propagate redstone signals arbitrarily far within a single tick (0.1s). This enabled the players to circumvent the intended 150m/s limit. This later capacity was expanded in the next update, making it significantly easier to transmit instantly both edges of the signal.
</li><li> Green-robed villagers, which were unused at first, could be spawned using commands but would not offer any trades since none were implemented for them. While they were removed temporarily in 1.8 due to a game crash bug when attempting to trade with them, they later came back in 1.11 as the Nitwits, with their lack of trades becoming their defining feature, and were carried forward with the major village overhaul in 1.14.
</li><li> The Nether is supposed to be a gigantic cavern, which means it's the only one of Minecraft's dimensions that has a physical ceiling, capped off with a layer of bedrock. It was possible to clip through the bedrock and end up on top of the Nether-roof, but at that point you were stuck, since it was above the build height limit, and since the entire area was a flat plane of bedrock, there was no way to get back down. However, in Minecraft Beta 1.8, when the build height limit was changed from 128 blocks to 256 blocks, the roof of the Nether was never lifted higher. This meant that players could now build on the Nether-roof, which immediately meant it got a lot more attention. The Nether-roof became essential for things like gold farms and Nether hubs, since there are no blocks to clear out, and no areas to spawnproof (nothing spawns on bedrock). Getting onto the roof was always tricky and required the use of various clipping and bedrock-breaking glitches, but in update 1.15, Mojang made it so Nether Portals in the Overworld could be linked to a portal on the Nether-roof, and the height of the Nether was not changed when the entire dimension got an overhaul in version 1.16.

</li><li> The PC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> includes some glitches that have been left in, such as the ability to create invisible limbs and therefore make parts on the created creature float in midair. Another glitch made it possible to create asymmetrical creatures, and a later patch upgraded this to an actual feature, with a simple keybind to get the previously tedious effect. Though, asymmetrical ships, vehicles and outfits tend to look better than creatures themselves.
</li><li> An update added the Captain's Quarters to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, which include various virtual screens bombarding one's avatar with videos. Some nifty people located these videos in the game folder and fiddled with them a bit, to change them to videos they liked. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.eveonline.com/article/you-just-won-a-brand-new-flat-screen-tv-ready-for-pickup-in-your-local-captains-quarter/">Eventually, CCP made it very easy to do so without needing to change any of the game data.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> franchise is one. It started life as a pretty normal racing simulator with police who pull over racers. However, the AI for the police was far too aggressive and started slamming into racers. Playtesters had much more fun dueling with the police than doing the racing, so the developers made that a core gameplay component. And a franchise was born.
</li><li> While developing necromancy for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, Toady accidentally created undead from the skin and hair of a killed monster, as well as its skeleton. He figured it made as much sense as skeletons and zombies, and kept it. Nowadays undead skins and hair are among the most dangerous of all DF creatures, since they have no vitals, don't need to breathe, and don't bleed out from massive damage — short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">cave-in, atom-smasher</a>, or encasing in ice/obsidian, they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">cannot be killed</a></em>. There was also one update where Toady fixed the "glitch" where meals made entirely of booze would melt below room temperature - rather than the glitch that lets you make meals entirely out of booze in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">Stunts/4D Sports: Driving</a></em> has the sixth gear bug, invoked by racing at full tilt in the fastest car in the game and going over a ramp, accelerating to half the speed of sound and remaining that way until you let go of the throttle. Naturally this was done on purpose in many user created maps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoatSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoatSimulator">Goat Simulator</a></em> does it <em>on purpose</em>. The game is full of deliberate bugs and glitches, probably to evoke the fun of finding physics glitches in more "serious" games. One of the selling points on its Steam store page admits that anything that doesn't crash the game is "hilarious and we're keeping it".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em>, there were two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game Breaking Bugs</a> in the original mod; you could close the door to your office, trapping you inside, and you can kill yourself by repeatedly jumping off of the scaffolding in the Mind Control room. Both these eventually became fully fledged endings in the HD Remake (<em>Reluctance</em> and <em>Stop Moving</em>, respectively).
<ul><li> There's also the ability to trap yourself by stepping out of the elevator before the doors close. In HD, you can do this with the door to the boss' office, enabling another new ending.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><h2>Non-video game examples:</h2>
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a>, including the stories made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a>, Huey, Dewey and Louie would sometimes be mistakenly drawn as four ducklings instead of three. This led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> about a mysterious fourth nephew, getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of Phooey. In the 1999 comic <em>Much Ado About Phooey</em>, it was eventually explained that some kind of weird electric/physic mishap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">caused by lightning</a> would cause a clone of the three boys to momentarily appear, and the name "Phooey" was canonized. It would get referenced again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>, where one episode has Dewey reveal he occasionally dreams that the brothers have a fourth sibling named Phooey.
</li><li> There's a web-enabled tool for creating fonts called <a class="urllink" href="http://fontstruct.com/">Fontstruct<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There was a glitch that enabled you to stack bricks you use to create fonts. In the version 2.0 update in 2010 they made it an actual feature.
</li><li> Traditional automatic transmissions using a fluid coupling and planetary gearset "creep" when in gear and not held against the brake. Continuously variable and dual-clutch automated manual transmissions don't have to, but are designed to anyway since that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutEffect">what drivers expect</a> in a two-pedal transmission system.
<ul><li> Designers have learned that without the precise low speed control from this creep or from feathering the clutch on a manual, a car becomes almost impossible to park. Even electric cars have added a creep feature despite having direct drive systems and the ability to turn power on and off at any time.
</li></ul></li><li> A glitch on the adoptables site <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/UniCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/UniCreatures">Uni Creatures</a> replaced the sprite for Flarius (a standard fire-breathing dragon) with that of Caprine (a goat). Shortly afterwards, the mods released a new creature: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">goat-dragon</a> Capricious.
</li><li> Serious example with costly consequences: during the dark ages of early CPU designs, some CPUs either wouldn't do what they were supposed to do when fed certain instructions, or yielded completely unexpected results. This in turn forced OS programmers to anticipate those glitches to make <em>their</em> side of things work as designed. This phenomenon came full circle when the CPU designers were later forced to incorporate the bugs of the early CPUs just so those dubious OSs would work properly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">And so on and so forth.</a> This has been one of the reasons why the x86 instruction set (used by Intel, AMD, and others) is so ludicrously huge; it contains tons and tons of Ascended Glitches.
</li><li> It doesn't stop with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">metagame</a> between CPU designer and OS programmers. Suppose you have a huge set of data stored in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">an obscure and outdated system</a>, the kind that has been out of production for more than a decade. You want to retrieve that data to store in a shiny new system. So you grab an instruction manual and build an emulator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">to emulate</a> the environment in which the system used to run. When you actually run it, the old system promptly crashes and lets out a strange-smelling puff of smoke (which is probably your data). Why? It's because the programmers of the old system didn't actually build their things according to the reference manual but to the behavior of the real boards-and-cables environment they had in hand. No wonder the system choked inside your environment.
</li><li> This was one of the main reasons why Windows Vista had so many problems with older software being incompatible. Vista cleaned out a lot of the bugs and glitches from previous iterations of Windows, which may have sounded great on paper, but a lot of Windows software had been built around those bugs and glitches. Most notably, Vista no longer automatically gave administrative rights to every user account — something that many programs had taken for granted on XP and earlier versions of Windows. A lot of software needed to be patched to account for these changes.
<ul><li> Compatibility mode in an operating system or browser is essentially this: turning on compatibility mode adds intentional bugs that replicate the behaviour of unintentional bugs in previous versions so software and websites designed around (or based on) those bugs works correctly.
</li></ul></li><li> Just before the filming of the first regeneration on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, it was discovered that a vision mixing desk was faulty in such a way that adjusting a specific control would overexpose the image. This was seized upon to create the iconic shot of William Hartnell's face dissolving into Patrick Troughton's, and by doing so, influence the visual look of almost all the other regenerations. Originally, the intention had been to have the Doctor collapse with his cloak over his face, and just pull it back to reveal he'd turned into Troughton.
</li><li> The early electro-mechanical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Contact">Contact</a></em> did not include a noisemaker of any kind. As a joke at Pacific Amusement, one of the employees wired a doorbell buzzer to the Contact Switch on a demo table — every time it was hit, owner Fred McClellan thought his phone was ringing and tried to answer it. When the bell proved to be an attention-getting device, it was added to all subsequent machines.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> first edition monster manual, a typo had Mummies powered by positive energy instead of negative like other undead. This distinction was uncorrected long enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DragonMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DragonMagazine">Dragon Magazine</a> and the fandom to pick it up and run with it, enough so that mummies being positive energy creatures was a central point in the Van Richten guide to Mummies. Many fans never knew this started as an error until it was "fixed" in 3rd Edition.
</li><li> Animation-to-fanfic example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, the fish that Kagami nabs at a summer festival is later shown to be living in a pond with nothing but rocks in it. Whether this was a shortcut on the animators' part or based on the assumption that such will suffice for a goldfish, it becomes a plot point in a fanfic titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Starbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Starbound">Starbound</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>, Vanellope is an in-universe example. She's a glitch because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turbo tried to delete her code when he became King Candy</span>, but through the movie she learns to control her glitching so that it's actually helpful to her. At the end, when the game resets, she actually keeps the glitch as a special character power and players in the arcade love using her because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BeatTheDrumsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BeatTheDrumsOfWar">Beat the Drums of War</a></em> referenced a mistake by Cryptic that went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> has long had a mistake in the title of a doff assignment, "Investigate Rumors of Klingon Intelligence". This was meant as "Klingon Intelligence has infiltrated your ship" but led to jokes about Klingons being rumored to be intelligent. Including one made by Eleya on Lae'nas III in-story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VinesauceTomodachiLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VinesauceTomodachiLife">Vinesauce Tomodachi Life</a></em>, the live-streamed nature of the series means that several errors the game has caused have been incorporated into the narrative in some way.
<ul><li> In Episode 30, Vinny is watching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown">Clown</a> hang out with a few other islanders, and sees him appear to walk through one of them. He decides that this means Clown is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">a ghost</a>, and it's since become the most well-known aspect of his character.
</li><li> Twice, once in Episode 28 and again in Episode 54, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the game ends up crashing while Vinny is playing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">before he was able to save</a></span>. Vinny has implemented this into the story by saying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">those crashes are actually "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">dimensional splits</a>" that divide the island into separate continuities</span>. This also fleshed out one character, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">Isaac</a> was connected to the crashes in some way, which has caused him to be characterized as a chaotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> with an allegiance to Jesus (who has also been connected to the crashes)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1980s game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck">Press Your Luck</a></em> had a game board with eighteen screens with values that almost always changed at the same time, but half of the screens would occasionally change out of sync with the other half. Its revival, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Whammy">Whammy</a></em>, actually implementsand even amplifiesthis behavior. While the screen values always change at the same time during <em>Whammy</em>'s first round, the screens change independently from each other at semi-random intervals in the second.
</li><li> When Subaru tried to put their EJ engine into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Impreza WRX</a> model they noticed they did not have enough room for a proper, equal length exhaust header setup. Having no choice they decided to use a less optimal unequal length headers. This reduced power and torque, but produced a very distinct burbling sound. WRX became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> among car enthusiasts for its performance, rallying achievements and of course the sound. After Subaru moved to the next generation FA engine, it finally had room for equal length headers and decided to use them. Cue cries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a> for the fandom and aftermarket companies selling (way less efficient) unequal length headers for the FA.
</li><li> A certain early IBM monitor-based terminal had an interesting bug: When downloading a new symbol set, the screen would flash green streaks, sometimes called "Green Lightning". This was intentionally not fixed, and in fact later versions of the terminal had that feature designed into it, because it served a useful purpose: telling the user that the terminal was not frozen, merely engaged in work that the user could not immediately see.
</li><li> Glitches in video game consoles that resulted from hardware limitations tend to be replicated in video game emulators and source ports, often optionally, for fans who believe such glitches enhance the game or for purists who wish to emulate the game as closely as possible to how it worked on the original hardware. Things like sprite flickering, slowdown when too many sprites are on the screen (which could serve as an impromptu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a>), and scanlines from old CRT televisions (which somewhat blurred pixels like a primitive form of anti-aliasing and is often preferred to the crisp blocky pixels on newer LCD monitors) are found in almost all emulators.
</li><li> Fitting for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComic">Web Comic</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic">heavily incorporates video game elements</a> in its worldbuilding, story structure, and characterization, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwfulHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwfulHospital">Awful Hospital</a></em> got a small one of these in the form of<strong> '1['. </strong> On <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bogleech.com/awfulhospital/850.html">Layer 850<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a typo in the page's HTML caused the letters '1[' to appear in the upper left of the page, and in the few days before the next page was uploaded, commenters made it into a meme. On the very next page, a character lists off several mysterious, poorly understood entities throughout the range, including "<strong>1[</strong> ...Now there's a NASTY bugger". We've yet to see if it'll get more than that one allusion, but still.
</li><li> So called "broken colors" could be considered a form of this. They basically occur when your eye sees a combination of wavelengths of light and can't really classify them, so renders them as a non-spectral color, with brown and grey being the most common. Essentially, it's your eye giving you an error message.
</li><li> Some biologists think the female orgasm is actually a vestigial response that's hung around, as unlike the male orgasm it doesn't seem to play any role in reproduction (aside from further incentivising the act, of course). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Most women aren't about to complain though.</a>
</li><li> Trying to make Microsoft Sam say "soy" makes him say "schwa" instead, and typing "soi" instead doesn't fix it. Later versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Microsoft Windows</a> come with text-to-speech voices that pronounce "soy" correctly but deliberately pronounce "soi" like "schwa."
</li><li> While writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> kept writing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a>," which he described as "a piece of private bad grammar"—at that time, "dwarfs" was considered the only correct plural. He opted to leave it in, however, and one sign of his influence is that nowadays you're far more likely to find people spelling it his way.
</li><li> This is essentially how evolution works.
