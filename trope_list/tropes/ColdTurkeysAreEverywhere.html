<ul><li> Basically the entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonsRioting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonsRioting">Dragons Rioting</a></em>, as protagonist Rintaro has a medical condition which means he can die if he gets sexually aroused. Naturally, he ends up attending a school with a vastly majority-female student body, most of whom are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> of one type or another. A decade of intensive martial arts training and meditation to focus his mind on whenever he's presented with something sexy is the only thing keeping him alive.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a> Overload</em> manga, Sousuke is prohibited by Kaname to bring guns to school for one day. He actually starts getting <em>withdrawal symptoms</em> from not firing a gun. Everything starts looking like moving targets, he hears gunfire, and everyone starts looking like thug-ish terrorists. He eventually breaks and starts attacking Kaname's classmates, thinking they're trying to kill her. In the end, Kaname takes him outside and lets him have target practice with an empty can. It ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">her seeing the importance of allowing him to shoot guns (lest he start going crazy)</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> has an episode where Mint is told that if she continues her obsession with wearing mascot-type animal costumes, she'll die. This diagnosis conveniently coincides with the Angel Brigade's trip to a planet that is celebrating "wear an animal costume day". While on the planet, she is the millionth customer of a local supermarket and is awarded several animal costumes. Then she attends an award ceremony where the mayor of the town awards her another one. Then she throws the animal costume people are trying to make her wear into a lake, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe">gets offered silver and gold animal costumes by the water spirit in the lake</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty">Heaven's Lost Property</a></em>, where Sakurai Tomoki is a major pervert, with exceptional love for panties, and he got a hold of a HUGE amount of panties after a certain event. It made his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> mad, and... It didn't end pretty. It appears she turned the panties to BOMBS that explode each time he looks at them. He had to try and resist looking at his adored panties until he's out of his home... They were quite literally everywhere. In the end, he gave up and embraced EVERYTHING. He lost his house as a result. Seriously, the sheer hilarity of that cannot be described.

Later in season 2, Ika tries to get over her obsession with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">shrimps</a> and ends up with a classic case of this — including a whole heap of "today only" offers at the supermarket. Then, somewhat atypically, when she GIVES UP, she gets an INVERSE case — now, suddenly, it's impossible to find shrimps ANYWHERE...

Little M. suggests that if they don't think about food, their hunger will go away, and the two try to find something to watch on TV to get their minds off the matter. Every show they see on the TV is related to food in some way.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Lamput" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Lamput">Lamput</a></em> episode "Diet Doc", Fat Doc takes a drive through town and tries not to let some nearby fast food restaurants tempt him into ruining his new diet. Lamput, who is in the car with him, abuses this to his advantage by morphing into a chicken drumstick, which is just enough to make Fat Doc go to one of the restaurants to gorge down on some fried chicken anyway.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one comic, Daisy bets Donald that he couldn't go a day without eating anything. Cue a guy handing him a fresh hot dog (he can't take it with him on the bus), Grandma Duck nominating him as a judge in the local bake-off, and a college roommate dragging him into a restaurant as a celebration of their reunion and ordering everything on the menu. In the end, Donald is undone when Daisy catches him eating a chocolate bar, but he cheats by re-adjusting his wristwatch to trick her into thinking that it's already past midnight. The next week, they go on a date at a luxurious mountain hotel known for its all-you-can-eat buffet, but Donald gets into an accident which injures his mouth, rendering him incapable of eating anything besides soup.
</li><li> Donald's not in it, but a later story had Daisy writing in her diary about being determined to stick to her diet, naturally everything she then sees or hears (or smells) is solely about delicious food. In desperation, she finally locks herself in her room to avoid temptation... then gives up and bites a chunk out of her notebook in frustration.
</li></ul></li><li> The old kids' comic <em>L'il Jinx</em> had Jinx, after listening to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">Shoulder Angels</a>, decide to <em>not</em> filch cookies from the cookie jar. Cue being offered cookies, being tempted by things that just <em>look</em> like cookies... The inevitable punchline comes when she tells her mother how good she was and her mom notes the jar was empty anyway (she was just baking a fresh batch to fill it). Jinx proceeds to stuff the morality imps in the jar and enjoy some cookies (with permission).

At the same time, a romance author who lives in Frasier's building is moving out. When Frasier and Kate get in the service elevator, to avoid the press outside the main door, it stalls and the lights go out. Frasier lights some candles then knocks a double mattress propped against a wall, dropping it on the center of the floor. The heat forces them to take off their jackets. Then Frasier accidentally sets off a music box that plays romantic music, knocks over a bottle of musk oil trying to turn it off, and when Kate grabs a sheet to soak up the oil, it turns out to be covering a huge blow-up of a bodice-ripper cover. They resist, but only just.
<ul><li> Deliberately invoked by Daphne in "Hungry Heart." Jane Leeves, who played Daphne, became pregnant during the run, and the producers' attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourPregnancy">conceal her baby bump</a> failed when the naturally-svelte Leeves gained a good deal of weight. To compensate, the writers added a subplot involving Daphne stress-eating to deal with the frustrations in her life. When she vows to give up the junk food and lose weight, she sets this trope on <em>herself</em> by secretly hiding various sweets and desserts all around Frasier's apartment, allowing her to sneak snacks whenever she likes. Given that the main characters were psychiatrists, though, the show took the trope more seriously than others, noticing that Daphne's inability to stop was serious and prompting a trip to a spa to help her deal with the root of her problem (which in turn allowed Leeves time off to have her baby).

When Ashley's boyfriend comes in for their date, he asks if she's ready ("NO MAN SHE'S ONLY 13!"). Then, on the TV, the game announcer asks "Where is the most unusual place you've made whoopee?" Then, when Will turns on the radio, all that comes on is the song "I Wanna Sex You Up" (which is a real song).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em>. There's the episode where Dexter's Mom bakes some muffins and Dexter has to prevent his dad from eating them (apparently, he's a "muffomaniac" and Mom even says that he only married her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">because of her muffins</a>). Dad starts to hallucinate that's he's in a land of muffins and is crowned king. All in all, it was a very bizarre episode.

The Ed's, Kevin, Rolf, and Johnny all make a cold turkey bet, each ponying up 25 cents as the bet. Ed can't have gravy, Double D can't use any big words, Eddy can't be loud, Rolf must give up meat, Johnny can't talk to Plank, and Kevin (the first to lose) can't call the Eds dorks. After Eddy spends most of the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoking</a> the trope towards everyone else, the eventual winner is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ed.

Garfield being Garfield, he's wondering if the five minutes is up within seconds. He leaves the house, but everywhere he goes, he's offered food: a pair of picnickers who brought too much food; the Buddy Bears, who give him "a light snack" as a token of friendship, which he nearly <em>does</em> eat; even restaurant owners, who normally fear his approach lest they be eaten out of business. In the end, he is almost mistaken for having eaten, and indeed, very nearly bites down on a banana when the time runs out.

</li><li> Helga tries to get over her obsession of Arnold that she tries not thinking about him, naturally she sees images of him everywhere across town. She was able to remedy this when she buys an out-of-love potion, and she stops seeing images of him, but it left her bored and empty.

Goofy ends up being their waiter. You can see where this is going...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but it's a subversion.

<ul><li> A few shorts featured Sylvester going through this while trying to give up eating Tweety, most memorably in "Birds Anonymous".

</li><li> In another Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, after various failed attempts to catch Tweety, Sylvester decides to swear off birds.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Undie Pressure", the Loud siblings are on a bet which means that Lori isn't allowed to talk to her boyfriend Bobby, Leni isn't allowed to use the word 'like', Luna isn't allowed to talk in a British accent, Luan isn't allowed to tell jokes, Lynn isn't allowed to turn things into sports, Lincoln isn't allowed to read comics in his underwear, Lucy isn't allowed to scare people, Lana isn't allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilthyFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilthyFun">play in the mud</a>, Lola isn't allowed to look at her reflection, Lisa isn't allowed to study, and Lily isn't allowed to cry. They all experience this trope in some way except for Leni, Lucy, and Lily: Bobby comes over, there is a British accent competition, people set up jokes, there are opportunities to turn the laundry into a sport, Lola turns the thermostat up making Lincoln want to strip, it's raining and the pets are playing in the mud, Lincoln polishes the surfaces so Lola will be tempted to look at herself, and Lori goes to poop (and Lisa was studying poop).
</li><li> In "Deal Me Out", Lincoln and Clyde try to give up things relating to their favourite superhero Ace Savvy, yet they find comics and action figures of him everywhere.
</li><li> Attempted in "No Laughing Matter" where Luan tries to give up telling jokes, and her siblings try to tempt her by setting up jokes, but she isn't tempted.

He technically manages to stay clean for about half a year before finding confiscated cocaine behind the stage of a drug-free concert. He eventually gives in once the security guarding the drugs disappear to handle the concert which had gone haywire. Also note that this happened after a whole episode dedicated to his struggle to get clean early on in the same season. This was done mostly because Dr. Rockso happened to be the show's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, and part of his charm was his insufferable cocaine addiction.

It gets so bad, that the Doctor Barber recommends a rather painful surgery to cure him but agrees to let Flapjack try to help the captain quit cold turkey as an alternative. Also, when K'nuckles wanted to stop hearing stories with happy endings, everybody was telling stories with various different kinds of happy endings.

</li><li> When Lisa turns vegetarian, everyone seems to force her to eat meat, and events culminate during Homer's barbecue party.
</li><li> When Homer gives up beer, he cannot escape Duff advertising and cans of beer appear to be everywhere (including literally bombarding him with beer cans).
<div class="indent"> <strong>Surrender to Duff</strong>
</div></li><li> Lisa was addicted to the "Cory Hotline" and is forced to never call it from home. She cheats and uses the school's phone. With Marge's help, she resolves to spend a whole day without calling, made incredibly difficult because of withdrawal-like symptoms and Maggie playing with a toy phone. Although it seems that she fell asleep dialing the hotline, Marge finds out she succeeded after all, and only dialed information to know the time and prove she went the whole day.
</li><li> In "The City of New York versus Homer Simpson", town drunk Barney Gumble is declared the evening's designated driver. Of course, that's the night that Duff Beer spokesman "Duffman" shows up to put on the party that Barney won (but obviously can't take part in).
</li><li> In a comic book, Marge makes Homer agree to eat only one doughnut a day. As he drives to work, he sees a doughnut-shaped cloud. Then more such clouds. And then a cloud shaped like an open box full of doughnuts, with the words "EAT US, HOMER" written on it. Naturally, he does not stick to the plan for long. That was the first issue. He does sort of stick to the plan, but cheats.

The show focuses on a duck named Bill and his relationship with Aldo, an alligator who swears off eating ducks. This often proves hard to resist for poor Aldo, who constantly must fight ostracization from his species and his own predatory instincts, especially in the episode where he hallucinates Bill and his friends as skinned floating ducks.

Eventually, they start karate-chopping up as much as they can for the sandwiches, and eventually chop up most of the park as well.
</li><li> In "Snooze You Lose", an insomniac Squidward goes for a walk and sees a billboard advertising beds, a homeless man sleeping on a bench, worm puppies sleeping in the window display of a pet shop, and a television showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountingSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountingSheep">sheep jumping over a fence</a>.
