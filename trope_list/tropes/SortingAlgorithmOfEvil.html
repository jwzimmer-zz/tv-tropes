<p><em>Villains will appear in strictly ascending order by menace</em>.
</p><p>This trope has ancient roots. Possibly the earliest example, at least in the English language, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a> epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em>. It just makes good sense that as our heroes fight the forces of evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">they should get better at fighting the forces of evil</a>. So as the story progresses, the fights should get easier and easier. Of course, having an overly easy fight is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">bad drama</a>, so you have to consistently increase the threat the heroes face. This results in the Sorting Algorithm of Evil. The first villain you meet is the weakest, and the last is the strongest. As the heroes get strong enough to defeat their current enemy, a new enemy will emerge that forces them to reach another skill level. It would be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a> if the hero defeated the Baddest Ass and spent the remaining time contending with not-quite-as-Bad Asses.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>There are several ways to justify this; due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterThreatExpiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterThreatExpiration">Monster Threat Expiration</a>, the current villain usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">Forgot To Level Grind</a> while the heroes are out collecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a> and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Gonna Fly Now</a> thereby outclassing him. This at least provides an in-story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">explanation</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarckian</a> evolution of evil from one bad guy to the next. In some cases the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> the heroes defeated last time was actually a mere member of a powerful organization. The others can show up to avenge their fallen comrade, so now we have the previous big bad times two or more. One of the more realistic possibilities, albeit one that's hard to justify in many stories, is a tournament structure, where the opponents become more formidable the closer the heroes get to the championship. In a series centering around military technology this can be explained by technological progress. The heroes will get new weapons, strategies, and better technology, but so will the enemy.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Occasionally, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">particularly strong</a> or evil villain will ignore this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">arrive early</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">beat the hell out of the heroes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina">only to leave them alive</a> because they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">Not Worth Killing</a>. Villains who use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">this as a tool</a> are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">Not So Harmless Villains</a>. Sometimes, rather than toss a stronger villain at the heroes the writer might decide to surprise them with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside-Context Problem</a> that uses different tactics than brute force.
</p><p>A problem comes up if a long-running show goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">past its</a> first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. We may believe that the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> is enough of a tactical dunce to think that sending his henchmen out in ascending order was a valid strategy. But why should the <em>new</em>, unrelated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> happen to be even stronger? Sometimes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> might form a string of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">Men Behind The Men</a>, making this structure more sensible. Although this leads to new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> issues: why doesn't the Man Most Behind use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">unimaginable power</a> of his position to just wipe all the heroes out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">instead of just sitting there</a>? If the first Big Bad is only a local terror, bigger bads may not have even been <em>aware</em> of the heroes. The increasing threats they face are a reflection of the threat they pose to the ultimate boss. And then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> that can rise when one wonders why later, more powerful villains would tolerate the earlier, weaker ones hatching plots of their own. If the villain of Season Three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">wants to destroy the world</a>, and the villain of Season Four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">wants to conquer it</a>, why would the Season Four villain tolerate his predecessor's attempts to destroy it? One way to address these issues is to make the later villain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> who only gets released after the earlier villain is defeated, not necessarily as a result of it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Another downside of this trope is viewers who get into a show later may find early villains lame by comparison when they go back to catch up - "Pshaw â€” we're supposed to be worried about this guy? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight">He can't even</a> blow up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat">galaxy</a>!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> can be used to soften this blow; if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> ends the season a lot lamer than he started, the next season's enemy doesn't have to actually be any stronger to give the impression of an increasing level of tension.
</p><p>This trope is particularly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Roleplay Games</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a>: the more and stronger enemies you fight, the more experience and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power</a> you get. You also get the magical weapons and armors they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">drop</a>. You have no chance against mid-game monsters with a starting character, but by the time you get to them, you are ready. That makes this the perfect trope for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero">Small Steps Hero</a>, since they can clean up the world one bad guy at a time.
</p><p>Related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientQuesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientQuesting">Convenient Questing</a> where ascending menace is laid out geographically, and the player must proceed through these regions in strictly ascending order by menace. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mount Doom?</a> It's right over there, but you have to go through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMountain">Hills of Moderate Evil</a>, which are themselves on the far side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">Forest of Inconvenience</a>, reachable via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhibliHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhibliHills">Ghibli Hills</a>.)
</p><p>When this happens involving entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">breeds/species of villains</a>, it's changing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree">Villain Pedigree</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played Straight</a> for most of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. The first major enemy Goku faces is Pilaf, who is laughably weak and incompetent. The Red Ribbon Army is more dangerous and powerful with General Blue being their strongest soldier who nearly kills Goku several times. They then hired Mercenary Tao who utterly beats Goku. After that, most of Goku's opponents were either a little weaker than Tao or a little stronger, with only Tien really pushing him. That is until King Piccolo comes, he is stronger than any enemy Goku ever faced and his final son Piccolo Jr is even stronger, closing out the original anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> starts off by giving characters an explicit numerical "Power Level". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bfk7');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bfk7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bfk7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The baseline human rating was about 10, while a very strong human fighter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts">Supernatural Martial Arts</a> would have a power of about 100. Goku's rating was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">over 9000</a>.</span> This held out until the middle of the Frieza arc, when the devices that were used to calculate these combat ratings were destroyed; at this point, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">strongest form</a> had a rating of around <em>120,000,000</em>, whereas just two months earlier the heroes had been hard-pressed to deal with an opponent nearly seven thousand times weaker (Vegeta, then at 18,000). The plot helps support the progression; Raditz arrived first, and called on a pair of stronger allies; the heroes went after their boss next; the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> was created from said boss' cells, plus those of the powered-up heroes, and so on. The final villain was a mild subversion because, while its final form was not as strong power-wise as some of the other transformations, its unique physiology made it nearly impossible to kill and its nature became far more merciless. If you go back to watch the series again, you soon realize that even the first fight was equally as tough as the last. The numerical concepts of "power levels" were quietly dropped after the Frieza Saga, since the people who used the concept were all dead. Starting from Frieza and continuing onward, each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> was the most powerful and dangerous being in the universe, even more so than the previous most powerful and dangerous being in the universe. This was justified by the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> being artificially created and not actually existing at the time Frieza was named as the most powerful, or was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">sealed away</a> so long ago that people forgot the being even existed outside of one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top Gods</a>.
<ul><li> Incidentally, Frieza, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> with 120,000,000 power level in question, was actually <em>significantly</em> more powerful than every other character even in his own arc; Goku, who defeated him, was actually several <em>million</em> points weaker, and only won because he got a power boost in the form of going Super Saiyan for the first time at the 11th hour. Prior to this boost, Frieza could easily have killed Goku and every other Z fighter whenever he wanted- that he didn't was down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondVillainStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondVillainStupidity">Bond Villain Stupidity</a> as he was irked that Goku, while leagues weaker than Frieza, was still much stronger than any Saiyan he had ever faced, and Frieza wanted to crush him with as little effort as possible out of spite.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn">Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!</a></em>, in which an alien menace arrives and is easily defeated, because it arrived a bit too late in the chronology, and everyone was so enormously powerful that it really didn't ever have a chance at all. Specifically, the two villains are noted to be as powerful as Frieza. Goku remarks that it should be a good match for the <em>kids</em>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, where the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> turned out to be pathetically weak, but had the ability to possess the bodies of the various insanely superpowered supporting characters surrounding the hero in order to increase its strength. It is later played straight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after possessing Vegeta</span> where he becomes much stronger than a Super Saiyian 3 Goku, and a Super Saiyan 4 was needed to defeat him. The next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> was Super 17, who forced Goku to go all out, and the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">Omega Shenron</a> was much stronger than Super Saiyian 4 Goku on his own. It took a fusion and an Universal Spirit Bomb to take him down, making him the strongest villain in the <em>GT</em> canon.
</li><li> Beerus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZBattleOfGods">Battle of Gods</a></em> is even higher in power than any villain in canon, being an official "God of Destruction" for his universe and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">feared by all the gods in the universe</a>. He curb stomps Super Saiyan 3 Goku without trying and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Super Saiyan God form, the strongest Super Saiyan state at that point,</span> only forced him to go to 70% of his power and Goku still lost. That's right, Goku famous for almost always winning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">was outmatched by someone who will always be better than him</a>. And the real kicker, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his assistant Whis is actually much stronger than him</span> and there are eleven other universe's Gods of Destruction who could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">stronger than Beerus</a>.
</li><li> This trope is actually played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection Â‘FÂ’</a></em>, in that the main antagonist of the movie is once again Frieza. However, this time Frieza <em>DIDN'T</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">forget to level grind</a> and instead "decided to train for the first time in his life". The results are... dramatic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> for most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>.
<ul><li> Beerus is the first enemy the Z-Fighters face and he is so far above their level that Goku is still weaker than him even after training with Whis.
</li><li> Frieza is a threat after coming back to life, training, and gaining an ultimate form that surpasses Super Saiyan Blue Goku, but he's still weaker than Beerus and would have been no threat at all if Goku and Vegeta worked together. His army is also easily defeated by the Z-Fighters who included Master Roshi and were missing several of their heavy-hitters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Buu, Android 18</a>, and Gotenks only appears for a short time.
</li><li> In the Champa Saga, while there is no villain per se, only Hit on the U6 team poses a threat to Goku and Vegeta in their god forms (3/5 of the team are comparable to their base forms, 1/5 comparable to their Super Saiyan 1 forms), and strength-wise he is at best a little above Golden Frieza. Skill-wise, however, he is far more dangerous. Champa himself may be a little weaker than Beerus, but he is still far above any of the heroes since he was ready to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murder the entire U6 team</span> despite all the power they showed and Goku is helpless to do anything about it. The next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of an anime-only arc, Copy-Vegeta, is as strong as Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta, which makes him on par with Golden Frieza and Hit in terms of pure power, but much weaker than the latter skill-wise. The manga more explicitly averts this with both the four lower tier team members (Goku mentions even Fat Buu could beat them easily, and a rusty Piccolo does fine against their third-best) and Hit (Goku states that Vegeta easily could've defeated Hit if he wasn't worn-out and surprised by Hit's Time-Skip, making Hit a lot weaker than Golden Frieza, just not in terms of skill).
</li><li> In the Future Trunks Saga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku Black</span> is stated by Future Trunks to be only as strong as Super Saiyan 3 Goku (notable in the manga version as this Goku isn't much stronger than he was in the Buu arc, meaning manga Black is only around Majin Buu's lower forms). However, Black is able to improve rapidly much like Hit, and by the time Goku and Vegeta confront him in the future he is able to go toe-to-toe with Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta. Then it's revealed that he has a Super Saiyan form, Super Saiyan RosÃ©, which he uses to overwhelm SSB Vegeta and he's <em>still</em> getting stronger. Then averted with Future Zamasu, who in the anime is at least weaker than the SSBs and in the manga is weaker than even Cell (he admits that Super Saiyan Goku is stronger than he is), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">has</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">plethora</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">abilities</a> that make him useful as support for Black. Then it gets taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> for the final four episodes of the arc where Black and Future Zamasu perform a Potara Earring Fusion to create Fused Zamasu, who delivers an effortless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks all at once, <em>all at their full power</em>, forcing <em>Vegito</em> to make a return appearance to stand a chance against him, although whether Fused Zamasu stronger than Beerus depends on the version. In the manga, he isn't since Shin states only Vegito surpasses Beerus and Vegito crushes manga Fused Zamasu effortlessly, while in the anime he is because he can match Blue Vegito blow for blow. Then it's played horrifyingly straight for the first time ever when Fused Zamasu loses his physical form and becomes Infinite Zamasu. This entails becoming either an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> with the ability to <em>consume the entire future multiverse and break time to the point where he can devour the present timeline as well</em> (anime) or an infinitely-duplicating version of Fused Zamasu with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> (manga), something that Beerus could never hope to achieve (nor desire to achieve). In both versions, <strong>nothing</strong> hurts him anymore and it takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> himself, Zeno, to end Fused Zamasu once and for all.
</li><li> In the Universal Survival Saga, none of the competitors even come close to Infinite Zamasu in terms of danger (they are not allowed to kill in tournament rules and can all be killed at least theoretically, for one), and only three of them (Agnilasa, Top, and Kale/Kefla) are clearly above SSR Black (With Top as a Destroyer and Kefla <em>maybe</em> being roughly comparable to Fused Zamasu). Only one, Jiren, clearly exceeds Fused Zamasu.
</li><li> That said, Jiren counts as another example of the trope being played straight (besides Infinite Zamasu). Whis explicitly says that he's stronger than a God of Destruction that's <em>stronger than Beerus</em> (it's implied said God is Belmod, who admits Jiren is stronger than he is). After seeing him show off a bit of power, Whis not only reaffirms what he said, but notes that Jiren may very well have surpassed the level of the Gods of Destruction in general. Beerus, in the same scene, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">absolutely terrified</a> by what he senses from Jiren's strength and wonders how <em>any</em> being could have so much power. The best part? All of that is <em>before</em> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">actually goes to full power</a>. When he does, not only is Beerus practically pissing himself, but even Whis seems a little alarmed. It's telling that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a> needed to give Goku a bit of a chance against Jiren (he would straight up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> anything else) can't be accessed willingly, even by the end of the Universe Survival arc. The narrative basically acknowledges that Goku being able to fight on par with Jiren completely throws off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedRelativeStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedRelativeStrength">Fixed Relative Strength</a> previously established that necessitates Beerus being above the heroes.
</li><li> Then came the titular antagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em>. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">fans continue to debate</a> whether Broly at full power is stronger or weaker than Jiren, official merchandise labeled him as the strongest foe faced yet, and Goku asserts his belief that he is stronger than Beerus. After all, it does require <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gogeta as a Super Saiyan Blue to beat Broly</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> carried this off by declaring that Zentradi &lt; Masters &lt; Invid. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotechTheShadowChronicles">Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles</a></em> added The Children of the Shadow to this progression. However, it's not so simple, as in terms of raw power it's Zentradi &gt; Masters &gt; Invid &gt; Children of Shadows:
<ul><li> The Zentradi are, in absolute terms, <em>the</em> strongest faction of all, having a force of <em>six million warships</em> capable of taking on <em>all</em> the other factions at once and winning. They're only defeated due a combination of their advance force of one million ships defecting (thus providing Earth with the numbers they need to take on the Zentradi), Earth's secret weapon depleting their forces even further and the Zentradi having an unexpected weakness, and even then they casually decimate Earth;
</li><li> The Robotech Masters, creators of the Zentradi, have the most advanced technology of all factions, but lack the sheer numbers of their minions and can't make the most of their advanced technology due a lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin">Protoculture</a>. This allows the defenders of Earth (whose technology has advanced in the meantime and whose weapons don't suffer from Protoculture depletion) to score a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>;
</li><li> When they arrive on Earth the Invid are at their weakest: they too suffer from Protoculture depletion, and their might suffers even more due only half their race arriving on Earth (the other half is busy attacking the Robotech Masters' former empire, getting destroyed by the Robotech Expeditionary Force in the process). However the defenders of Earth are too weakened by the battle against the Masters to stop them, and by the time the Robotech Expeditionary Force has rebuilt their own forces and returns the Invid have used the Protoculture on Earth to rebuild their own forces;
</li><li> The Children of Shadows are weaker than the rebuilt Invid, and are a danger only due them having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">supplied the Robotech Expeditionary Force with boobytrapped technology</span> and the Invid having left with all the Protoculture on Earth and the means to produce more, plus the SDF-3 disappearing with the only other mean to produce Protoculture.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> presented villains not only in ascending order by menace, but also, for some reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">effeminateness</a>. For instance, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in season 1 of <em>GX</em> was a withered old man; Season 2's villain was a younger, more strapping adult male. Season 3 had a Hermaphrodite Duel Monster. The effeminateness of the villain ties directly into their personal interest towards the hero. At first, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is usually just interested in a certain trinket or item carried by the protagonist, while the next is usually more interested in the protagonist's actual abilities and strengths. The biggest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> <em>always</em> seemed to have some kind of intimate interpersonal relationship with the hero, which would border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> (since both sides in this series were invariably male), if only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> wasn't trying to enslave/murder them for some deep, scarring betrayal they blame on the protagonist. There are only two exceptions: Dartz, in the Doma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Capsule Monsters arc, which, as far as the rest of the series is concerned, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">never even happened</a>. Even the original series (never released beyond Japan and taking place before the anime we all know and love) has most of the villains being random thugs met in chance encounters, fitting into the algorithm perfectly.
<ul><li> This is played straight throughout the continuum of all three series so far, the first villains were merely bullies that wanted to abuse their authority, then came Seto Kaiba who was willing to kill the protagonists as well as being a very high-ranking member of the corporate world. Then came Shadi and Dark Bakura, both with magical powers, with the latter being far more malign and able to alter reality, then came Pegasus who was a more personal threat with Pegasus who wanted the Puzzle to revive his dead lover, and a much longer arc. Marik arrives and really raises the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> with far more deadlier stakes involved and more personal past to the Pharaoh. Once his dark side is revealed, it's either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">watching the world fall to ruin</a> depending on which dub you watch. The biggest threats outside of Sieg who merely wanted to best Seto, were Dartz and Zorc, the who was being summoned by Dark Bakura]], with the former being even more dangerous as his ambitions to destroy humanity involving a dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> needed offerings from two worlds with life forms, while the latter wanted merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>. GX comes around and while Kagemaru merely wanted youth, Saitou, or rather the Light Of Destruction, wanted universal dominance and was kind of responsible for everything in the series, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Darkness' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a></span> was threatening, it was not on the same scale. 5Ds introduces <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Z-ONE</span> who is implied to have complete control of the space/time continuum and finally Zexal has Dr. Faker with the implied goal of destroying other dimensions.
</li><li> This is also played straight in regard to the villain's ace monsters, each of which is more powerful or at least more visually impressive (to invoke this trope) than the last. To recap:
<ul><li> Kaiba was the first Villain, and his ace monster was the "Blue Eyes White Dragon", a 3000 ATK beatstick. In the early days, where players had 2000 Life points, monsters also didn't require tributes and card effects weren't as common, that's all it needed to be a major threat. It sure didn't help Kaiba had three of them.
</li><li> Pegasus, the second main Villain, had " Blue Eyes Toon Dragon", a more difficult to destroy version of Kaiba's ace, and once his toons no longer sufficed he brings out "Reliquished" and it's upgraded counterpart "Thousand Eyes Restrict", which have 0 ATK and DEF but horribly broken effects that allow them to possess Yugi's monsters and negate their own destruction.
</li><li> During the first Virtual World Arc, the Big Five's Ace monster was "Five-Headed Dragon", a 5000 point beatstick that couldn't be destroyed by anything other than Light monsters. The shows 4 premier examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons">Instant Awesome: Just Add Dragons!</a> cannot defeat it, forcing Kaiba and Yugi to fuse their Ace cards together.
</li><li> During the second Virtual World Arc, Gozaburo Kaiba's Ace card was Exodia Necross, a zombified counterpart to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>. It started off with a respectable 1800 ATK, could not be affected by card effects, could not be destroyed by battle, and gained 1000 ATK and DEF each turn. By the time Kaiba had figured out it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a>, it already had 5800 ATK, at the time the highest value any villain monster had achieved.
</li><li> Meanwhile, the Big Five and Noah from the same arc have respectable aces of their own:
</li><li> The Big Five bring back Five-Headed Dragon for their combined duel with Yugi and Joey, and when they manage to destroy it, they summon Berserk Dragon to replace it, which isn't as powerful as Five-Headed Dragon, but is still a sizable threat with 3500 ATK and the ability to attack <em>four times</em> a turn (though it loses ATK after every turn), not to mention that beating Five-Headed Dragon put Yugi and Yoey into a vulnerable position and they can't use the same monster they used to destroy the Five-Headed Dragon.
</li><li> Noah's deckmaster Shinato's Arc can summon monsters that were previously destroyed for every monster his opponent has or use them to recover his life points by a huge amount. And if it somehow gets destroyed, he can summon the even more powerful Shinato, King of a Higher Plane, which has 3300 ATK, cuts his opponent's life points in half every time it destroys a defense position monster and gives the lost life points to him, and can remove itself from the playing field if it would get destroyed (which would make him lose due to the rules they were using), meaning that the opponent has to settle for winning the normal way by depleting the <em>thousands</em> of life points he's accumulated.
</li><li> During the Battle City Finals arc, and by extension the entire Battle City arc (which was interrupted by the second Virtual World Arc), Yami Marik is the main Villain and his Ace monster is the "Winged Dragon of Ra", the strongest of the Egyptian Gods. If that description would not suffice, bear in mind that it is the shows premier offender of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a>.
</li><li> the next villain, Dartz, upped the ante even further with "Orichalcos Shunoros" which, because of the method it was summoned, had a whopping 20000 ATK points., although it lost ATK whenever it battled a monster. And then there is his "Divine Serpent Geh", which has INFINITE ATK points, but had no immunity to card effects, a powerful restricting effect, and would cause Dartz to automatically lose should it be destroyed. And then there was the Great Leviathan, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, rather than a Duel Monster, so powerful the Egyptian Gods had to gang up on it outside the card game, and even then only barely won.
</li><li> The same goes for the next and final villain, Zorc Necrophades. He too was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> rather than a playing card, and succesfully defeated the three Egyptian Gods (which not even The Great Leviathan could do) to start his rampage, and then went on to defeat Exodia and the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon/Dragon Master Knight without any issue.
</li><li> The KC Grand Prix anime filler arc (which comes between Dartz and Zorc) plays with this with Zigfried and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leon</span>:
</li><li> Zigfried, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, has a powerful One-Turn Kill combo, but if that fails, it leaves him vulnerable, and all he can really do is stall until he can get an offense going again. However, he's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker">expert hacker</a>, which he uses to mess with Kaiba, his company, and his tournament.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leon</span>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, is a competent duelist with a deck filled with monsters with tricky effects. In addition, Ziegfried provides him with an illegal card that he hacked to be both playable and loaded with overpowered effects. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayVillain">Fair-Play Villain</a>, and wanted no part in cheating, and would have thrown the match if it weren't for said overpowered effects preventing him from doing so, the card triggering a virus in Kaibacorp's systems, and Yugi's insistence to continue the duel anyway.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The opposition on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> also sorted itself out into ascending levels of power per season, starting with the Dark Kingdom (which could only field a single youma at a time) all the way up to Galaxia, who threatened the entire universe. The only exceptions seem to be Ail and En who, regardless of probably being weaker than the last villains, had to face senshi with unusually strong attacks. Naturally this filler was forgotten later. It also seems to have been the original M.O. of the Amazon Trio, explaining their penchant for disguising themselves; likewise, there aren't real arc villains either. The strange thing is that the five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> of the villain groups (Queen Metaria, Death Phantom, Pharaoh 90, Queen Nehellenia, and Chaos) are all portrayed as having the same dark power to destroy or conquer the universe which would mean they were at the same level of power. In the manga, it's because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're all the same villain being reincarnated over and over again</span>.
<ul><li> Averted, in the final arc of the manga: the first opponent they meet is <em>Galaxia herself</em>, and the only reason she retreats and sends in her minions is that she needs Sailor Moon strong enough to match her and they'll be a good training while also serving to take out her allies, and she's more than willing to step back in if necessary for the latter job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, set before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> and telling the story of Sailor Venus before she became part of the group appropriately has a big bad who though a threat to Sailor V is an extreme small fry in the scheme of things. He's one step below the first arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> being an underling of Kunzite. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em> debuted before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> but wrapped up shortly after.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> initially averts the algorithm by including fights between characters much stronger than the main heroes throughout the first part of the series. The first major enemy, Zabuza, is so strong that the Genin can't be expected to hold their own against him (even his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>, Haku, is too much for them). In addition, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Orochimaru, shows up in the <em>second</em> major arc, and for the longest time, even the strongest characters could, at best, manage a tie against him. However, this trope shows up more and more as the heroes gain strength until they're able to hang with the big boys on their own, and once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orochimaru is defeated, we are introduced to a number of major villains who are even stronger than him</span>. Granted, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the later antagonists is an internal one with more of a threat for his political influence than his physical power, and a number of major villains meet their defeats for reasons other than the heroes being stronger (Orochimaru himself was at his weakest when he was taken out)</span>, but even then, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when a number of previous antagonists are resurrected during the Shinobi World War arc, most of them fall victim to this trope (with Nagato being the main exception).</span> The trope plays out this way mostly because in part 1, the main characters are fresh out of ninja school and there are several more powerful adult shinobi around; as the heroes catch up to their elders after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, this trope shows up more and more.
</li><li> Largely averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter Ã— Hunter</a></em>. A notable secondary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">sometimes-friend-sometimes-foe</a> character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Hisoka the Magician</a> is introduced as one of the most dangerous men alive. Nearly three hundred chapters later (after a long hiatus), he's still one of the most dangerous men alive. The various enemies that the lead characters meet fluctuate wildly between "can kill them with a sneeze" to "wotta wimp!", with no real bearing on what point of the story they're at chronologically.
<ul><li> Also subverted with the Chimera Ant arc, while Phantom Troupe and the Greed Island enemies were strong threats, the Chimera Ants are very jagged in ranking, some were very weak and others are much stronger than even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, their king <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> prior to his death</span> was the strongest character thus far.
</li></ul></li><li> Seems to actually be part of the dungeon ecosystem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, with powerful mid-level bosses preventing deep-level boss monsters from forcing lesser species further up and overrunning the easier levels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, this is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>. The goal of the series is to reach a geographical destination that has been known but not yet reached for over 20 years, so a lot of pirates have gathered around it. Naturally, the strongest are the ones who have gotten the closest.
<ul><li> As Luffy and crew get further along the Grand Line, they discover tougher opponents. The series isn't above throwing the odd curveball though, like Mihawk first appearing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">dominating</a> Zoro very early in the series, and Bellamy showing up and going down like a punk after the defeat of Crocodile. In contrast to major arc villains, Eneru is a bit of a subversion in that he is the most powerful and dangerous opponent Luffy has actually defeated, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lightning powers</a> giving him enough power to destroy entire islands and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">but</a> the one thing that could make all of that power completely useless was being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a>, which Luffy is. Later on in the show's run, the Sabaody arc started with the Straw Hats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">dominating</a> some lame pirates, then introduces nine pirate crews, some equal to the Straw Hats. It ends with the Straw Hats completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">dominated again</a> by some of the strongest characters introduced in One Piece up until now.
</li><li> Subverted with the Marineford arc, with numerous high level Marines and pirates that are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">too strong for Luffy</a>. These include the Seven Warlords of the Sea like Doflamingo and Mihawk to the three Admirals and from the Vice Admirals to Sengoku. It's going to take time for the Straw Hats to overcome these opponents.
</li><li> Also subverted by the Four Emperors. The first one we see is none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Shanks</a>, followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">Whitebeard</a>. Then we hear about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">what Kaido did</a> to Moria's old crew. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">the first thing we see Big Mom do</a> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eat one of her crewmates for no reason whatsoever and decimating islands for not giving her sweets</span>.
</li><li> It is played with, however, as each emperor to be shown on screen has been more evil than the last, going from Shanks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>), to Whitebeard (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>) to Blackbeard (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> to an extent), to Big Mom (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, but also somewhat tragic), to Kaido (no redeeming qualities whatsoever). Bounty-wise, Blackbeard has the lowest, followed by Shanks, Big Mom, Kaido, and then Whitebeard. However, Roger had a higher bounty than all of them when he was alive, which is also the highest bounty for a pirate in recorded history.
</li><li> Subverted with the Seven Warlords as well, as far as the original group goes. The first member introduced is the aforementioned Mihawk, and he is arguably the strongest member. He was followed by Crocodile, Doflamingo, and Kuma, who all prove to be heavy-hitters in their own right and of whom only Crocodile was beatable to the pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> Straw Hats. Then came Moria, who was surprisingly weak (relatively speaking; he still proved to be a huge thorn in the Straw Hats' sides). The last two Warlords introduced were Hancock and Jinbe, who, while not <em>quite</em> as powerful as the first four, were stronger than Moria, and were by far the most moral members. They both ended up allying with Luffy (Hancock as a result of falling in love with him, Jinbe due to his prior friendship with Luffy's brother Ace), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Jinbe officially joining his crew during the Whole Cake Island arc</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight through the first three major story arcs (Substitute Shinigami, Soul Society, and Arrancar).
<ul><li> In Substitute Shinigami, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monsters Of The Week</a> start out as ordinary, non-sentient Hollows but steadily grow more powerful and cunning, culminating in the Gillian Menos Grande at the end of Ishida's introduction story.
</li><li> Ichigo's near-instantaneous defeat by Byakuya in the prelude to the Soul Society arc shows that the Shinigami up the ante as antagonists. On their way to rescue Rukia, Ichigo and Company fight their way up through the Gotei 13 hierarchy, from seated officers to captains with released bankai.
</li><li> Once again, the increased threat level is indicated by Ichigo being handily defeated by Ulquiorra and Yammy's scouting party at the beginning of the Arrancar arc. When the battle begins in earnest, the Arrancar attack the protagonists in line with their power levels: Fraccion first, then Privaron Espada, then up through the ranked Espada, then finally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a> Gin and Tousen, then (after 5 LONG years of publication time) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Aizen himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the Fullbringer Arc. Tsukishima and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ginjou</span> are far less powerful than Aizen or even the Arrancar (on the level of Ichigo's early Soul Society Arc opponents) but make up for it by being much more manipulative at a time when Ichigo is especially ill-equipped to deal with their mindgames.
</li><li> <em>Consciously</em> subverted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">Vandenreich</a> in the Thousand Year Blood War Arc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Yhwach</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> who uses a Blitzkrieg strategy true to his Nazi motif, by sending his most powerful fighters in first to steamroller the Shinigami and using the rank-and-file to mop up after them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> is complex: Pixie is the first of the Big Bad 4, but stronger than Gali and Greywolf â€” it takes the entire team <em>sans</em> Golem to beat Pixie, but only Moochi or Tiger to beat Gali and Greywolf. Then they meet Moo (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>) on the road quite early, and the encounter plays out like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>. Although it's played straight in a sense, since Naga is the strongest of the Big Bad 4, and after that it's Moo in his Dragon Body who is incredibly powerful. But is subverted again, because in the next series they're up against one of his captains, who is obviously much weaker than Moo was.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>. The characters make a point of stating several times that the villain of the third arc, Enishi, while very powerful, is just not on the same level as the villain of the previous arc, Shishio. Enishi manages to make up the difference by striking while everyone's still recovering from the fight with Shishio, sending several of his henchmen to fight the heroes, using a style that seems specifically built to counter Kenshin's own, and fighting an extremely emotionally distraught Kenshin. In short, while Shishio would probably defeat Enishi, Enishi is in a much better position to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kenshin</a>.
<ul><li> Plus, some of the enemies are not as big of a threat; Inui Banjin gives Sanosuke a hard time, but once he's able to use Futae no Kiwami the battle ends rather promptly. This is contrasted with Anji, who traded blows with Sano despite the technique supposedly being a one hit kill.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> this, since the Akuma all have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">specific Levels</a>... except that, as the heroes get stronger, they start fighting higher-leveled Akuma in larger groups. Partially justified as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was relatively inactive in the beginning, and they only appear in large groups when he gathers them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, every villain is billed as the most powerful, strongest, blah blah blah. This begins with several D-Class Demons early on and ends with the heroes fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">S-Class demons</a> at the end of the series. Somewhat justified in that the Spirit World set up a powerful barrier that prevented powerful demons from entering the living world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em> inverts this with its seasonal big bads. The first series has Homura, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">God of War</a>. <em>Reload</em> has Dr. Nii's disciple Kami-sama, and <em>Gunlock</em> features Hazel, a mere priest from the west. It also plays with the trope by making the villains harder to defeat in other ways - Homura was unquestionably a bad guy, but is followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> Kami-sama, who just didn't work on the same level mentally. Then there was Hazel, who was in all appearances a good guy, creating a huge ethical backlash to fighting him.
</li><li> The classic example of the technology creep variety would be the Zeon mobile suits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>. They go from the rather pathetic Zaku which was designed for fighting conventional vehicles rather than other mobile suits, to the fast, heavily armed and armored, though somewhat unwieldy Dom to the powerful and agile Gelgoog, which nearly matches the Gundam's performance, with a few Ace customs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototypes</a> along the way for flavor. This would be a fairly realistic setup... if the war had lasted longer than a <em>single year</em>. The novelization is somewhat better about this as the war drags on for two years and the Gelgoogs never show up. It also subverts this trope, as the antagonists use a slightly less advanced Mobile Armor to fight the Gundam in the climactic battle due to supply shortages and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though the Gundam defeats it, it proves to be enough of a distraction that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a> piloting a lowly Rick Dom is able to finish Amuro off</span>.
</li><li> The entirety of battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> is a combination of this and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Anti-Spiral</a> actually does explain, though, that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">intentionally did it that way</a>, the reasoning being that the harder the heroes have worked to get to where they are, the more crushing it'll be when they're finally defeated. That's, uh... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">not what happens</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> uses a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>: Baby, In-Training, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate, Mega. The team has to advance to the next level to face the next level of enemies. This gets a little ridiculous in later series, where every bad guy seems to be Mega level and some are just that much more powerful then other Megas.
<ul><li> Initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayedtrope">downplayed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01">Digimon V-Tamer 01</a></em> where the enemies went from adult/champion to perfect/ultimate to the then final level but it was explained partially by enemy and ally alike continuing to evolve while the protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">were not</a> and the big bad Demon had not gotten personally involved because he was winning. <em>Then</em> it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">went a step further</a> and introduced Arkadimon, which was the "Super Ultimate" Digimon, a whole new level entirely. Among other things, it killed Sigma's Piedmon (a Mega level) while still at in-training level. In one hit. Its Champion level did the same to Seraphimon (a considerably stronger Mega) with about as much effort. In fairness to the Piedmon, he was already injured but until that point it was established in V-Tamer that a difference of more than one level was an insurmountable hurdle.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> has Devimon, an evil Champion-level Digimon. Then there was Etemon, who was purely comical as opposed to the serious Devimon, but was at the Ultimate level and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">considerably stronger</a>. Then came Myotismon, an Ultimate of great strength who was the first Digimon in the show to evolve to Mega form. Then came the four Dark Masters, who were all Mega level. The last, most powerful enemy they faced, was Apocalymon, an insanely-strong Mega level, who beat the digidestined at first, but was defeated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>. Explained by the Dark Masters: they were heading up a mountain, through each of the Dark Masters' turfs one at a time and the Dark Masters rarely interfered in one another's matters. The four got progressively tougher the further up the mountain they got, the most powerful Piedmon reigning from the very top.
</li><li> Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>, the first several Digimon to appear are all Rookie or Champion level, and are easily beaten by the Rookie level Digimon used by the protagonists, that quite quickly unlock Champion level. Later, the Devas appear and nearly force them to unlock Ultimate level, after which they wind up in the Digital World and learn of the D-Reaper, which eventually results in the good guys unlocking Biomerge Digivolution. In the end, it all came down to 4 Megas against one Mega. Guess who kicked ass for most of the fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> averts this, in that the first major "villain" they encounter is of the Mega level. Then, however, it turns out that he's not actually a bad guy, and the main antagonist becomes <em>Gotsumon</em> (a Rookie level digimon), the human-hating minion of the aforementioned bad guy. He ends up manipulating another Mega level digimon into attacking the humans, and then it's revealed that everything bad and the reason why Digimon distrust humans is due to the actions of Dr. Akihiro Kurata - a <em>human.</em> Later, it appears that Kurata is going to be usurped by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Belphemon</span>, Kurata instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fuses with it and remains in control of it until his defeat.</span> Yggdrasil rounds out the series as the penultimate antagonist, but considering his actions are due to Kurata's own misdeeds, Kurata still remains the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">main villain</a> of the series.

The first enemy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> faces, Alcyone, is a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Ice Mage</a> but easily dispatched. Then come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Ascot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Caldina</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Lafarga</a> and, <em>finally</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Zagato himself</a>. While their power levels are all over the place, they have specific skills that make them increasingly dangerous, and it would have been easy for any of the later foes to eliminate the Knights had they been dispatched earlier. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">one wonders why</a>, since Zagato knew all about the Magic Knight legend, why he didn't go after the girls himself as soon as they arrived. In the anime, Zagato does show up for a few moments to show the heroes just a tiny portion of his power. Had he actually attacked them, they would not have survived. What Zagato wants to do <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Other than keeping his beloved Princess alive</span> is never fully explained. He may not intend to kill the Magic Knights, regardless of what that will mean for him. The Ascot arc shows the trope in miniature: the first few "friends" are indeed strong enough to squish the Magic Knights into paste, but they have glaring weaknesses that the girls discover and exploit within minutes. However, his very last Summoned Monsters are titanic foes that can go toe-to-toe with the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Rune Gods</a>, and continue to be powerful presences in the second arc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">whenever the Knights need rescuing</a>. He always had access to them, so why he didn't call these right off the bat is a mystery to everyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. Lelouch faces off with increasingly improving resistance from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, but manages to cope because his allies also get better mechas over time. In the first major battle, he faces inept commander Prince Clovis and a bunch of regular Knightmares with his terrorist allies using mostly outdated Knightmares of their own, and they own the field... And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Suzaku</a> shows up... Algorithm leaps somewhat later when Lelouch tries to do this again against much better leader Princess Cornelia, and his (different group) allies are slaughtered. He later however turns the tables when he tries this again, only using the environment to his advantage, supported by the JLF, and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> Kallen in a better mecha. He nearly has Cornelia beat... And then Suzaku shows up... again. Eventually his allies begin to power up faster than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, and he's likely have won the war, if not for some extreme circumstances and misfortunes. Eventually Kallen's able to easily <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turn Suzaku's mech to scrap, even after it gets an upgrade.</span> By the end of the series however, his terrorist army has gotten <em>so</em> good, that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he's forced to fight them, this time commanding the forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>,</span> he's no match. Unfortunately the trope is subverted in R2, where Lelouch deals with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the immortal</span> V.V. (the target of his vendetta), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat">Schneizel</a> when everyone thought it was going to be the other way around. Even worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills V.V. before Lelouch even learns that V.V. was the one who killed his mother.</span>
</li><li> Played straight then subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi</a></em>, in the manga at least. The storyline covered in the anime plays it straight, with Kenichi fighting stronger opponents as his skill improves; high school bullies, Ragnarok mooks, the Eight Fists of Ragnarok, and finally their leader Odin. Kenichi's struggle against YOMI, the next antagonist group subverts it. YOMI's leader Sho Kanou, touted as the strongest fighter of them all and inheritor of the styles of YAMI the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> organization... is the <em>second</em> YOMI member Kenichi defeats. However Kenichi then gets his ass handed to him against another member of YOMI. Possibly justified since each of the YOMI members and their masters in YAMI believes that he or she is really the strongest; some of the YAMI members believed that Sho was unsuitable to be YOMI leader. That and Kenichi's fighting ability is highly dependent on the circumstances involved; even though he's practically superhuman at this point he's <em>still</em> slightly intimidated by high school bullies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> and other such sports manga tend to increase in scope as the story goes on. Athletes face opponents from other cities first and other countries later. Played straight <em>and</em> subverted earlier in the manga, where the Devil Bats' first opponents are a very weak team, followed immediately by the uber-talented and powerful Ojou White Knights, then the moderately challenging but not all that Zokugaku Chameleons. But, naturally, once they get to the fall tournament, the easy games all happen first. It is a knock-out tourney so only the best get far. Subverted again in the Kanto tournament, where the match-ups are decided through a lottery. They do not go against the nine-times-in-a-row-champions Shinryuuji Naga in the finals, or in the semi-finals, but in their <em>very first match</em>. They then face their ultimate rivals, the White Knights in their second match, and fellow darkhorse team, the Hakushuu Dinosaurs in the final. All are very close, very tough matches, and which one was the best is a matter of debate among the fandom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> both plays this trope straight and averts it. While the enemies fought in each series grow stronger the closer that you get to the end, the fact that each volume stars a different hero means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> don't necessarily have to be stronger than what came before. For example, while Dio Brando of Part 3 was quite dangerous, he wasn't as immediate a threat to the world as the Pillar Men of Part 2.
<ul><li> This is arguable considering what his true master plan was revealed to be in part 6, which is to make a Perfect World for Dio. And although orchestrated by one of his minions and the Part 6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Enrico Pucci, it was still a large threat either on par or greater than the Pillar Men. Especially since the Perfect World would not only have to remove the Joestar family, which are Dio's biggest threat, but also anyone who would ever pose a threat to Dio, including the Pillar Men and the Part 5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Diavolo.
</li><li> Given that above point, the only time it's really been subverted (without getting into technicalities) is with Yoshikage Kira from Part 4. Although to be fair Part 4 is about simply protecting one town over protecting the world. He was merely one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> as opposed to a vampire or a mob boss.
<ul><li> While Kira most certainly did not have as much ambition or ressources as any of the other Big Bads, he won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> so handily that he was just as hard to beat as he should given his place in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in-between Part 1 and 2. In Part 1, vampire Dio was the big threat of the series, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampire zombies</a> serving as the series' mooks. Come Part 2, vampire zombies have disappeared and vampires are downgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> status to make way for the Pillar Men. It helps that Jonathan, the first JoJo, had to learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Hamon</a> to stand a chance against Dio, while his grandson Joseph, the second JoJo, was apparently born with the skills to use Hamon and his arc was learning to control it better.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>: By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority">Law of Chromatic Superiority</a>, the heroes must first battle their peers, the Bronze Saints (and, later, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> Black Saints) in a local skirmish for the Gold Cloth; then, the Silver Saints, who hunt them down for said Cloth; and finally, the Gold Saints, who never leave the Sanctuary. Then come the Asgardian God Warriors, who can give Golds a run for their money; Marine Shoguns, likewise; and then Hades' Spectres. The last foes they encounter are actual Gods, and the teaser movie for Chapter of Heaven hints that the Bronze Boys are raring to take on the Olympian Gods themselves. Subverted in the manga when Gold Saint Virgo Shaka seeks out and nearly kills Bronze Saint Phoenix Ikki before the actual plot even begins. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">battle, such as it is,</a> is shown as an extended flashback.
<ul><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> for Seiya: the first foe he fights is Cassios, a candidate Bronze Saint, but the second is Shaina, <em>the strongest and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">sadistic</a> Silver Saint available</em>, and he only survives because, following the code, she had left behind her Cloth as it was a personal matter, and thus wasn't sure of winning once he managed to make use of his (plus other personal reasons); in the anime Seiya has another run-in with her before the Silver Saints are deployed and, as this time she's on official business and thus is wearing her Cloth, she almost <em>kills him</em>; and when the Silver Saints are deployed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis">the first one to come out is almost as strong as Shaina and much saner</a>, and give Seiya the hardest non-Shaina fight until the Gold Saints.
</li><li> Averted in its prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas">Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas</a></em>. The difficulty of the enemies varies ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">simply strong Specters</a>, the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Judges</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Thanatos/Hypnos</a>, but a good deal of energy is put forth into defeating Thanatos/Hypnos before even finishing off the Judges; and many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">rankless strong Specters</a> actually served as obstacles for the last arc, outlasting both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">the Dragons</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-bosses</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, where the first major antagonist that Negi faced -Evangeline - is the strongest character in the series, only winning the fight by a combination of luck and the fact that Eva wasn't really taking the fight seriously/more or less let him win. Played with because part of Eva's curse was still in effect, and when he first fights her without it, he can barely last three minutes.
</li><li> This trope is straight out mocked in the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaruhiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaruhiChan">Haruhi-chan</a></em>. After being 'defeated', Asakura warns Kyon and Yuki that she is "the weakest of the radical four", which will now come after them. And above the radical four, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">the top three leaders</a>..!
</li><li> Played straight for most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>. Shin, Ken's initial rival and the man who engraved the seven scars on his chest, isn't even the strongest of the Nanto Seiken masters, but rather Souther, a character who is introduced a bit later and is shown to be immune to the effects of Ken's martial art at first. Jagi, the first of Ken's adoptive brothers to appear in the story, is a petty thug who never truly mastered Hokuto Shinken, but is still stronger than the average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mook</a>, in contrast to Raoh, the eldest and the last one to appear, who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for most of the first series and ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">killing most of Ken's allies</a>. Then there's Kaioh, the ultimate Big Bad of the second series, who was the only villain that was actually immune to Kenshiro's ultimate technique of Musou Tensei and almost killed him during their first encounter. Subverted in the final chapters of the manga, in which the final villain, Bolge, was just an average wasteland thug far weaker than Shin or Jagi, and was only a threat due Kenshiro having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lost his memories and fighting abilities</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>, the series begins with the main characters fighting off animal- and plant-type homunculi. Then comes along a stronger animal-type homunculus, and then the humanoid homunculi, and then Victor, and then Victor AND the Alchemist Army, and then Victor in his third stage...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UchuuSenkanYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UchuuSenkanYamato">Star Blazers / Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>. Initially, Dessler does not consider the Star Force a serious threat, and orders low-ranking shlubs Ganz and Bane to fight them. After Ganz and Bane's defeat, Dessler takes the threat more seriously and sends his best general, Lysis to fight them. After they defeat Lysis, <em>then</em> Dessler decides to take them on personally.
<ul><li> In the second season, first the Star Force fights some weak Comet Empire lackeys while Dessler's hanging out at the Comet Empire, then they fight Desslok who almost defeats them but is tricked to run away, then a tank battalion that almost destroys the Space Marines, then they fight Desslok again except this time he's ENRAGED, then they take on the Comet Empire, then the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dreadnought inside the Comet Empire</span>.
</li><li> In the third season, Dessler's buddy-buddy with the Star Force. His generals do not understand this and keep throwing more and more power to capture the Star Force without telling him. He is not amused when he finds out.
</li></ul></li><li> While threat level varies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> the threat and strength of the more serious villains does increase each time, with lesser villains thrown in between them. This is mostly managed by the characters getting by on strategy, nakama power, of in some cases temporary power ups rather than non-stop training.
<ul><li> Threats thus far are a ordinary dark guild wielding a fairly weak soul sucking demon, a rival turned evil who is on par with one of the main characters and wanted to unseal a similar demon, a rival guild who's master is on par with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> who was trying to put Fairy Tail out of business, An old friend turned evil who was on par with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> and wanted to revive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Zeref</a> (this is when all threats start to guarantee death), One of the larger dark guilds who wanted to start a guild war, a foreign king who had no powers beyond a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> who was willing to kill the guild for their magic, then a former guild member and his new, serious dark guild who easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">CurbStomped</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> and were trying to create a world where only 10% of the population could survive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then there's also the Black Dragon of the Apocalypse who the entire main and supporting cast can't put a scratch on and only leaves once it assumes they're dead.</span> The most recent arc seems to be toning it back down with a government official who only wants one guild member, supposedly for the sake of the country at the cost of her life, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except it turns out that was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> and the true threat is one of the current dragonslayers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass">from the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">future</a> with seven dragons that can curbstomp most of the mages at the place, and even the dragonslayers are hard-pressed to hurt them</span>. It gets toned back down when the next arc involves at worst a fairly average demon and another rival turned evil (though she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">pretty nasty</a> even before that), but it sets up the events for the final dark guild filled with genocidal demons who want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">erase all the magic in the continent</a>, all for the purpose of reviving their leader, who, from the words and actions of other characters in the know, is a demon on par with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the previously-mentioned Black Dragon</span>. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 2nd </span> Time-Skip also has format to it's villains. Orochi's Fin is only a problem for it's rival guild Lamia Scale as Natsu with his off-screen training takes down it's legions of monsters with ease. A black magic cult Avatar seems to be just as weak until Natsu sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Gray Fullbuster</a> working with the cult until it's revealed to be a ploy to expose Avatar. </span> An entire country that wants to invade Ishgar for the Lumen Histoire, has a Praetorian Guard with members on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">God Serena</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, who defected for unknown reasons</span> and is led by some dude named Spriggan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is another name for Zeref</span>, and finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the previously mentioned Black Dragon who is opposed to <em>everyone else</em> and wants to kill all the remaining dragon slayers</span>.
</li><li> It gets played straight with the Balam Alliance, though. You first have Oracion Seis as the weakest with both the fewest members and the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">sympathetic villains</a> aside from their Guild Master, then Grimoire Heart which is led by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> 's mentor, and finally, Tartaros, a completely genocidal guild comprised entirely of Zeref's demons and led by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the very same and previously mentioned demon that once gave <em>Igneel</em> a hard ass-kicking. Keep in mind that non-Dragon Slaying magic does jack squat against dragons in the series.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>. Many of the earlier rivals are good enough to keep up with Seigaku throughout the manga. Fudomine and Yamabuki, who are faced in the District and Prefectural Tournament respectively on, make it all the way to the nationals. Seigaku's arch rival Hyotei is faced in the very first Kanto Tournament Match. However, they prove to be Seigaku's strongest opponents after Rikkai and get faced again. Later opponents such as Shitenhouji have good players, but are defeated relatively easily compared to the "two loss three win" formula against Hyotei and Rikkaidai.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan</a></em> plays this straight.
<ul><li> S1: Naga, an egomaniac Bakugan whose plot is to absorb the power of the core of the Bakugan homeworld and conquer the universe.
</li><li> S2: King Zenoheld and the Vexos. Zenoheld rules a planet and finally goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroy the universe</a>, creating a Bakugan actually capable of doing so. Despite being strong enough to beat Naga, they've got to get a few upgrades to be able to beat them.
</li><li> S3: Emperor Barodius and the Gundalians. Are already on the winning side of a war with a peaceful planet and decides to invade Earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">for kicks</a>. Once again, the power that was able to defeat Zenoheld isn't enough to beat his forces and more upgrades are needed.

The next major enemy Lina fights (in the anime) is a creature that's IMMUNE to magic attacks and has to be taken down in a rather unusual way. The next season has the Demon God's underlings show up and be enemies. Surely they can't be as powerful, right? Wrong.

Season 4 had the same immune to magic enemy from season 1, though this one had no human controlling him, thus was actually stronger.

</li><li> Eobard Thawne/Professor Zoom was not only just as fast as Barry Allen, but he learned how to gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">Me's a Crowd</a> abilities from his speed.
</li><li> Rather than being a traditional speedster, Hunter Zolomon/Zoom had the power to slow down time. Even Wally Wast, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">fastest of the Flashes,</a> had a hard time stopping him.
</li><li> Thaddeus Thawne is not only a powerful speedster, but he stole Zoom's powers for himself and he has complete control over the individual timelines of other people.

Afterwards, though, this trope is zig-zagged and subverted since, while Batman does deal with global, even genocidal villains as his career moves on, and as part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica">Justice League</a></em> takes on intergalactic menaces and otherworldly threats, those same supervillains still pose as much or even more trouble for him as they ever have, though under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> there was / is a tendency to make the city-based threats part of larger international conspiracies, to the point where prior to the lastest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> Batman had decided to start his own multinational crimefighting <em>franchise</em> to tackle <em>crime everywhere</em>.

All three of them were defeated by Spider-Girl early in the first series, and don't reappear for several years real-time. When they finally reappear, they've been drafted to serve in a government super-team, but do a pretty poor job of it. While they were credible threats to Spider-Girl early in her career, their ineffectiveness is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by everyone from Carnage to Agent Maria Hill of S.H.I.E.L.D. to Spider-Girl herself.

They faced the genetically enhanced Atlantean Tyrak (who had superhuman strength), the robot Ultron (who was equipped with an "encephalo-ray" which could place his enemies in a death-like state and possessed an indestructible adamantium body), the mad scientist Graviton (who had the ability to control one of the fundamental forces of the universe), Count Nefaria (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a>), and eventually Korvac (a would-be warlord from the 31st century who had obtained godlike powers by absorbing part of the Power Cosmic from Galactus's abandoned starship). The first four typically took down Thor and Wonder Man (the strongest members of the team) with a single attack, while Korvac actually managed to kill the entire team in battle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before being driven to despair by the apparent betrayal of his similarly cosmically-empowered wife and restoring the team to life with his final breath</span>.

The fourth story arc has a more dangerous villain than ever but he's not a physical threat as Nerissa, who would be topped only by Dark Mother in the New Power arc (the seventh), with the villains of the following arc being again lesser threats than Nerissa (the one possible exception being the Runic Wizards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">but their storyline was dropped</a>).
<ul><li> Interestingly, Phobos is faced at his normal state only in the very end: in the first arc he's powered up by the magic he stole from the planet Metamoor, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">he's in a stolen body</a> for most of the fourth arc</span>, and in the final confrontation he's using a spell to immobilize the Guardians and circumstances to make himself invulnerable.

For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowshipOfTheRing">first few villains</a> they face are his most terrifying servants the supernatural Nazgul, then they encounter a colony of weak but numerous goblins and a hulking cave troll, and split just before dealing with Saruman's super-orc Uruk-Hai.

</li><li> Each of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> sequels introduced a more advanced Terminator model as the antagonist. There are plot reasons for this, since Skynet is sending Terminators back into the past from increasingly later points in the future, thus the models are stronger than the previous ones.
<ul><li> The T-800 Terminator in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Super Tough</a> hulking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, pitted against human fighters.

It also has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">in-built plasma cannon in one of its arms</a>, and can hack into most mechanical systems and operate them remotely.

The movie does play it both ways however, since while the Terminator threat is larger than ever, the Terminators themselves actually seem <em>less</em> efficient than in previous movies because they uncharacteristically hold back during fights due to the protagonists' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorGenisys">Terminator Genisys</a></em> introduces two new Terminator models, the T-3000 and the T-5000. The T-3000 is even more difficult to destroy than the T-1000 since it's actually a colony of nanomachines taking on a human shape that can shrug off just about anything. It's even more dangerous because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's a roboticized John Connor</span> and thus knows how its targets think. The heroes are at a disadvantage since the Terminator on their side, the Guardian aka "Pops", has suffered wear and tear due to age. The T-5000 is the most advanced Terminator seen so far, being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an avatar of Skynet itself</span>. In its brief screen-time it effortlessly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills John Connor by transforming him into a T-3000</span> and wipes out an entire roomful of Resistance soldiers.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, she has to face a <em>colony</em> of them, including their Queen.

And finally played half-straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em> when a colony of them is being faced again, but this one consists of no more than 12 individuals in addition to their Queen, as well as some sort of alien-human hybrid in the end.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em> makes use of this trope, with each main villain becoming more competent. Alluded to in <em>The Dark Knight</em> where the first time we see Batman he handily arrests Scarecrow. In addition, the first two movies have Gotham City at risk of losing hope or sanity. The third movie has the city at risk of every person in it dying.

</li><li> Used briefly in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera">Gamera</a></em> series. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraVsGyaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraVsGyaos">Gamera vs. Gyaos</a></em>, Gamera takes the entire film to kill Gyaos. Then, for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraVsGuiron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameraVsGuiron">Gamera vs. Guiron</a></em>, Guiron is introduced as he's effortlessly killing a Space Gyaos. This wasn't entirely intentional on the filmmaker's part, as they'd originally intended for Space Gyaos' role to be filled by a completely different, new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">kaiju</a>â€”they only reused the Gyaos costume because they couldn't make the new monster in time.
</li><li> The opposition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legion">Legion</a></em> gets increasingly stronger: Old lady &gt; an ice cream man (bummer) &gt; about 100 angels &gt; another 500 angels &gt; an uber angel.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>. The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> to arrive on Earth are <em>scouts</em> sent to cause as much mayhem as possible. Once humanity began to show resistance, the Precursors responded by sending more advanced and larger Kaiju to deal with the Jaegers. And once the plan of wiping out all Jaegers succeeded, an extermination wave of deadly Kaiju would come to destroy humanity once and for all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>, Flash Thompson is designed as the primary antagonistic character during the beginning of the film, which quickly graduates to Uncle Ben's killer for a short period and then, at long last, the Green Goblin.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderman">The Amazing Spiderman</a></em> does more-or-less the same thing, though it replaces the Green Goblin with The Lizard.

Lone Wolf actually manages to kill two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Darklords</a> in the first five books; each was the leader of the Darklords at the time of their deaths. Later, Lone Wolf goes on to fight more powerful opponents.

Smith took an old, unrelated novel of his, <em>Triplanetary</em>, added the prologue and tweaked the plot to fit the Lensman universe. He then wrote <em>First Lensman</em> to bridge <em>Triplanetary</em> with the original series.</span>

Thus, the threat Harry faces grows without the villain changing.

Salvatore's 2009 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfDrizzt">Drizzt</a> novel: "When the Spellplague ravages Faerun, Catti-brie falls into a deathlike trance, taking Regis with her. Drizzt, with the most unlikely ally of all at his side, seeks the help of Cadderly â€” the hero of the recently reissued series The Cleric Quintet. But even as his beloved's life hangs by a thread, Drizzt finds himself facing his most powerful and elusive foe, the twisted Crenshinibon, the demonic Crystal Shard he believed had been destroyed years ago. And the dragon he thought was destroyed along with it. And the mind flayer. And the seven liches that created the Crystal Shard in the first place. All in one godlike entity that calls itself the Ghost King." To calibrate the algorithm, it is the last book in R.A. Salvatore's eighth Forgotten Realms series. But then, Drizzt is a D&amp;D hero, with complete stats - and quite strong enough to face a squid thingy and a dragon and a group of liches.
</li><li> Intially played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> series by Jim Butcher, but later Averted. After fighting an evil wizard with more ambition and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">enjoyment for kicking puppies</a> than actual power or brains in the 1st book, Harry Dresden fights werewolves, ghosts, vampires and the <em>faerie queens</em> by the 4th book... and back down to vampires in the 6th. While there's plenty of fighting and Harry and the other protagonists are powerful in their own ways, the drama generally comes from scheming and Harry's personal stake in the matter. The faeries in <em>Proven Guilty</em> would have been no problem for Harry even back in book 1, but the problem was that now he had to handle the person who summoned them as well.
<ul><li> Also, the most dangerous antagonists are not always the ones with the greatest raw power. Villains like Nicodemus and Mavra are significant threats not because of their admittedly considerable powers, but because they are cunning, patient, and pragmatic. Tactics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation">Flaw Exploitation</a> win out over brute force more often than not.
</li><li> Lampshaded when, caught in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> between several supernatural heavy hitters, Harry reminisces about Bianca St. Claire, a "mere" high-ranking vampire and powerful sorceress. However much she might have terrified him at the time, she was just peanuts compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods">Physical Gods</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> he'd tangle with in later books.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> also by Jim Butcher, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">the Vord</a> have this as a superpower, which when coupled with the raw intellect of their Queens is just as scary as it sounds. Even though the Vord are defeated in the early books, this just taught the Queen new tricks to use to modify future generations of her children, so that when they come back they're <em>far</em> more formidable. The only way to stop the Vord for good <em>without</em> this happening seems to be to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill the Queen</span>.
<ul><li> Also played generally straight in <em>Alera</em> with the three successive invading forces. The Marat are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> barbarian elves who are very individually formidable but don't really have the logistics to take and hold much of Alera; it also turns out that it's mostly one particularly bloodthirsty leader who wants them fighting Alera in the first place, and once he's removed other leaders are willing to talk things out. Next, the Canim are highly disciplined, technologically advanced wolfmen who succeed in waging a prolonged war along the Aleran coast- at least until it turns out they're only there to try and escape from the even more formidable enemy that assaulted their homeland, which turns out to be the Vord, mentioned above, who nearly destroy the world.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s works- the supernatural powers of evil tend to get <em>weaker</em>, not stronger, as the timeline advances. The supernatural powers of good <em>also</em> get weaker, however (or at least less accessible) in accord with the general transition of Middle-Earth from a mythological world to a more realistic one. If you start with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> and then go to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, however, it's played straight, going from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being a dragon (dangerous on his own to be sure, but lacking minions or the ambition to range far from home without proper incentive) to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> with world-conquering ambition.
<ul><li> Although at the very end of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, the heroes have to face one last battle: a handful of bandits in the Shire. After the climax and death of Sauron, this seems comparatively petty.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em>, the threats the protagonists are up to against increse with progressing story, from the inefficient DomDaniel of <em>Magyk</em> over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Etheldredda</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Tertius Fume</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Darke Domaine</a> in <em>Darke</em>.
<ul><li> Although, at the same time this is also sort of inverted: DomDaniel was actually the most powerful villain faced in the series, being an ultra-powerful undead sorcerer trying to conquer the world, but due to being mostly killed before the series started, he has little of his old power and has to act through his less-capable apprentices. Etheldredda and Fume were not only ghosts, but were also just ordinary jerks acting on petty grudges who happened to have found great powers. Finally, the true villain of <em>Darke</em> was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merrin Meredith, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, who had happened to find a source of Darke power, but ultimately was just a childish, nasty loser</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant">Skulduggery Pleasant</a></em> series plays this straight for the first three books, and zig-zags it for the rest of the series: Mevolent, the overlord of evil mages who was supposedly the biggest threat the magic world had faced so far, died long before the series began. The villain of the first book, Nefarian Serpine, was just one of his lieutenants, but was also extremely dangerous and managed to get his hands on a source of godlike power. Then came the second of the three lieutenants, Baron Vengeous, who explicitly invokes this trope when Skulduggery claims that if Serpine was a 10/10 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnAScaleFromOneToTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnAScaleFromOneToTen">on the scale of evil</a>, Vengeous was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">an 11</a>. The third book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subverts</a> this by at first setting up the villain as a trio of Mevolent's minor officers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who's leader doesn't even have magic</span>, but then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Faceless Ones</a></span>, the villains that all the other villains were serving, who are powerful enough to destroy human civilization as easy as stepping on an ant colony, show up. The fourth and fifth books abruptly subvert the Algorithm by putting the heroes up against a gang of minor villains who are out for revenge and a swarm of evil ghosts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> abilities, and then the <em>sixth</em> book plays it straight by including no less than <em>three</em> supervillain Necromancers (The Deathbringer, Lord Vile and Darquesse) with the capacity to destroy the world (although the stronger two, Lord Vile and Darquesse, are not interested in that at this point). The seventh book introduces a new God-like mage, who just wants to make the world a better place by giving everyone magic - even though everyone (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an alternate version of him</span> believes this is a bad idea and the Mortals will use it to kill each other). To make things worse, three mortal teenagers who he gave magic to as an experiment are clear sociopaths, killing people for fun and becoming a serious threat to mages. After they're all defeated, the eighth book introduces a new enemy who has been hinted at since Book 5 - the magical communities in other worlds, who are so fed up with the Mages in Ireland constantly coming close to letting the apocalypse happen that they've decided to take things into their own hands and are trying to take over - in other words, the new enemy is normal mages - hundreds of millions of them. Finally, the ninth book reintroduces Darquesse, who's been occasionally appearing for half the series - but now she's stronger than ever before. So yeah, the series plays with this trope a lot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles">The Laundry Files</a></em> both inverts this and plays it straight, since the villains get progressively less <em>powerful</em> but progressively more <em>dangerous</em>. The villain of the first book was a cosmic-scale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that <em>eats universes</em>, but it ended up being defeated without causing any damage to our universe, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and without a single casualty</span>. The next villain was an insane millionaire with vast resources trying to reactivate an ancient biological superweapon, both of whom ended up dying before they could do anything beyond killing a few people. Then there was a fairly generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">cult</a> of (mostly) ordinary people, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who cause the hero far more suffering than any other threat so far, and come within a hairsbreadth of <em>killing</em> him and summoning a demon to destroy the world, necessitating a full-out military operation to defeat, AND they had already horribly murdered countless people</span>. The latest villain was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>, armed only with money, religious fervor, and a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Puppeteer Parasites</a>...who pretty much took over a large chunk of Colorado and tried to summon one of the most powerful and evil forces in the multiverse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and (partially) SUCCEEDED</span>. The sixth Laundry Files novel, "The Annihilation Score," uses this trope name as the title for the second section of the book.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> novel <em>Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream</em> has Wedge Antilles trying to string along a merely average Yuuzhan Vong commander at Borleias in order to buy time for the rest of the fleet to regroup after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fall of Coruscant.</span> But due to a snafu, they accidentally kill him (prompting Tycho Celchu to snark that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">"Wedge Antilles was so good he couldn't lose when he tried to."</a>), and Warmaster Tsavong Lah responds by sending his own father Czulkang Lah, a far more effective CO, to command the reinforcements.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played Straight</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>. The first Forsaken are Aginor and Balthamael, who are taken care off quite easily. Be'lal proves a bit of a harder challenge, managing to control Tear for a while and shortly having a few characters captured. With Asmodean, Rand only barely wins the struggle, but Asmodean causes no other problems, while Moghedien is also defeated (though not for good). In book 5, Lanfear nearly manages to control Rand before she is defeated, and Caemlyn has to be freed from Rhavin, and in the next book Rand is captured for a while before freed, though his capturers are, strictly spoken, not evil. In book 7, Rand has to free Illian from Sammael, who did put up something of a battle before he was defeated (albeit rather disappointingly). In Path of Daggers a few bad guys manage to scare Rand into hidiing for the next book, and in book 11 Semirhage nearly manages to kill Rand. In book 12, she nearly does so again and does manage to make him near-totally insane until his epiphany. In book 13, Mesaana is inches away from either enslaving Egwene or managing to get Egwene killed in her sleep (though, to be fair, the assassins weren't hers). In book 14, Graendal nearly destroys the armies of the Light by corrupting their commanders to make small, but eventually fatal mistakes and the problems are only barely in time discovered, with heavy losses incurred. Then, Demandred is very nearly victorious against the forces of Light in the Last Battle before he is killed, leaving his army without head while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a> joins the fight (which would not have been enough to turn the tide had Demandred still lived) and Cyndane is literally an arm's length away from stopping Rand at the crucial moment, which would have resulted in a win for the Dark One.
<ul><li> Also played straight in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEyeOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEyeOfTheWorld">The Eye Of The World</a>, where the protagonists first have to put up with a hundred Trolloks then a few hundreds plus Mashadar, and then the Blight plus two Forsaken.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheUnexploredSummonBloodSign">The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign</a></em> is a deliberate aversion of this. The main villain, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the White Queen</span>, is active in the very first volume and in all subsequent ones. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She</span> is always the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> to the human villains of each volume, who also don't follow a linear progression of power. The reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kyousuke</a> doesn't get immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomped</a>, despite this trope being subverted, is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the White Queen is in love with him and deliberately gives him opportunities to win</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> doesn't have the usual progression from one installment to another â€” they aren't even in chronological order anyway â€” but instead has a variant where nearly every individual novel starts with facing the threat of one enemy faction, only for it to turn out that an even more dangerous enemy is coming from behind the scenes. This allows ranking them all in an order based on who's the more dangerous enemy (in this series) that can be the hidden threat behind someone else: Tau/Orks &lt; Tyranids &lt; Chaos &lt; Necrons.

His goal was to destroy the Glades of Star(ling) City in retaliation for his wife's death twenty years prior.
</li><li> Season Two: Slade Wilson, who was as skilled as Malcolm (if not more so) but was also empowered by the Mirakuru, which enhanced his speed and strength on top of driving him insane. Slade wished to destroy Star(ling) city as revenge for Oliver's role in Shado's death.
</li><li> Season Three: Ra's al Ghul, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior">World's Best Warrior</a> and leader of the League of Assassins. Ra's skill and experience alone was enough to match Mirakuru!Slade, if not surpass him. Ra's main objective was to get Oliver to succeed him as the Demon's Head, and part of the initiation ceremony was the destruction of Star(ling) City through use of the Alpha-Omega Virus.
</li><li> Season Four: Damien Darhk, a contemporary and former rival of Ra's, whose skill as a combatant was actually just a bit below his. However, Darhk was more dangerous, as he had magic at his disposal, meaning that unless you were a meta, you were screwed. His goal was the most grandiose of all â€” nuking the world.

<ul><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash, who was able to successfully defeat Barry in their first clashes. However, Thawne's speed is fluctuating and requires constant use of tachyonic technology to keep it stable. He also suffers the drawback of being unable to kill Barry at all, since he needs him to become fast enough to create a breach of the space-time continuum that Thawne can get back home through.
</li><li> In Season Two, Zoom is not only faster than Barry, but manages to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> successfully steal his speed</span> for a time. He has several abilities unavailable to Thawne, including the ability to toss lightning and create clones of himself through time travel. Finally, Zoom has an entire army of metahumans that he can pit against Team Flash as he pleases.
</li><li> Season Three features Savitar, who spends most of his screen time bound to the Speed Force. He is so impossibly fast that only speedsters like the Flash can see the wisps of light he leaves behind. He can use the powers of the Philospher's Stone to invade the mind sof others and pit the members of Team Flash against one another. Finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is revealed to be a time remnant of Future Barry Allen, giving him an intimate knowledge of Team Flash that no other villain had. No matter what plan Barry comes up with to stop him, Savitar will simply draw on whatever new memories he gains and plan around it. Only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of H.R. allows the heroes to disrupt Savitar's plan and kill him once and for all.</span>

Sometimes, they justify this by having found a new magical or technological breakthrough in their monster creation process.
<ul><li> The seasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> are very obvious at this with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>. Whenever a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> arrives, they are always said to be a bigger threat compared to the previous one, forcing the Rangers to get new powers and Zords.

However, its scheme was to hide among human society and establish itself as a successful human fortune teller. When the time was right, it would execute its plan to sacrifice its customers to resurrect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. This is the reason it only appeared near the finale

The series starts with General Branken, commanding the mindless Hades Beasts. These are succeeded by Meemy, who commands the sentient Hades Beastmen. Near the end of his run, Meemy summons the insanely strong Hades Beasmen Kings. After Meemy and this group are defeated, they are replaced with the Hades Gods of Infershia. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a></em> also displays this trope, but not to the explicit extent of <em>Magiranger</em>, making no real distinction in the groups of monsters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Juken Sentai Gekiranger</a></em> justifies this by having Rio, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being inexperienced in the evil martial art Rinjuken Akugata. To become stronger, he periodically resurrects long dead masters of said art, who come with their own set of stronger monsters. Rio himself becomes a pupil to these masters, becoming stronger over the course of the series.
</li><li> Justified somewhat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em> where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a recently released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">sealed evil</a> who has lost much of his power, and thus grows stronger throughout the season much as the heroes do.
</li><li> Also justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> (which is superb at justifying, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a>, standard <em>Power Rangers</em> tropes) with the assertion that the evil Venjix computer virus is developing increasingly advanced technology over time. The early monsters relied on their quirks as opposed to raw power and strength. That explains why they were at the front.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a></em>: At first glance it might even seem like the Stargate Program was responsible for Earth being attacked by the Goa'uld â€” Earth being safely ignored by them until the SGC used the Stargate and wound up killing Ra. However, if the stargate had never been dug up in the first place, then humanity would never have (re)discovered the Goa'uld until humans discovered FTL travel on their own probably hundreds of years from now... and the Goa'uld would probably have been out there waiting for them. So in the case of the overall series' problem itself, the SGC didn't create the villain, just drew their attention prematurely.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> started with Apophis. When they finally got rid of him, even stronger Goa'uld showed up. But that's okay, the team got good at dispatching Goa'uld. So Anubis shows up, with the full knowledge of the godlike beings who had created the stargates. But they took care of him â€” though it was a close one. For almost a whole month there is peace. Then the godlike Ori turn up. <br/><br/>This progression is grounded in the plot by Tok'ra. He says that every time the Tau'ri defeat a System Lord an even worse one inevitably takes his or her place. By killing Ra, and others, SG-1 kept disrupting the Goa'uld balance of power, allowing more aggressive Goa'uld to sweep up now-leaderless forces and rise in threat level. They didn't cause Anubis, but probably sped up his timetable. They did make the Replicators more dangerous, by giving the nanotech precursor of the Replicators to the Asgard, from whom it was then captured. A self-application of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">Unwanted Assistance</a>, the Ori only found out about the Milky Way galaxy when Daniel Jackson and Vala accidentally warped over to their home galaxy and caused a scene. An unfortunate coincidence, perhaps, but still their doing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> team woke up the Wraith <em>and</em> turned on the Asurans' hostility switch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a> indeed. The last episode of <em>Atlantis</em> was essentially the concept of when the villains skip a few levels past where the heroes are expecting.
</li></ul></li><li> The first season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> has Molly tell us at point-blank range that there is another, much bigger bad than Sylar, who hasn't shown up yet. It turns out that the one Molly's scared of isn't even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Season 2; just the disciple of someone nastier... Adam Monroe, arguably the primary founder of The Company. However, in contrast to Sylar (a power-stealer with a dozen different ways to murder you), Adam is simply an extremely cunning and manipulative man who's very good at getting people to do what he wants. Oh, and who's also got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that makes him nigh-immortal.
<ul><li> Also, the algorithm looks to be subverted as of the second season finale: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Adam becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> again, and his successor appears to be none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sylar</span>.
</li><li> Volume 3 had Arthur Petrelli, a power-draining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> who (after stealing all of Peter's abilities) was essentially a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>.
</li><li> Out the window with Volume 4, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a non-powered government agent who leads SWAT teams with dart guns. Then again, Sylar's helping them...
</li><li> Volume 5 has Samuel Sullivan, the superhuman Antichrist, whose Earthbending ability is powered by the number of followers he has and who, with enough followers, is strong enough to crack the Earth in half.
</li><li> Generally speaking, apart from volume 2 and 5, it hasn't mattered who the Big Bad is, given Sylar's tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">hijack the plot</a>. This was rumoured to <em>supposed</em> to happen in volume 2 as well, but the season was left unfinished due to the 2007 writer's strike.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>: The first season is about Drazen's personal vendetta against Jack and Palmer. The second is about a threatened nuclear attack on Los Angeles. This escalates to a <em>successful</em> nuclear attack at the <em>beginning</em> of Season 6. The trope is used within individual seasons as well. In season 1, the main antagonists of the first few hours are a pair of college kids, followed by a local gangster, and building all the way up to a very well-funded international terrorist group, plotting for the release of an ex-dictator with the help of a group of heavily-armed mercenaries. And it happens from season to season, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of season four actually working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of season five, with that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> working for a minor villain in season six</span>... and as it turns out, most of <em>those</em> villains were actually working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of season seven.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, which actually followed a Bell Curve of Evil. At first, the villains grew progressively more powerful, from warlocks, to demons, to the Source of All Evil himself. Once the Source of All Evil was blown to bits three times over halfway through the show's run things went a bit downhill. Later Big Bads included a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> angel, the Source's slightly less powerful rival, and finally the show's last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> were the heroine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterparts</a>, who were roughly at the same power level they were.
</li><li> Reversed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em>, largely as a result of plot decay. While in the first few seasons the IMF went up against international terrorists, tyrannical dictators, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Menace</a>, later seasons mostly found them up against the Mob.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, the villains are mainly unseen: the monster in the pilot, then Ethan, about whom not much is known. The main antagonist is arguably "the unknown". The second and third seasons are more about the Others. The fourth season introduced the freighties, who made the Others look more like the "good guys" they've always claimed to be. The fifth season introduced the series' true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the immortal, pure evil <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Man in Black, aka The Monster</span>. His only hindrance was that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> couldn't kill the heroes directly</span>, but he racked up a huge body count during the final season and made even master manipulator Ben look weak and powerless.
</li><li> The new series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> does this with their season finales. In Series 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a far future Earth is invaded by Daleks</span>. In the second, present day Earth is invaded <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">first by Cyberman and then by the Daleks</span>. In Series 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Master</span>'s invasion of modern day Earth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turns it into a dystopian wasteland</span>. In Series 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Davros threatens the disintegration of all universes in all of reality</span>. The first season led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> upped the threat again, with all the universes being threatened of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">having never existed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">in the first place</a> </span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> had an odd way of upping the ante each season while making old villains "join the team". First season had Captain Bialar Crais pursuing the protagonists with his one warship. At the end of the first season, Crais is usurped by Scorpius, a rival commander of the Peacekeeper force, and Crais becomes an increasingly trustworthy ally over the next two seasons. By the start of the fourth season, Scorpius is on the outs due to being spectacularly humiliated by the heroes and the machinations of the more politically powerful Commandant Grayza, so he starts to hitch rides and help out the heroes, although he remains much more evil than Crais. The fourth season then does a switch half-way through and makes the evil reptilian Scarrans the main bad guys, supplanting the Peacekeepers for top evil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>: Seasons 1-2 initially had the Yellow-Eyed Demon as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who gets replaced by the more powerful Lilith in seasons 3-4, and then by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Devil himself</span> in season 5. Lampshaded, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainPedigree">Villain Pedigree</a>, near the end of season five when Sam asks Dean if he remembers when they just fought things like wendigos. When it comes to the big bads, the usual downside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> structure is averted, as the lower-ranking villain usually has to free the higher-ranking villain before they can step in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yellow-Eyes released Lilith, who went on to release Lucifer</span>. In all, the writers are kind of shameless in using this trope. A brief timeline of the show's enemies by season:
<ul><li> In season 1, the Winchesters were fighting regular monsters since way back when Demons were introduced as the ultimate evil that could only be killed by the Colt. The first mini-boss was Meg, a low-ranking manager, and the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was a high ranking demon, who doesn't die until the end of season 2.
</li><li> Season 3 introduces Lilith, the highest-ranking demon of them all, but also a magic knife that one-shots any demon that isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, meaning that by this time, formerly invincible/immortal demons of Meg's rank or sometimes higher would routinely get one-shotted before they can say a full sentence.
</li><li> In season 4, we're introduced to angels, who are at the time understood to be the most powerful beings in the universe other than God Himself, and it's outright stated that nothing can kill them except another angel.
</li><li> By season 5, this trope into overdrive as humans are killing angels wholesale with a different magic knife. It even gets to the point where Sam and Dean can kill low-level gods with relative ease.
</li><li> Season 6 subverted this trope somewhat, but "the mother of all monsters" is still pretty high-ranking. A corrupted angel ascends to becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> at the end, but he quickly loses his powers because his virtual omnipotence was too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a>.
</li><li> Season 7 introduced the Leviathans as beings so powerful and dangerous that God locked them away in purgatory to stop them from killing angels. Though this is mostly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> because as it turns out, the Leviathans are pretty weak, routinely getting stopped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">detergent</a>, thus inverting the trope.
</li><li> By season 8 the show's writers clearly became aware of this problem after the Lucifer arc, so while angels are still getting killed by the thousands off-screen, this trope seems to have slowed down.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Season Eleven is a clear example of this trope, the first completely clear example of a villain powerful enough that she topped Lucifer. Lucifer can't claim to be equal to God (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">although he might wish he had such a status</a>), and he was defeated without God breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">his usual policy of nonintervention</a>. But The Darkness is God's sister, and truly seems to be as powerful as God. She poses so much more of a threat that God not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent">decides to fight her with his full power</a>, but accepts that he needs the help of Lucifer (and other similarly untrustworthy allies) in order to do it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> series is no stranger to this trope, although it became more noticeable during the Heisei Era when they started giving the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Modes</a> at a certain point in the show when a new tier of bad guy showed up. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga">Kamen Rider Kuuga</a></em> the villainous Gurongi are a warrior race with a strong class system. It is only honorable that a fight must start with the weakest and after they're finished the next strongest group takes their turn.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em> also pulls this off, but in twist. The Sonozakis don't take on Double one by one, but instead, someone else with ties to the family. One of those ties being in a relationship with Saeko, one of the family members.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze">Kamen Rider Fourze</a></em>, the first half of the series revolves around the baddies trying to find potential candidates into becoming one of their own (labelled as a "Horoscope"). One of the main villains gets the power to identify who can evolve from a normal Zodiarts into a Horoscope faster, and so, normal Zodiarts are gone, replaced by Horoscopes as MOTW.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> is a strange case in that rather than having a single villain faction, different groups of antagonists show up throughout the show's run and unseat one another. In the initial arc, Rider battles are comparable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a> games, with Inves occasionally playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>.

The first villains, the organization Faust, start out sending Smash monsters, with the leaders Night Rogue and Blood Stalk showing up from time to time to challenge the heroes. Eventually, Faust falls apart, but by this point they've already succeeded in their goal of starting a civil war, which leads to the next villains, the Hokuto region, who not only have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> made up of humans who can turn into powerful Smash, but also their own Kamen Rider.

The reward for killing you grows over time, attracting higher-level assassins. Also averted: the games allow you to wander wherever you want, and some of the starting areas are directly adjacent to areas with creatures that can kill low-level characters in one shot. It's also averted in the very beginning.

</li><li> Averted in the MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, Paragon City is divided in many different zones, each of which has its own difficulty level.

Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> are structured like this; the only thing stopping a low-level character from reaching high-level areas are the powerful monsters. The sorting algorithm is there, just pointed out as how you should do things, not enforced. Typically, the very high-level areas are an inordinately long walk from the low-level areas, or behind a locked door for which the key is easily acquired on the high-level side, in order to at least suggest the intended progression. However, not always: the Forsaken starting area in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> contains a mid-level dungeon in one corner, and is directly adjacent to one of the max-level areas, with some helpful NPCs hanging around to tell new players not to go past; and the Blood Elf and Night Elf starting regions aren't much better.

Atsuro notes that it is not the normal order to go after the strongest first (see quotes page). When you go to tackle the second, it turns out the third is with him as well (wisely deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">fight the people who defeated the strongest of the four at the same time</a>) and the map is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>.

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>. During one part of the game, you will need to defeat five moles, each of whom claims to be the third strongest of the moles.

Monsters power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">is scaled to yours</a>: you never have to run in terror from an overwhelming threat or carefully plan the takedown of a challenging monsters. All monsters are similar at all times. There is little sense of accomplishment in levelling up and one can complete the game's main quest while remaining at level 1. Worse, some patterns of "leveling up" make you weaker: you must pick the right skills to advance to stay still. In the end, the difficulty slider lets you change your level more than leveling up. The benefit of this system is that as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> the player can go anywhere and do anything without fear of getting smooshed.

Each monster that appears isn't necessarily stronger then the previous one, but does have advantages compared to the previous one in order to overcome an obstacle.

The game doesn't stop you from wandering anywhere you like right from the beginning, meaning that you could end up encountering enemies that are far too powerful for you to handle. Once the XP and the ammo start rolling in, however, you can tear the world up at your leisure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> benefits from the trope. The enemy progression is: giant ants and scorpions at first then rats and geckos. The Den will probably see your first human vs. human battle with nearly everyone in leather armor, pistols or SMGs. Vault City will have metal armors and assault rifles. Redding is fairly light but piss off the Salvatores in New Reno and your ass will get lasered â€” the Sierra Army Depot nearby has various battle robots. If you are evil, Broken Hills will see your first human vs. supermutant battle. The New California Republic has policemen armed with gauss rifles. In gameplay terms, that means ouch. Both the raider hideout and Vault 15 is full of raiders in leather armor and boasting pistols and hunting rifles but three of them has combat armor and assault rifles. Mariposa is a deathtrap full of super mutants armed with laser rifles, flamethrowers, miniguns, you name it. San Francisco is light but Navarro and the Oil Rig are both utterly deadly with every single combatant clad in power armor and boasting energy weapons. Oh, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> has 999 HP, a really powerful plasma cannon, a big-ass knife and about a dozen minigun turrets for backup. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bka4');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bka4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bka4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Speedrunning the game is hard: you can get to the final battle via San Francisco. But to get there from your starting location, you have to pass near Navarro which is chock full of Enclave soldiers and plasma turrets. Regardless of how good you are, chances are very high that you will stumble into at least one Enclave patrol or a pack of Aliens/Floaters/Centaurs/Deathclaws. If this happens at level 2, you should reload immediately since you will be dead in the first turn anyway. Even an experienced character will have trouble here.</span>
</li><li> Present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> as well, depending on who you might consider evil. Listing only those who will attack no matter your faction, your first enemies consist of the geckos and giant ants wandering around, wild animals easily disposed of. The first human antagonists are very likely to be Powder Gangers. All are petty thugs and criminals armed only with what they could pillage from the prison they broke out of (pistols, dynamite, batons, the occasional break action shotgun), and any of them can be easily handled by a fast trigger finger or bashing them with a piece of old pipe. The Viper and Jackal gangs are often next and have at least basic armor and better firearms, especially since they are the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> faction to use automatics in the form of submachine guns. Moving up brings in the Fiends, a pack of drugged up, aggressively homicidal beings with highly damaging energy weapons and mid-level kinetic weapons (e.g. the hunting rifle and service rifle), but no armor and not much in the way of tactics. The game averts the scale and takes a very large step down the moment you reach Freeside, however, as you're engaged by Freeside thugsâ€”little more than desperate civilians acting as muggers, and easily dispatched by even low-level players. The aversion continues when dealing with the Three Families of the Strip, as their guards are quite weakly armed and their missions mostly revolve around subterfuge. For most players, Caesar's Legion will be up next; you may have started fighting them after the Powder Gangers and before the Vipers and Jackals, but the only Legion units you were likely to encounter then were the lowest-level ones equipped only slightly better than the Powder Gangers (but with more training). The bulk of their soldiers you'll be fighting now are armed similarly to the Fiends, bar the energy weapons, but they come in larger groups and are smarter, and at least <em>some</em> of them have real armor. Finally, after building up enough Infamy with the Legion by fighting them, they will start sending assassination squads after you, all of whom consist of elite teams with very high combat skill stats and high-tier weapons such as anti-materiel rifles, brush guns, marksman carbines, and plasma grenades. Similarly tough and well-armed troops compose the entirety of the Legion's forces during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> at Hoover Dam (but then, the friendly NCR forces are just as tough, so it's not that big of a deal).
<ul><li> <em>New Vegas</em> DLC is definitely sorting its enemies, considering the main enemies in each new zone. <em>Dead Money</em> has the Ghost People, which are melee fighters with only highly telegraphed spear or bomb throws for a ranged attack (though the Sierra Madre's holograms are less enemies and more obstacles, and not evil so much as just securing the premises via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a>). <em>Honest Hearts</em> has the well armed but unarmored and comparatively lightly trained White Legs of differing varieties. <em>Old World Blues</em> has the equally violent Lobotomites, who appear in large numbers, are naturally resistant to pain and injury, are backed by robots, and have both strong conventional weapons (like the White Legs) and various energy weapons. Finally, <em>Lonesome Road</em> has the ghoulish Marked Men (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">who used to be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">special forces</a> of the NCR and Legion), who uniformly have absurdly high health, the best possible weapons, and respectable armor, no matter their level.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, the game introduces you to combat by pitting you against Radroaches, Bloatflies, Mole Rats, and Bloodbugs, all of which can be killed with a few shots or a whack from your melee. Upon reaching Concord you'll face a gang of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid">Raiders</a> with homemade pipe weaponry, made even easier by the Power Armor and Minigun given to you, culminating with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> against an angry but basic Deathclaw. Once this is done, you travel to Diamond City, encountering basic Feral Ghouls, Super Mutants, and scattered Raider gangs en route. Moving from Diamond City to Vault 114 introduces the player to the Triggermen - a mobster-like gang who favor fighting in the tightly packed hallways of the Vault with submachine guns and baseball bats, and the first gang that will use real weapons against the player. Moving from the Vault to Kellogg's Hideout, the player encounters various predatory animals such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Yao Guai</a> and Stingwings, who are scripted to appear on the path to the place, and the hideout itself will be filled with Generations 1 and 2 Institute Synths (the robotic yet outdated infantry of The Institute who use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">relatively weak but fast firing</a> laser rifles). One boss battle against Kellogg and a cinematic later and the player has the objective of traversing down south towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Glowing Sea</a>, where the meanest of monsters, mutants, and gangs reside.

<ul><li> Chapter 2: "Goroh, The Vengeful Samurai". Samurai Goroh, bandit leader and Falcon's longtime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a>, ambushes and challenges him to a race around his turf, the Red Canyon, for Falcon's machine.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a>: The Game</em> tries to encourage you to take on the Tattaglias first, followed by the Straccis and Cuneos, leaving the Barzinis for last. However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> nature and lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridge</a>, it's perfectly okay to take them on in any order if you're skilled enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em>: the later end bosses tend to be stronger, but there's no consensus on which is the hardest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has an interesting example. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">The first game</a> has what appears to be the creator of all Heartless, the embodiment of emotion corrupted. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Chain of Memories</a></em> we see a preview of much more powerful beings called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless">Nobodies</a> who are the body and mind that's left over after a Heartless is created; then we find out that the main villain of the first game is only 1/3rd of the evil assistant of the real creator of the Heartless and the villain of this game is the other 2/3rds. All of this seems to imply that the true villain is reassembling himself. Then we get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em> in which it turns out again the main villain is more than he appears to be; in this case it turns out he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">used to be a very old powerful keyblade Master who then possesses a much younger keyblade wielder who is then split into the main villains of the first and second game</span>. This all leads into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> in which all the previous main antagonists, minus all the side games (unless you count <em>Birth By Sleep</em> a side game) combined into one holy terror of a villain.
<ul><li> The first game also features this with the Disney villains, but it's played with: The first of the villains introduced to the player character, Hades, is actually the most powerful and is fought last - and he's not at the top of their totem pole, either. (He seems to be quick to cut ties with them completely.)
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ganondorf goes from gargantuan teleporting boar, to a demon head made of pure energy to a man on horseback who can summon ghost horsemen at will, to a final fight between you and him on foot with swords. But the overall difficulty ramps up: in each successive fight you lose abilities â€” the ability to turn into a wolf and use Midna's magic, then Zelda's magic, and eventually it's down to you and your sword. And then your fishing rod.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia">Lufia</a></em> series. You beat Gades, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">a dark god of destruction</a>, only for you notice there are three more powerful villains out there. In the Sinistrals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>, it's quite clear Gades is the least powerful mainly because he can't cast powerful spells.
</li><li> Done in all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> games. What's strange here though is that there are many cases of late game areas and early game areas located right next to one another. As in, part of say, the desert is explored at the beginning and part is explored at the end of the game. Given that the enemies are scaled to match this, it means that sometimes you've literally only got a four foot wall between an area with weak enemies and one with strong ones, and no real reason why the latter never seem to cross it.
<ul><li> It's also done interestingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>, in that the big enemies Bowser fights are actually weaker than the small ones he usually just crushes underfoot.

Despite the fact that in plot terms she's poking around the place more or less at random, she encounters strictly young, weak Metroids at first, and only runs into the older and powerful Zeta, Omega, larval and Queen Metroid enemies (yes, the larval form is one of the most dangerous) after she's had time to collect a bunch of upgrades. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">The remake</a> goes a step further, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Samus goes from defeating the Queen Metroid and then suddenly being ambushed by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and the franchise's traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, Ridley.</span>
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> games starting with #3 follow the trope. You start the game in the easiest town and the more you move away from this town the harder the game becomes. <em>Might and Magic III</em> had a very tough dungeon, the aptly-named Maze From Hell not too far from the start point but it was locked and could only be entered much later in the game. The trope is completely subverted in <em>Might and Magic VI</em> though. In this game, the starting area has 3 dungeons: Goblin Watch, the starter dungeon; the Abandoned Temple, a slightly harder and longer dungeon meant to be completed next; and Gharik's Forge, one of the most difficult areas in the entire game (possibly the series) and meant for the second half of the game. The Forge is unlocked and the only way to tell it's best left for later is to enter it and watch the entire party get slaughtered within seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> generates enemies of level equal to the average of your level and the current dungeon depth. This avoids Oblivion's "every level is just as tough as you are" while still providing the same progression.
</li><li> Not just played straight, but formalized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em>, in which you fight your way up the ranks of the official top ten assassins.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona">Opoona</a>.</em> The game has an abundance of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Bosses in Mook Clothing</a> who are far stronger than anything else in their respective area, and enemies who simply have things like a great deal more health than other nearby enemies, so there are often much stronger enemies in an area than their appears. However, the game <em>also</em> likes to pull on enemies from earlier areas, leading to weak and early game enemies suddenly making a reappearance later in the game, no stronger than they were before.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon</a></em> the strength of the trainers and the wild PokÃ©mon are directly proportional to how long it is until you get there. There are some aversions: Both the Viridian and Petalburg Gyms have leaders much stronger than you likely will be when you first get there, but you can't actually battle until you're at the appropriate point in the game (with the Petalburg Gym it's because the leader knows he would just kick your ass entirely otherwise). While the Kanto trainers in GSC/HGSS play this straight in that they're all leveled to be near those of someone who beat the Elite Four (which is handwaved by someone stating Kanto has started attracting a bunch of really strong trainers), the wild PokÃ©mon avert it in that they are the same levels as they were in the first generation of games. Interestingly, the trainers still have PokÃ©mon typical of trainers in those locations in the first game, which means they must have held off on evolving them for dozens of levels.
<ul><li> It's particularly hilarious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">PokÃ©mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>: in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">PokÃ©mon Black and White</a></em>, routes 1 and 2 were basically the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">Noob Cave</a>, full of low-level trainers like children and schoolteachers. In the sequel, this area is locked off until the post-game and you can't access it until you beat the champion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">PokÃ©mon Sword and Shield</a></em> actually justifies this with its Gyms; rather than a casual event like previous generations, the Gym Challenge is a cultural event, meaning that specific protocol must be followed to ensure both protection of tradition and an effective means of weeding out the defeated for optimal entertainment. The order which the player visits the Gyms is explicitly defined (they even have an in-universe ranking system based on performance, so one can actually move up or down depending on how they match up to the other Leaders over time), meaning that the Gym Leader's Pokemon levels are preset to maintain a reasonable escalation of challenge. On the other hand, however, there is the Wild Area, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> where PokÃ©mon of widely varying levels live. By the time you arrive in the Wild Area, your party likely be around level 10, but you can run into PokÃ©mon several levels higher. The game even cautions you to be mindful of the PokÃ©mon you run into and, when in doubt, run away.

However, as you play through the game, you'll see fewer and fewer Marines being torn to shreds by you and the Infected and more and more Blackwatch troopers.

For instance, if you attempt to venture into the forest when you first begin<em> Quest For Glory 1</em>, you will almost certainly not escape alive without prior knowledge of its layout. As you acquire skills, equipment, items, and experience, you are soon able to survive the forest during the day â€” but you still had better stay out of there at night. Even as a top-level player, a nighttime venture in the forest is nigh-suicidal, thereby really giving it a sense of menace. However, as you progress from game to game, enemies as a whole become globally stronger so as to keep up the challenge. A <em>Quest For Glory 1</em> character imported into <em>Quest For Glory 4</em>, for instance, would probably be killed from the suspense alone. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note63h82');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note63h82" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note63h82');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Imports are boosted to a minimum skill level, which helps but not that much.

If you're playing as any of these guys, the peak boss is changed to 11-year old Griff Simmons on Peak One, riot grrrrrrrl Zoe Payne on Peak Two, and megalomaniac egotist Elise Riggs on Peak Three.

Averted for the series as a whole, where there's no particular scaling of villain power or threat.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> and its sequels. The power and abilities jump all over the place. Nero Chaos is easily the strongest adversary, much tougher than Roa or any of his opponents so far have been. Satsuki presumably comes after this at some point and doesn't amount to much yet. Then we have Kagetsu Tohya with Nanaya, someone Shiki can't beat, then Kishima Kouma who mainly has the advantage of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>: While the basic enemies are generally fought in ascending order of difficulty, the bosses actually get progressively weaker (going purely by their stats) until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. The game makes a distinction between a monster having raw <em>power</em> and having the <em>skill</em> to use their power effectively. Indeed, the so-called "weakest enemy", with stats that are mere 1's across the board, delivers what is unquestionably the toughest fight in the game (but you have to go pretty far out of your way to piss said character off enough to fight you).
<ul><li> The sorting algorithm seems to be based off the bosses' threat toward you rather than raw power level. The first boss, Toriel, is only trying to protect you from the other monsters, and attempts to avoid killing you outright. Papyrus is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who's only trying to capture the human. Undyne is the first boss monster that's actually trying to kill you, but she has altruistic reasons for doing so. Mettaton is a vain glory hound who is trying to kill you for his own selfish reasons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asgore is very powerful and is out to kill you, albeit very reluctantly.</span> Only the final monster, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Flowey</span>, is actually malevolent.
</li></ul></li><li> The PC game <em>Vivisector: Beast Inside</em> has this in abundance: the animalistic enemies are faced based on their level of feralness and anthropomorphism.

In a subversion, though, the final leg of the game contains "unfinished" versions of the animal enemies that are pathetically weak and easy to take out..

For one thing, this means that characters get stronger and stronger, as if they are gaining levels. People climbing the Tower are called Regulars, and they are constantly tested at successively higher floors with higher and higher difficulty. Regulars are ranked from E-class to A-class in order of ascending power, and there's a lot of variation within a class, too. Regulars of higher levels are constantly becoming more powerful, apparently due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">competition and increasing standards for advancement</a> and the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName">Shinsu</a>. Those who reach the "top" â€” the floor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Jahad's</a> palace â€” become Rankers, who gain even greater powers. They are have a rank that's simply a number indicating how far they're from being number one among Rankers. The top 1% are termed High Rankers. Usually, the higher one's rank, the more powerful that Ranker is. Some of the highest ranks are held by "Irregulars", people so powerful they can basically break all the rules of the Tower and wipe the floor with the lesser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGods">Physical Gods</a>. Also at the top are King Jahad and the heads of the Ten Great Families, who rule the Tower. That's to say nothing of the Tower's Guardians/Administrators, who gave those rulers their power. Basically, there's a ready-made roster of individuals ranging from powerless to minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity">Cosmic Entity</a> for the heroes to confront. Of course, not everyone in the Tower is automatically evil or hostile, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHalfFull">it's not a very nice place</a>, and eventually, the story seems to start building up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jahad</span> as the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The protagonist Bam starts out as a beginning Regular and starts working his way up with numerous companions. Since Bam has special talents that enable him to become powerful very quickly after he gets past a slow start, he's usually overpowered for his current level â€” he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStomp">Curb Stomp</a> a group of D-class Regulars in seconds after just becoming on himself, for example â€” so he tends to be pitted against the most powerful individuals available wherever he is. Since much more powerful beings do exist in the Tower, he occasionally has a brush-in with someone he has absolutely no chance of beating, like the Irregular Urek Mazino, but never really has to fight one of them properly, at least without having someone equally powerful to help.
</li></ul><ul><li> The antagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero">Weak Hero</a></em> form a hierarchy in their union that is steadily taken down from the weakest to the strongest. First is Jimmy Bae, a low-ranked thug with a personal grudge against the heroes. After him is Forrest, who proves a bigger threat due to his divide and conquer strategy. Next is Wolf, who's the first fighter to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Gray</a> a serious run for his money. After all of them is Jake Ji, the second strongest fighter in the series behind the leader of the Union, Donald Na himself, who's so powerful that he beat down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Big Ben</a> without taking a single hit.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>, where each progressive seasons' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> would actually be <em>less</em> powerful than the previous one (along with having smaller plots and fewer episodes dedicated to their plot arcs). Season 1's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was Ben's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, the most feared alien in the galaxy, bent on galactic conquest, who punches mountains apart and bodyslams buildings hard enough to make them explode. The following seasons featured as Big Bads an 11-year-old who shared the hero's superpowers and whose sole goal was getting revenge on the hero, an alien ghost who "only" wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, and finally a guy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> who only appeared in one episode (albeit a 2-part, 1 hour one), who had to assemble a team of previous secondary villains to do all his fighting for him, and whose big plan was to steal a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> battery that allowed his power armor to shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>.

So, though the Lyoko Warriors get better at fighting them, new and tougher monsters appear on Lyoko, and the specters sent to the real world gain greater powers and versatility over time.

Slowly, but surely he combats more appropriate villains ranging from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">Hunter of Monsters</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress">sadistic emotion sucker</a>, and his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> self. By the last season, he's battling ghosts with godlike powers.
</li><li> In the movies, <em>Danny Phantom</em> played with this one a bit. In each successive movie, the villain's physical power and general imposingness decreased, but their actual threat level increased. The first movie villain, Pariah Dark, was by far the most powerful character in the series (four Dannys in four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> could barely restrain his de-powered form), yet he only managed to control the town for a day. Next came Danny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> future self, followed by a frail ringmaster named Freakshow who nonetheless manages to warp the entire country to his liking. The biggest bad of the series ultimately turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an asteroid</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>... Timmy first starts off having to deal with mean babysitters and school bullies, eventually upgraded to his crazy fairy-hunting teacher. Now he routinely has to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>-loving Pixies and Anti-Fairies who seem to be content with nothing less than the total domination and remaking of both Earth and the magical world. This reflects his getting deeper into the world of magic, where the stakes are higher: later on there is The Darkness, which is a threat to the normal galaxy and the magical universe. Timmy is thrown right in the midst of it.
</li><li> Played straight with the epic multi-parters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. "Awakening" had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Demona and Xanatos</a>, who are certainly dangerous enemies but weren't really trying to do anything beyond controlling Goliath and his clan for use in their future schemes. In "City of Stone", Demona has acquired a spell that lets her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turn the entire human population of New York to stone</a>, making her much more dangerous. In "Avalon", the enemy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">the Archmage</a>, who is made even more powerful by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> he's toting. In "The Gathering", the clan is up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Oberon</a>, a being with godlike powers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">no morals beyond his immediate whims</a>. Finally in "Hunter's Moon" Demona's back again, this time with a virus that can destroy all non-gargoyle life on earth, making her even more dangerous than Oberon, even though she's far less powerful. Averted in the bulk of the series, though, where they face enemies of varying power-level throughout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies</a> this by saying that, due to the cosmic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfGoodAndEvil">Balance Of Good and Evil</a>, if one evil is destroyed, it causes another, stronger evil to fill in the gap (the heroes only receive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a>'s warning right after the villain's been destroyed, which leads to their Sorting Algorithm issues). Other than that, the series more or less kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Shendu</a> as the strongest foe of choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> makes it clear that they formed (and reformed) the league because they anticipated progressively stronger enemies. In a neat inversion, the Legion of Doom was organized specifically because the league was so powerful and the bad guys needed some sort of fraternity to put them on a similar level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> looked to be heading this way, but then averted it.
<ul><li> First, there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E1MareInTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E1MareInTheMoon">Nightmare Moon</a>. Likely more powerful than her sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Princess Celestia</a>, she has done everything in her power to hinder the main cast, but underestimated them and eventually was overcome once they acquired the Elements of Harmony.
</li><li> Then came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E1TheReturnOfHarmonyPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E1TheReturnOfHarmonyPart1">Discord</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who was so powerful enough that Celestia and Luna had to team up to defeat him last time; against the main characters he's able to neutralize the Elements of Harmony twice (once by stealing them, and once by breaking the friendship that powered them).
</li><li> This is averted with the next villain however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E25ACanterlotWeddingPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E25ACanterlotWeddingPart1">Queen Chrysalis</a>, who is substantially weaker than Discord and possibly weaker than Nightmare Moon. However she is also a shapeshifting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eater</a> who successfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> the captain of the Royal Guard to expose Canterlot to her invading horde, and whoâ€”as a result of absorbing all the love surrounding a weddingâ€”<em>beat Celestia in a fair fight</em>. SheÂ’s also clever enough to quickly prevent the main cast from acquiring the Elements of Harmony, thus increasing the tension through denying them most of the resources they previously counted on.
</li><li> The next villain, King Sombra, is hard to place. He's certainly stronger than Chrysalis (who even powered up struggled with Celestia, while King Sombra took <em>both</em> Celestia and Luna to take out), it's unclear just how powerful he actually is as he spends most of the two parter unable to directly attack the group. However, he's clearly more <em>dangerous</em> than any preceding villain due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> to the point his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">Near-Villain Victory</a> comes without him actually <em>needing</em> to do anything.
</li><li> Lord Tirek with his ability to drain the powers of others has the potential to become enormously powerful, even if he doesn't start that way, and by the end, he has become more powerful than anyone else in the show so far.
</li><li> Season 5 throws us another straight out aversion in Starlight Glimmer, who's the first major villain to be just another normal pony. A very skilled and smart pony, but at the time of her debut episode only influential enough to threaten one small village (which doesn't make her any less scary). In the Season 5 finale, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Starlight proves to be a much greater threat. Twilight notes that Starlight is one of the most magically talented ponies she knows: she has rewritten a time travel spell to let her significantly alter time, and has mastered self-levitation magic and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel">fight Princess Twilight to a standstill in magic, possibly for an eternity</a>. Said time spell causes several apocalyptic futures, the last of which is even worse than every villain before.</span>
</li><li> Season 8 downright inverts this trope with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cozy Glow</span>, who is only a filly, albeit an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">extremely psychopathic one</a>.
</li><li> Season 9 introduces Grogar, who is established to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor">Monster Progenitor</a> and the most powerful evil force in Equestria, bringing together a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a> of all non-reformed villains. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This then gets subverted with the plot twist that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">"Grogar" was just Discord impersonating the historic villain</a>, and the villains of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> are the already-established Chrysalis, Tirek and Cozy Glow.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In an aversion, while he's received some upgrades over the years, Megabyte from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> is not only still the main villain, but with the exception of the now-deleted virus Daemon, he seems have become the most powerful virus in existence!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> both uses and ultimately subverts this with its seasonal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>
<ul><li> Season 1: Slade is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">very cunning</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">Empowered Badass Normal</a> against a superpowered team; he can take any of them one-on-one, but against the whole team he gets curbstomped badly. As a result, he spends most of his time hiding in the shadows and plotting.
</li><li> Season 2: Slade is back, but this time he's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Terra</a>, one of the most powerful characters in the show, working for him. He loses only when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">turns on him</a>.
</li><li> Season 3: Brother Blood has a wide range of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> that let him control large groups of minions <em>and</em> handle the entire team with minimal effort. It takes the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> to finish him off.
</li><li> Season 4: Trigon is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">demonic personification of evil</a> and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">every bit as tough</a> as that implies; once he's out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">can</a> he causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">Hell on Earth</a> in <em>moments</em>. He only goes down at all because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Raven</a> is his daughter.
</li><li> Season 5: The Brain breaks the pattern. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">very smart</a> but physically helpless; even with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a> allowing him to present a global threat, he's still not on Trigon's power <em>or</em> danger level.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Guild of Calamitous Intent</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> fame. Enrolled villains (and protagonists alike) are ranked in order of their threat level; a low-ranking villain such as The Monarch is a good fit for a wash-up scientist like Doctor Venture, while a full-fledged superhero such as Captain Sunshine needs an equally sinister antagonist to match him. Villains and protagonists can increase (or decrease) in rank if their skills improve (or degenerate). And it's all good for keeping the bureaucracy happy, and making sure there's no outright murders of one or the other.
</li><li> Subverted in the cartoon adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, where the relative power levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragons</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> seem to spike up and down from time to time. The most powerful evil entity in the series is Prince Phobos, fought by the girls at the end of season one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and a bit at the end of season two</span>. He's <em>always</em> dangerous, and always requires the guardians to pull some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a> to beat. Season two's villain is Nerissa, less powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">but more cunning</a> than Phobos. Season two's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squads</a> elevate in power throughout the season (from Phobos' former mooks to custom-created elemental monsters and finally to the former Guardians themselves), but despite this, Nerissa's power remains generally the same, even as she absorbs Hearts throughout the season. Nerissa frequently runs from the guardians rather than fight them, as she gets trounced whenever she faces them directly. She's still a threat because of her planning, however. By the end of it all, the final battle of season two <em>is</em> against a bad guy who's as powerful as Phobos and Nerissa combined: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Cedric</a>, who has consumed Phobos in order to absorb his and Nerissa's powers, along with the powers of the former Guardians</span>, but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">he doesn't know how to shot elements</a>, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss">goes down in a few minutes in spectacular fashion</a></span>.
<ul><li> Once again they never actually fight Phobos at his normal level, as all fights between him and the main characters have been when he's gained some sort of power boost.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>, the team starts out mostly going up against the Brotherhood, a gang of mutants who are powerful, but not terribly competent (or, for the most part, terribly evil), making them fairly easy opponents. At the end of the first season they meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">Magneto</a>, who is far more powerful, cunning, and professional than his pawns, and he only gets later on when he starts being accompanied by his elite Acolytes. In the third and fourth seasons, though, the focus shifts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Apocalypse</a>, the most powerful mutant <em>ever</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">capable of defeating almost any other character in the show with ease</a> and possessing world-spanning plans.

</li><li> S1-S3: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Wuya</a> is a sentient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>, remaining a (mostly) harmless ghost for the majority of the Show's run, but when her true form is finally revealed in the season 1 finale, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> and single handedly conquers the World. They defeat her by getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> from the last person who beat her, that turns her back into a ghost. She's once again re-fleshed in season 3 albeit with her powers nerfed by another villain for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">being too untrustworthy</a>. Still she's a worthy foe whenever she's fought.
</li><li> S2: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Chase</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Young</a> is introduced as an unstoppable martial arts master with a taste for dragons, he soon blossoms into the new big bad for season 2, enacting a nefarious scheme to turn one of the heroes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">Heylin Way</a>. He's so competent, he's never been bested in straight 1 vs 1 combat by the main characters. While still playing a very active part in season 3, he eventually gets overshadowed by....
</li><li> S3: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Hannibal Roy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Bean</a> the show's embodiment of true evil, the only character that has no trace of a likability to him. His theoretical victory over the protagonists is described (by Chase Young no less) as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">WORSE</a> than the end of the world. Far....far worse. While not exactly stronger than Chase, he's easily more dangerous.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats">ThunderCats (1985)</a></em> had a form. While they kept using most of the same major villains later in the show, the mutants became more of a threat under Ratar-o's more competent leadership. Mum-ra gained the Sword of Plun-darr and lost his weakness to mirrors. And we were introduced to a new group of villains in the Luna-taks, who were so powerful as a group they usually only showed up singly or in pairs so the Thundercats would have a chance of winning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> ultimately uses this formula, at least in its first season. The pilot, <em>Spark of Rebellion</em>, begins with easily-conquered stormtroopers who can't do squat against the rebels. In the midst of the episode, we are introduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Agent Kallus</a>, a formidable ISB agent. In the third episode of the main series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Inquisitor</a> makes his first real appearance, and the heroes barely escape with their lives. In the midst of the season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Grand Moff Tarkin</a> appears, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> executes his most incompetent soldiers, proving that he means business</span>. And come season's end, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inquisitor</span> is dead, but he is replaced by <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Darth Vader</span></em>. It's unlikely the trope will be played straight from this point on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (Darth Vader is the Empire's greatest warrior, after all)</span>, but time will tell.
<ul><li> Season 2 starts off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averting</a> this with Darth Vader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomping</a> all the heroes, their Rebellion cell and undoing all their hard work on Lothal. Then played straight with the heroes facing off first against Imperial characters such as Agent Kallus, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Seventh Sister</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Fifth Brother</a> are introduced to replace the Inquisitor. The season switches plays with this for several episodes by switching threats, until the finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">re-introduces Maul. Who quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">kills the the Inquisitors</a> and proves much more cunning, aiming the seduce Ezra to the Dark Side and blinding Kanan. Last of all, Darth Vader returns near the end, forcing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">Ahoska to hold the line while the others escape</a></span>.
</li><li> Season 3 looks to continue this with the introduction of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grand Admiral Thrawn</span> as the new major threat and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maul</span> still around from the previous season's finale.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> starts off with Lord Hater as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Despite his power, Hater was childish, incompetent, insecure, short-tempered and overall more of a comedic villain than anything. In fact, by the time Season 2 rolls around, he had been upgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>.
<ul><li> Then Season 2 brings along anew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by the name of Lord Dominator. A sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> who wants to destroy the galaxy simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. Not only is she the first character to outright murder another sympathetic character onscreen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she also basically <em>succeeds</em> in her plan, destroying every planet in the galaxy save one, though the planets do end up springing back to life after some time</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> it first appears that there is no greater threat than the monsters the Crystal Gems fight early on, which are soon revealed to be simply other gems who have lost their minds. However, once the plot about the Crystal Gems' rebellion against Homeworld is revealed, a Homeworld gem called Peridot becomes the first major recurring villain. She poses a decent threat for a while but is fairly easily redeemed and befriended once the gems are able to capture her unarmed and realize that she isn't truly evil, just indoctrinated to Homeworld's views. This leaves Peridot's escort Jasper, who is much more dangerous and personally invested in fighting the Crystal Gems, to fill that role. After her defeat Topaz and Aquamarine show up and are an even bigger threat. And beyond them, there's the leaders of all the Homeworld Gems, the Great Diamond Authority.
