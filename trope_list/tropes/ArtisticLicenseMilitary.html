</div></div><p>An artistic license trope that pertains to depictions of the military in film and television. This ranges from minutiae (forgetting which branch of the military uses which ranks) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> (having a character all but assault superior officers with no consequences).

</p><p></p><ul><li> Failing to distinguish between the military and other government (CIA, FBI, police) and non-government (mercenaries) entities.
</li><li> Failing to distinguish between different branches of the military (e.g., using "army" to refer to any military unit), or mixing and matching different military branch ranks into one service (e.g., sergeants in the Navy or admirals in the Army - though note that not all countries make the same distinctions between branches as the U.S.).
</li><li> Incorrect use of service-specific jargon (e.g., army privates regularly saying "aye, aye" without being ironic.)
</li><li> Failing to understand the fundamental concept of the chain of command (e.g., having regular privates taking orders directly from the President in the field, or having a private appealing directly to the President to overrule his company commander's orders.)
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Having military fighter pilots fire missiles over the territory of the United States. This <em>cannot</em> be done unless specifically authorized by the President.
</li><li> Having military aircraft fly improbably close to the ground: near or below building height or even a scant few meters above the ground for helicopters.
</li><li> Getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks">the ranks</a> wrong, either in form of address, or in who outranks whom.
</li><li> Having people performing jobs with either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrankedSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverrankedSoldier">too high</a> or low rank (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrankingYourJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrankingYourJob">having a colonel leading a platoon in the field</a>).
</li><li> Not understanding the difference between officers and enlisted personnel in modern militaries (e.g. assuming that all officers started out as regular troopers, with lieutenant just being the next step up the ladder after sergeant).
</li><li> Getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySalute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySalute">saluting protocol</a> wrong.
</li><li> Getting patches, rank insignia, and uniforms wrong, such as having medals and ribbons inconsistent with the setting, the characters age and experiences (e.g. having Gulf War veterans wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WWI</a> medals). <a class="urllink" href="https://www.stripes.com/why-can-t-hollywood-get-military-uniforms-right-1.159651">There's a common belief<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that depicting US military uniforms with perfect accuracy is illegal and could get the cast or crew members prosecuted for impersonation, but this is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>.

</li><li> Having characters with an unlikely or downright impossible professional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> (e.g. an Air Force fighter pilot and an Air Force Special Tactics operator at the same time).
</li><li> Using incorrect weapons or incorrect models. Very common in media as it's cheaper and easier to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsUnderstudies">older weapons as stand-ins</a> for more advanced hardware that might be difficult or impossible to obtain, and vice versa.
</li><li> Using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkieTalkieGagOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkieTalkieGagOver">incorrect radio or communication protocol</a> (e.g., nobody says "over and out" - "Over" means "Done talking, awaiting response" while "out" means "Done talking, no response needed").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks">Tanks, but No Tanks</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUsage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUsage">Handling weapons incorrectly</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">dangerously.</a>
</li><li> Getting promotion/demotion procedures wrong.
</li><li> Making Boot camp either more extreme or much milder than it really is. It's not unrelenting torture, but it's not summer camp, either. Depicting ordinary Boot Camp as if it were Special Forces Training, or vice versa.
</li><li> Making the military justice system appear far more brutal (e.g. having a company commander summarily execute insufficiently enthusiastic soldiers at whim without any pretension to justice) or ineffectual (e.g. characters flagrantly disobeying orders or insulting superiors to their faces and getting no more than a slap on the wrist) than it is.
</li><li> Having no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades">rules against fraternization</a>.
</li><li> Depicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackVikings">ethnic minorities</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette">women</a> as accepted members of the military in roles that would not have been open to them in the story's regional or temporal setting (when they are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail">passing</a> as ethnic-majority or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">male</a>).
</li><li> Failing to understand the basic organisational setup of the Department of Defense and the roles and functions of its various leaders and component organizations (e.g. jointness and collaboration at the top is unheard of: the military services are fighting their own separate wars and the service chiefs report directly to no one but the President). Though this changes depending on the era (and depending on which nation you're talking about). In World War 2, for instance, the Department of Defense had not yet been established, and the branches of the U.S. military were more independent than they are today.
</li><li> Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">unjustifiably useless</a>. When not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">plain evil</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefconFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefconFive">Getting the Defcon system wrong.</a>
</li><li> At military funerals, confusing a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-volley_salute">three-volley salute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyOneGunSalute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyOneGunSalute">21-Gun Salute</a> (generally a mistake in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dialogue">dialogue</a>). The former is done by a team of riflemen (ranging from three soldiers to nineteen, depending on the rank of the deceased), while the other is performed by artillery pieces ("guns" in military parlance) and is reserved for presidents' funerals.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingSoldier">Do-Anything Soldier</a>, who is good at any mission or job you throw him. In real life they're not going to send an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> to do a commando's job: training pilot officers is very expensive.
</li></ul><p>There can be various reasons for this. Sometimes mistakes are made intentionally in order to facilitate the storytelling medium. Most often, though, Hollywood simply doesn't know or care about the particulars of the military.
</p><p>This should probably not be applied to stories set in entirely imaginary cultures, unless they show something utterly implausible, or out of keeping with what's seen in the rest of the culture (e.g. a supposed libertarian democracy that treats its soldiers more callously than the World War II Red Army, or a culture that is meant to be very hierarchical and repressive having armed forces that are very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a>).
</p><p>Most current and former members of the military find this more funny than annoying, and military films that make countless errors are still more popular with members of the military than with the general public.
</p><p>It should also be noted that since media portrayal tends to influence public perception, there are a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19016_5-myths-about-military-you-believe-thanks-to-movies.html">few myths many people believe about the military thanks to movies.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</p><hr/><strong>Since military customs, rules, and traditions vary from country to country and in some cases, branch to branch within the same country, many times what is seen as "wrong" by an audience in one country is actually correct for the military force being shown (because of this, please check that any examples are actually incorrect for the military service depicted before adding them to the page.)</strong>
<p></p><hr/><h2>Examples:</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">    open/close all folders  </div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Universal for many anime that feature military ranks: Imperial Japan used a unified rank structure for officers, i.e. all branches of the military use the same rank names and structure (<em>Sho-i</em> for Second Lieutenant/Ensign/Pilot Officer, <em>Chu-i</em> for First Lieutenant/Lieutenant Junior Grade/Flying Officer, <em>Tai-i</em> for Captain/Lieutenant/Flight Lieutenant, and so on). This was changed after World War II (JSDF naval, army, and air force ranks use different names and kanji), but it can still cause problems for translators in trying to determine whether fictional military units (such as the UN Spacy/RDF below or the EFSF of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>) should go with a naval naming convention or an army naming convention, since Japanese creators seem to prefer the prewar rank structure.
</li><li> The official subtitled version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> calls Mio a Major (an Army/Air Force rank) in the subtitles. It's the right grade, but as a naval officer she should technically be a Lieutenant Commander. They also call Shirley a Lieutenant in episode 5, but since she's an officer in her country's Army, she should technically be a Captain. What makes this error more unusual is that the subtitles correctly referred to her as a First Lieutenant in episode 3 (she was promoted off-screen between the two episodes). The actual dialogue averts this, since the characters use the all-forces rank structure of the Imperial Japanese forces ('shousa' being used to refer to both army majors and navy lieutenant commanders, for instance).
<ul><li> To add to the confusion, the Witches in Joint Fighter Wing holds TWO rank. One is for her native country and branch of service she originally is from, which should be addressed by whatever the appropriate title it is for the serving country/branch. And the other is for the League of Nations Air Force (LNAF), which is generally addressed in British Royal Air Force ranks. For example, in a drama CD, Barkhorn states that she is a Shousa (Major) in Karlsland Luftwaffe, but holds the rank of Taii (Captain/Flight Lieutenant) in 501st due to command structure and such.
</li></ul></li><li> The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> mentions the army and National Guard, even though Japan doesn't have an army and National Guard is strictly an American thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> is well known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> of any thing military. It's worth noting Section 9 in most incarnations is not actually a military unit but a special police squad, though Motoko Kusanagi herself is usually a serving JSDF major and Batou a retired Ranger.
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> (1995) film. During Major Kusanagi's battle with the tank, just before the helicopter pilot covering her departs he says "Over and out" to her.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> episode "Jungle Cruise" has Section 9 tracking down a serial killer who is implied to be an ex-US Navy SEAL. The dialogue mentions he was a petty officer (an enlisted rank) while his photo shows him wearing a very good officer uniform.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise">Ghost in the Shell: Arise</a></em> manga follows the established canon of Batou being a Ranger during his JSDF days, it nevertheless makes him a JMSDF Commander,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hh73');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hh73" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hh73');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Also ironically making him outrank his own next CO by a full grade: just remember Motoko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">iconic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorlyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorlyAwesome">nickname</a>.</span> but the only Ranger unit in the modern JSDF, the Western Army Infantry Regiment, explicitly falls under a JGSDF command, even though its soldiers are essentially Marines.
</li></ul></li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarineCorpsYumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarineCorpsYumi">Marine Corps Yumi</a></em>, thanks to the experiences of writer and translator Moreno.
<ul><li> Happens during the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mcyumi.com/manga/marine-corps-yumi-55/">Marine Corp graduation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when the Eagle, Globe and Anchor is not depicted properly. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as that symbol is a trademark of the USMC and the authors opt to not use the actual one in the comics.
</li><li> Moreno also points out any flaw in the depiction of the military in the summary below each page. Such as DIs not being as touchy as depicted and etc.
</li></ul></li><li> In the ending credits of the second volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellsingUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellsingUltimate">Hellsing Ultimate</a></em>, the survivors of the attack on the Hellsing manor salute the dead at their funeral.

<ul><li> The outdated uniforms, weapons, open-bay style barracks, etc. usually stand out to most, and nowadays Sgt. Snorkel would be NJP'd and removed from command of Beetle's platoon for striking a subordinate, if not outright put in the brig for how severely he beats him. Oddly enough, there <em>have</em> been a few strips where Snorkel is thrown in the brig with his stripes ripped off after he does something <em>really</em> stupid (like wreck General Halftrack's car in a fit of rage) but this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">only lasts a day at most.</a>
</li><li> Almost everyone calls Beetle by his nickname (Sgt. Snorkel does almost exclusively). While not completely unheard of, it's essentially his first name (he had the nickname prior to the service) and most nicknames a superior would call you would be something you earned in service. Gen. Halftrack and a few of the Lieutenants do occasionally call him Private Bailey, however.
</li><li> While much of this is intentional (it being a humor strip, after all), the anachronisms are mostly due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSecretLifeOfWalterMitty1947" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSecretLifeOfWalterMitty1947">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a></em>, in a fantasy sequence set on a British airbase, Mitty (Danny Kaye) addresses an RAF officer as "Colonel". There is no such rank in the RAF; the equivalent rank is "Group Captain". Incidentally, the officer is wearing the uniform of an Air Vice-Marshal, equivalent to an Army Lieutenant-General, while Mitty, supposedly a Squadron Leader, wears the uniform of a Group Captain! Perhaps justified in that the protagonist is a daydreaming civilian who's obviously clueless about the subject.
</li><li> At one point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> movie, Colonel O'Neil calls Kawalski, his second in command, "Lieutenant". Not only that, he's credited as "Lieutenant Kawalski" in the credits. The problem? He's wearing silver oak leaves throughout the entire movie, making him a <em>Lieutenant Colonel</em>. While the film's treatment of the military is far from accurate or flattering, that's actually a pretty easy mistake to make. After all, he's a "<em>lieutenant</em> colonel." It can be presumed that Emmerich and Devlin were simply unaware that the appropriate abbreviation of the rank "lieutenant colonel" is not "lieutenant" but rather "colonel." On the other hand, they did get a detail right that even some people in the <em>actual</em> military forget: with the single exception of the sitting President, you do not salute civilians. After the final battle, the Abydonian boys salute O'Neil. You can tell he wants to salute back, but instead he waits until his own men join in so he can salute <em>them</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>
<ul><li> Many characters wear patches from every branch of the military <em>except</em> the Navy.
</li><li> The most famous instance laughed at by real Navy pilots is the buzzing of the control tower. A real pilot doing this would be grounded (most likely permanently) and up on disciplinary charges. That's an INCREDIBLY reckless and dangerous thing to do.
</li><li> Any pilot/aviator who is described as playing by his own rules and disregarding authority would not be put in the seat of a multi-million dollar jet.
</li><li> A pilot who turns in his wings is permanently disqualified from ever flying again.
</li><li> Minor, but pilots (officers) would have their own private quarters for showering and not the open bay locker rooms shown in the movie.
</li><li> Instances of 1st class petty officers in dress whites serving coffee to officers while underway onboard a carrier border between the strange and the ridiculous. One, wardroom personnel on "cranking" duty would be very junior personnel. Two, they would almost never be required to wear dress uniforms in such duties; since they're working in the wardrooms and the galleys, they'd only get dirty for no good reason. Three, they're serving coffee. Every Navy man from admiral on down knows to get his own goddamn coffee.
</li><li> The Top Gun trophy is an admitted artistic license by the writers. As their technical consultant says on the special features documentary that if there really was a Top Gun trophy nobody would graduate because they'd all die trying to get it.
</li><li> Tom Cruise's character rides his motorcycle on base without wearing a helmet. No one on a military installation would get fifty feet like that without getting stopped. A pilot would be in special trouble; it takes a lot of money to train one, and the Navy (and Air Force) doesn't want to have wasted that money just because the pilot didn't want to wear a helmet.
</li><li> One thing they notably did get right was at the insistence of the US Navy. Kelly McGillis' character was originally supposed to be an enlisted sailor. The producers changed her to a civilian in order to secure the cooperation of the Navy in the making of the film, since as a commissioned officer Maverick wouldn't be remotely allowed to date her otherwise.

<ul><li> A female soldier wearing a Ranger tab. There were no Ranger-qualified females at the time (or female Rangers, for that matter).
</li><li> The rank of Samuel L. Jackson's character changed (up and down) depending on the scene.
</li></ul></li><li> Damon Wayans is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">much too young to have served in Vietnam</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorPayne">Major Payne</a></em>, and also would been at least a colonel by the mid 90s, if not retired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RollingThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RollingThunder">Rolling Thunder</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Major Rane puts his Air Force uniform on, his U.S. lapel insignia not only are in the wrong location, but are the insignia used by enlisted personnel, not officers. Similarly, despite the character supposedly being a Vietnam War veteran, his uniform lacks the Vietnam Campaign Medal (an award given out to every single soldier who served in that war).
</li><li> Master Sergeant Vohden's uniform has a Fifth Army patch on the right sleeve. A patch on the right sleeve indicates that the wearer served with that unit in combat during a previous war or campaign. The Fifth Army last served in battle during World War II. Vohden, as a returning Vietnam War veteran in 1973, would have been only a year or two old during World War II, if he had been born at all.
</li><li> The hair of most of the military personnel shown in the film, including that of Major Rane and Master Sergeant Vohden, is too long for military standards.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagleII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronEagleII">Iron Eagle II</a></em> features rather rotund actor Maury Chaykin as a sarcastic, back-talking sergeant who wanders through the entire movie with his uniform unbuttoned, his hair uncombed (and too long for the military), and generally looking like a slob.

<ul><li> Rafe wears an Eagle Squadron badge, as do the Spitfires. The squadron code 'RF' is for No. 303 Squadron, which was a Polish unit - a very famous one at that. The only Hurricane seen in the film has the correct codes for an Eagle Squadron, 'XR-T' for No. 71 Squadron.
</li><li> Rafe claims that he was assigned to an RAF Eagle Squadron prior to American involvement by order of Jimmy Doolittle, but he's lying. In reality, active duty personnel could not be assigned to serve with a belligerent nation while the US was neutral. They would have to resign their USAAF commission, swear allegiance to the British Crown, and enlist in the RAF (usually via Canada). The problem is why Danny believed this excuse.
</li><li> The Doolittle Raiders scene is "how not to be the military".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main sonar technician wears the "crow" of a Petty Officer but is addressed as "Seaman Jones" more than once. The proper forms of address would be either "Petty Officer Jones" or "Petty Officer" by those unfamiliar with his rate, or "STS2" by those who know, by rate being vastly more likely. Possibly "Jones" either by superiors or less formally. Even odder is the fact that, in the book and the movie, he's supposed to be a Sonarman 2nd (later 1st) Class.
</li><li> The film and book depict the eponymous sub's "caterpillar" propulsion system as a revolutionary technological advance because it is much quieter than a traditional screw-propeller system. The problem is that the loudest thing on a nuclear submarine, and thus the one most likely to be picked by opposing passive sonar systems, is the reactor. The reactors on Soviet subs were particularly loud as compared to those on American subs. So it really wouldn't matter how quiet the <em>Red October</em>'s propulsion system is: as long as it's being powered by a nuclear reactor, American subs would have been able to hear it. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the real concern over stealthy (well, stealthier) submarines comes from an older technology: diesel-electrics. Since diesel-electric submarines only use their diesel motors when on the surface and rely solely on battery power, which is extremely quiet because there are no moving parts, when submerged, they are much stealthier than a nuclear submarine. They are also much slower when submerged and can only stay submerged for limited periods of time, which is why nuclear power has generally been considered a big advance.
</li><li> This may or may not be true, but Ramius probably would not tell his officers that they "are dismissed" after eating a meal, since that would be insulting to a Soviet naval officer. Instead, he would say something like "gentlemen officers", which would be a hint to get up and leave.
</li><li> The officers of a Russian sub would probably not walk around in parade uniform all the time. In fact, they certainly <em>wouldn't</em>: when the sub is deployed, the regulations require <em>all</em> personnel on the boat, both the officers and the ratings, to wear <a class="urllink" href="http://gallery.greedykidz.net/get/992328/podvodniki_2011_compressed_ed-DSC_2034.jpg?g2_serialNumber=1">the same fatigues<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, distinguished only by their position pip on the left shirt pocket.
</li><li> The whole reason for Ramius to be dissatisfied with the Soviet system is pretty dumb as well. While the Soviet brass <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">more dismissive of their personnel than the US one</a>, the nuclear submarine COs (moreover, a full captain, that is, a colonel equivalent, is a pretty high rank anyway) most emphatically <em>weren't</em> a resource they have had reserves of, and thus they were treated much more carefully than the other soldiers. Another matter is that he simply wouldn't be approved for the position had his superiors had even the slightest doubt in his loyalty. (The book explains this a bit better. While Ramius <em>has</em> irritated the Soviet Navy brass with criticisms of procedure to the point where he's unlikely to be promoted to admiral, his criticisms were all of operational matters, not politics: he was at least outwardly completely loyal to the Party until his wife died from a medical error and the doctor couldn't be prosecuted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">due to his Party connections</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Below" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Below">Below</a></em>, the ghost story is set on a submarine and an incredible amount of artistic license is taken with how roomy the submarine is. Few movies can accurately portray how cramped, crowded, and claustrophobic a submarine is, but this particular submarine is shown to have fairly large rooms, multiple decks, and corridors wide enough for two people to walk comfortably side by side. This was mainly done to allow characters enough room to wander off by themselves so that spooky events could ensue, also its much easier to film in a wider space. Both modern and World War II era submarines are so cramped that all off duty personnel are usually expected to be in their racks so as to stay out of the way of the people on duty. Only the largest "boomers" could even try to approach having this much space.
<ul><li> For contrast watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DasBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DasBoot">Das Boot</a></em> also on a WWII era submarine (Type <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VIIc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VIIc">VI Ic</a> U-Boat in this case). The space is so cramped that officers having dinner are forced to stand up against the nearest bulkhead anytime someone needs to pass through.

Navy OCS candidates refer to their Marine drill instructors as "Sergeant Instructor" (followed by proper rank and last name if referring to a specific instructor rather than the one yelling in your face). In addition, while the United States Army allows the use of "Sergeant" for any NCO from E-5 to E-8, Marine Corps etiquette insists on referring to non-commissioned officers by proper rank, and even though the Army doesn't require them to be called anything by sergeant, E-8s are often referred to as "Master Sergeant" anyway.

<ul><li> As he is leaving after questioning his client, Tom Cruise's Lt. Kaffee turns and says, "Whatever happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?" whereupon Dawson stands up and pointedly shoves his hands in his pockets. Great moment, great scene... except that Marines don't salute indoors, while Navy officers would not expect a salute indoors. (Specifically, in the Navy and USMC, covers (i.e. hats) are not to be worn indoors except for a few rare occasions...and in those branches, you are not supposed to salute without your cover. Therefore, there is a very small chance of saluting indoors for members of those branches of the US military.) Dawson does finally manage to salute Kaffee (again, indoors) at the end of the film. At this point, he is a prisoner whose sentence includes discharge from the service; such individuals are not permitted to salute or return a salute (though Dawson probably knows this and is breaking the rules out of respect).
</li><li> The premise for the entire plot edges on the unfeasible, if only because the personnel details of a junior enlisted Marine would be so far below the paygrade of a full-bird colonel running an entire base that it wouldn't be worth his time and effort to get involved in them directly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9d9oj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9d9oj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9d9oj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That's in fact <em>why</em> there's a chain of command: the colonel commands the lieutenant colonels, who command the captains, who command the lieutenants, who command the non-commissioned officers. It's straightforward delegation</span>. Indeed, his insistence in getting involved in what should have been a very straightforward matter of discipline easily handled by subordinates is what ended up costing him his job and freedom.
</li><li> Additionally, Lt. Kendrick admits on the stand that he had a subordinate punished by depriving him of food for a week. He's not the one on trial, so nothing happens to him. In reality, he would've been immediately arrested and, probably, drummed out for violating the Marine code of conduct.
</li><li> Crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License  Law</a>, there is no such charge as "conduct unbecoming a Marine". "Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman" exists as UCMJ Article 133, but Kaffee's clients are enlisted Marines and can't be charged with it.
<ul><li> That one's a relatively minor mistake because Article 134 (ie. the "General Article") is often used in similar "catch-all" situations for enlisted personnel. Though the charge is usually phrased along the lines of "Bringing discredit to the service."

<ul><li> The Marines are shown saluting officers while in Vietnam. This is a big no-no. You do not salute officers in a war zone because it immediately identifies the officer to the enemy, making them a target. Another error: in the scene with Joker explaining his "Born to Kill" graffito, the officer initiates (just barely, but still) the salute. Wrong: the junior rank initiates the salute, always, in every branch. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">altered</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">the original novel</a> (<em>The Short-Timers</em> by Gustav Hasford, himself a Vietnam veteran): Joker, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Joker</a>, was saluting the officer in a combat zone on purpose - and when explicitly ordered to.

</div><ul><li> In reference to this, saluting in the field is known as a "Sniper Check", and lampshaded by saying it <em>while doing it</em> in an attempt to either discourage newer officers or hasten their replacement.

His character was also much more verbally abusive than any drill instructor would ever be allowed to be.
</li><li> Taking even a <em>single</em> round of ammunition, never mind an entire clip, from the firing range would be next to impossible. Live rounds are only given out at the range, and <em>every</em> round is accounted for: you will be given twenty rounds, someone will stand by you and see that you load <em>and fire</em> twenty rounds. And then there's the continual inspections and searches down to the lint in your pockets: it's not just to teach them an eye for detail and adherence to rules, but also to make sure that recruits don't have anything they shouldn't. But then we wouldn't have the most iconic scene in the film, would we?
</li><li> Like the above, being able to smuggle your weapon into the barracks and bringing it out at night is similarly unlikely in Boot Camp, <em>especially</em> in Boot Camp. Weapons are stored in the unit's Arms Room when they are not being used for operations, training, or maintenance and are <em>only</em> taken out for those purposes before being secured back in the Arms Room afterward, with strict accountability of every single weapon.

It's never stated what his source rate was (back then SEALS were one of 8 regular ratings), so assuming it was one that required a clearance (for instance, if he was a Boatswain's Mate, he could have stayed as one, but not a Photographer's Mate), he still couldn't become a Yeoman, as it requires a secret clearance.

<ul><li> Despite being awarded the Medal of Honor, Steve never wears the appropriate ribbon - possibly justified, since the USO arranged his exemption from the usual regulations regarding his uniform. He also wears an American Defense Medal ribbon which he would not (as an active member of the US Army) have been eligible for.
</li><li> Steve salutes Phillips and then lowers his hand without Phillips ever saluting him back. Military etiquette is that the junior salutes first but holds the salute until it is returned.
</li><li> The way Peggy Carter publicly assaults a soldier would be completely unacceptable in real life, and all the more so when she is a foreigner. If General Patton didn't get away with beating on a GI scot-free, some British secretary certainly isn't going to.

This would be an unacceptable breach of uniform regulations and etiquette for a German officer, <em>but</em> given his attitude towards his fellow Nazis (which got him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>), one assumes that he didn't give a damn whether his uniform was correct or not.

Of course, who's going to court-martial someone who single-handedly rescued 400 POWs?

"Seaman First Class" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> rank, not a contemporary one.
</li><li> In the same book, the Coast Guard cutter <em>Panache</em> has as part of its crew two separate Master Chiefs. For a ship of that size, which would have barely one hundred crew members, <em>one</em> Master Chief would be too many.

The United States Army hasn't promoted anybody to that rank since 1950, and the last one (Omar Bradley) died in 1981; the book is set post-2000 and though the series operates on the rule of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted">Like Reality Unless Noted</a>, there's no clear indication that US military history is really that different within the setting.

In a fictional account of a U.S. Army Sherman tank crew on a mission, the recon platoon leader ends a radio conversation with "Roger, over and out".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN">RCN</a></em> novel <em>When the Tide Rises</em>. Adele Mundy attends a play loosely based on her own ship's mission in the previous book and spends most of the performance complaining about the inaccuracies in the production. These range from uniform mistakes (putting people in the semi-dress 2nd Class uniform when they ought to be in utilities, for example) to the fact that, while the holographic video portion of the performance consists of actual combat images from <em>Princess Cecile</em> (they were sold to the playwright by a crew member, who sent the money to the families of wounded or dead crew), they combine <em>all</em> the battles since the first book rather than just the fight for Dunbar's World.
</li><li> Too many to count in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>. To be clear, the author, one William Lind, is a military theorist who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">wrote the book as much to show his ideas for how leaderless insurgency, clever tactics, light infantry and low-tech conquer all</a> as he did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against all the forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">liberalism</a>. Some examples include:
<ul><li> Live-fire infantry training with offset aim alone preventing casualties, modern warships destroyed with spar torpedoes, Russian T-34s as the ultimate tank design for rear area strikes which are apparently the sole purpose of tanks, antiquated 1950s radar easily spotting stealth bombers, etc. etc. Platoon strength militia units with no logistics or coordination with each other are upheld as vastly superior to existing military, to the point of being called upon to train the actual military. At one point, the protagonist shows his contempt for the established military by sleeping through a briefing containing such useless trivia as local politics, road and weather conditions.
</li><li> Also the hero, John Rumford's, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> as a young US Marine is interrupting a ceremony honoring the Corps' war dead rather than let a female Marine participate. No woman fought at Iwo Jima, he insists, so no woman has a right to speak the words and honor the dead. In reality, women have been a part of the USMC since 1918, served in combat areas since Vietnam, and as of the story's beginning have been full and equal parts of all save small unit ground combat for over twenty years. There are no male, female, white, black etc. Marines, only Marines. Besides, disrupting a remembrance ceremony is <em>far</em> more disrespectful than any imagined slight. Exactly none of these points come up when his CO chews him out and he gets discharged, only that a congresswoman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">hounding him to be inclusive.</a> If anything, his fellow Marines seem to respect his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantStoneThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantStoneThrow">stand</a> on the issue.
</li><li> Crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License  History</a>, Rumford also asserts that no army that has included female front-line combatants has ever been successful. Hilariously considering the book's above-mentioned idolization of the T-34, the same war that produced said very fine tank also saw the Soviets field female snipers, machine-gunners, <em>tank crew</em>, and combat pilots, the latter including <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Witches">a very famous all-female bomber regiment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In all, ninety women received the Gold Star Medal and the title Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II, most for service in front-line combat.

<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> showed a wedding of a young Navy ensign. He and all his buddies were in choker whites, sporting impossible ribbon racks full of awards they couldn't have earned, some for wars they were infants for, along with warfare devices they couldn't have gotten yet (dual Surface AND Subsurface Warfare Pins)... not bad for being in the Navy less than two years!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> is a serious offender. Buster seems to be in and out of boot camp whenever it's plot convenient, and the uniforms (when not grossly inaccurate) were out of date by about seven years. Not to mention you wouldn't get a medal for getting injured from a non combat accident, and tricking someone into reenlisting is highly illegal. Given the show lives by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, most of the inaccuracies are probably intentional.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series tends to portray "cruisers" as midsize warships and "destroyers" as large warships, in a reverse of historical norms.
</li><li> The series has some problems with Earthforce naval ranks. The uniforms in the series are pretty clear: blue for naval personnel, gray for security, olive drab for ground forces. However, <em>General</em> William Hague and <em>Major</em> Ed Ryan are both apparently naval officers and wear blue, whereas the rest of the cast follow the standard NATO naval rank system.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> Goes Forth</em>, whilst generally fairly accurate on many uniform and insignia aspects (excepting the fact they are dressed perfectly accurately for 1914, not 1917!), has an easily missed error in the form of Brigadier-General Sir Bernard Proudfoot-Smith. The rank title is in fact correct for the era (it's currently just Brigadier, without the hyphened General, in the British Army). His insignia is, however, incorrect: Brigadier-General during WWI wore a crossed baton and sword (similar to other generals, but without any crowns or stars above).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> A Ranger Colonel shows up to recruit Booth to train soldiers in Afghanistan. He immediately recognizes the Colonel as an army ranger, presumably due to the 75th Ranger patch on his right shoulder. Instead of a flag (argh!). Also, the Colonel is wearing a (deformed) black beret instead of the Ranger tan.
</li><li> Agent Booth himself at the end of the same episode counts as well. Wearing a presumably new uniform that looks like it came from the "reject" pile of the local CIF. Would be an aversion except that Booth has been reinstated to the rank of Sergeant Major and would at least ensure his uniform was presentable.

In one episode Riley refers to his colleagues as soldiers, in the next they are Marines. (There are some implications the Initiative is a unit all its own, and that personnel from all branches have been transferred there due to being deemed suitable for the program, but noting definitive.) Others use the terms interchangeably to refer to Riley. They answer to a civilian at first, but then are taken over by a general. Insignia seems to have been chosen by grabbing stuff at random and pinning it on wherever it would fit. Though they do avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> by being very well disciplined with a clear chain of command.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> has attempted to explain all this by saying that the Initiative was a civilian agency that used active duty soldiers from multiple military services simultaneously, and that any military personnel put in charge were doing so on a... well... you get the idea.

</li><li> An episode of <em>Destroyed in Seconds</em> had footage from a helicopter crash during a Russian airshow. The helicopters were Mi-2s, but the narrator continuously refers to them as "M1-2s". The narrator then calls them "state-of-the-art". They aren't, having been introduced in 1965 and phased out of front-line service in most armies which field them, including Russia's.

<ul><li> We'll start with New Doctor Who's 'saluting while not wearing hats' (if you are hatless, you can come to attention, or a version of it if sitting down, when wishing to show respect to a superior officer within most Commonwealth countries). Yes, it means that the Doctor can do his 'no don't salute' bit, but would it cost them too much to borrow the hats?

<ul><li> Rory, dressed in civilian clothes, salutes the NASA personal in 1969 with the British-styled salute. The NASA personnel are explicitly confused by his usage of the British salute, so it's certainly an in universe example.
</li><li> President Nixon leans on the NASA employees to keep quiet because he is their "Commander in Chief". Commander in Chief refers to his position as being in charge of all US Armed Forces, but NASA was (and is) a civilian federal agency. Possibly said as a shorthand as the President is technically the ultimate boss of any federal agency.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E7ThePyramidAtTheEndOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E7ThePyramidAtTheEndOfTheWorld">"The Pyramid at the End of the World"</a>: The colonel in charge of the American military contingent is wearing the rank insignia of a four-star general.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>. Captain Jack Harkness' greatcoats all bear the rank insignia of "Group Captain", which is a full title in itself, is never referred to as "Captain", and has the equivalent of "Colonel" in the armed forces. Not to mention the fact that in his first appearance, his uniform is that of a "Squadron Leader". Possibly justified, as he originally stole the identity in question, and while he probably figured it out later, he's shown to be very attached to his greatcoat, rank insignia and all, so probably doesn't care.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor">Enemy at the Door</a></em>, set during World War II, most of the recurring German characters are in the Wehrmacht (regular military), but Reinicke is an officer of the Waffen-SS (which had a separate command structure and its own ranks). Early episodes aren't consistent about recognising that the SS had different ranks from the regular army, with Reinicke frequently addressed or referred to with the army rank of "Hauptmann" instead of the SS rank of "Hauptsturmführer".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> episode "The Arrival", a photo is shown of a Marine from an incident in 1987. Not only is he wearing digital camouflage, which was not introduced to the Marine Corps until the early 2000s, but it's ACU instead of MARPAT. What the Marine should be wearing are BDUs.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> episode "Chicken or Beef," at Dean Forester's bachelor party, one of his friends, Kyle, is shown to have enlisted in the Navy and is wearing his Dress Blues uniform. While the character has graduated high school just months prior, his uniform is that of an E-5 and has two hash marks on the left sleeve. It would be impossible for a high school graduate to obtain this rank in a matter of months, but more to the point the hashmarks on his sleeve mean Kyle has been enlisted for between 8 and 12 years (one hash mark indicates four years of service).
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em> shows Colonel Klink (who's in charge of Stalag 13) initiating the salute. As mentioned above, that's not how it works. Then again, all the Germans on the show are idiots.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> the research and accuracy became better through the years the show was running, though inaccuracies could always be found. Having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marine Corps</a> veteran as its creator, executive producer, and show runner probably helped. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon">Backed by the Pentagon</a> probably helped a great deal too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em>, in a rare in-universe example. U.S. Marines come to help rebuild and resupply the town. A former Army Ranger notices details that are wrong; one calls an NCO 'sir', they say 'hooah' (Army) rather than 'oorah' (Marines). They are simply civilians wearing uniforms and using the town's resources.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> has too many to count, but a few stand out above the others:
<ul><li> Frank demands and receives a Purple Heart for getting an eggshell in his eye during an artillery barrage. In real life, he would have been denied as the injury wasn't directly caused by enemy action. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">The episode actually addressed this point</a>: Frank wouldn't have been eligible for the medal, but the injury was entered into his records as "shell fragment in eye", which happened during an artillery attack on the unit, which got the medal approved by I Corps, which presumed it was an artillery shell fragment instead of an eggshell. Note that Hawkeye was not amused at the trickery and how it cheated the value of the medal to injured soldiers that came through the 4077th. So, not an error on the writer's part; an error on the Army's part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>.
</li><li> Potter is correct in stating that the Army Good Conduct Medal is only for enlisted soldiers. He's wrong in insisting that his status as a prior-service enlisted soldier entitles him to wear the medal, which he is seen wearing from time to time and he has his medal framed on his wall. What he (or the writers) failed to realize is that the medal was awarded long after Potter was an enlisted soldier and that the retroactive dates don't go back to when he was enlisted and eligible for the award.
</li><li> At one point Hawkeye and BJ try to take Corporal O'Reilly into an officers-only area with them. Hawkeye plucks a pair of captain's bars from BJ's shoulder, attaches it to Radar's cap, and (inspired by the ranks of lieutenant-colonel and sergeant-major) declares him a "corporal-captain". And this <em>works</em>. They only had to convince one suspicious officer (though this itself is unlikely) and given that he was in the club, he'd likely enough to believe their story of the Army seeking opinions on a possible new rank.
</li><li> 1970s shaggy hair and sideburns is and was completely out of Army regulations, almost all CIVILIAN men at the time kept their hair much shorter than that. Now given, the writer of the original book said conscripted surgeons in the war got away with ridiculous things because of the scarcity, it wouldn't explain the regular and career soldiers for the reasons above. During Colonel Blake's tenure as CO the failure of the enlisted men to observe regulation grooming standards can be explained as 'since the commanding officer didn't care about the regulations, nobody bothered following them' (after all, if there's one constant thing about the military it's that if the CO consistently lets something slide, the troops will happily slide on it as far as they can get away with), but one of Colonel Potter's character elements was that he actually was "regular Army" in mindset re: enlisted discipline.
</li><li> Now given that the time scale for the 12 year series doesn't really fit into a three year conflict anyway, but most conscripted surgeons only served a year in country. Hawkeye is apparently there throughout the entire conflict.
</li><li> Occasionally, references are given to "points," which a draftee accumulates in order to determine his time-in-service; Trapper is sent home after accumulating enough points, and a racist combat unit commander volunteers his black troops for dangerous missions in order to accumulate points faster and rotate them out of his unit. This refers to a system used for WWII which was discontinued by the time of the Korean War, and never applied to medical personnel in any case.
<ul><li> According the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-stale/stale.htm">U.S. Army Center of Military History<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a soldier earned four points for every month he served in close combat, two points per month for rear-echelon duty in Korea, and one point for duty elsewhere in the Far EastThe Army initially stated that enlisted men needed to earn forty-three points to be eligible for rotation back to the States, while officers required fifty-five points. In June 1952 the Army reduced these requirements to thirty-six points for enlisted men and thirty-seven points for officers.

To stay aboard the sub, Lucas asks Hudson if he can stay if he enlists into the navy. Hudson agrees, and Lucas is given the rank of ensign. That's right, a civilian scientist with no military experience is immediately given an officer rank and starts serving aboard the sub without even having to go through bootcamp.

<ul><li> Watson's backstory in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">British Army</a>. He states on several occasions that he is from the "5th Northumberland Fusiliers". The unit name is a carryover from the original Doyle stories. Watson served with the 5th (Northumberland Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Maiwand in 1880. The regiment was renamed simply to 'Northumberland Fusiliers' in 1881, but was frequently referred to as the "5th Northumberland" for decades thereafter. The regiment became part of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, before the current John Watson was even born. Additionally, he was a surgeon - not a normal soldier - so he should really be saying he's from the Royal Army Medical Corps.
</li><li> "The Hounds of Baskerville" features Major Barrymore, an officer with a full beard, which is not allowed by British Army regulations. Barrymore had a beard in the original story and in every other adaptation, which undoubtedly is the reason for his beard in <em>Sherlock</em>.
<ul><li> British Army regulations do allow the wearing of a beard if there is a serious medical or religious reason (e.g., skin condition prevents shaving or the soldier is a devout Sikh) or 'operational reasons' as decided by a sufficiently high ranking officer (e.g., patrolling in the desert for weeks and there's not enough water for shaving). Of course none of these are mentioned or obvious in the episode so Artistic License is the most likely explanation.
</li></ul></li><li> The extras in "The Hounds of Baskerville" are also clearly overage, and do not wear uniforms correctly.
</li><li> Sherlock refers to the soldier who asks him and Watson for help as a Grenadier. The problem is that the soldier is actually serving in the Scots Guard and all <em>OR1s</em> (typically called privates) in Foot Guard regiments are addressed as <em>Guardsman</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoldierSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoldierSoldier">Soldier Soldier</a></em> had to fudge things around the edges; it couldn't depict any genuine British infantry regiment, so wholly fictitious ones, with plausible back histories, had to be invented.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> had an episode where several sailors can be seen in the escort services house in dress whites. Where exactly their ship pulled in is never really explained. Given they're in uniform it would imply it's Fleet Week, which would be in San Francisco. Seems like a long way to go for a whore house...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Cooper Hawkes</a> ends up getting arrested due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and a misunderstanding with the police after a group of thugs try to hang him in an alleyway. The judge sentences him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes">serve his debt to society via military service</a>... by putting him through a commissioning program to become a space fighter pilot in the Marine Corps. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> even goes so far as to describe the entire situation as a cruel prank played at his (the drill sergeant's) expense. While the US military <em>did</em> do this in the past, A) they only recruited enlisted men this way, not officers, and B) they officially ended this practice several decades before the series was <em>made</em>, never mind set. Hawkes would have had to obtain a waiver after the fact; he most certainly would not have been shipped from jail still in a prison jumpsuit and shackles. Besides which, becoming an officer in the US military requires a college degree (whether from a civilian university or a service academy).
</li><li> The military had long since abandoned the issue of sending letters to inform families of their dead loved ones. Appropriately, to avoid exactly the sort of situation Nathan finds himself in one episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His parents not getting the letter and still believing his brother is alive the episode after he was killed in action.</span>
</li><li> No, Colonel McQueen, the real Marine Corps does <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingSoldier">routinely send AcePilot naval aviators in as infantrymen</a> (the 58th actually complains about this in one episode). Despite the Marine creed that every Marine is first a rifleman, that would be a stupid risk of very expensively trained officers. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">deconstructed</a> in "Sugar Dirt" when the 58th leaving their fighters under orders to join a ground attack results in them getting shot up on the runway.
</li><li> In the pilot, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">(supposedly) elite</a> Angry Angels squadron wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform">custom uniforms</a> and berets. This is frowned upon by the Marine Corps: official policy is that all Marines are the same, to the point where they've even abolished unit patches.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a></em>
<ul><li> Mostly averted, although there were some uniform oddities that popped up now and then, most notably an airman in the pilot wearing the insignia for both a Staff Sergeant and a Major. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon">officially endorsed by the U.S. Air Force</a>, and had military advisers on board to avoid most flagrant mistakes (they would reportedly even complain if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandaTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandaTapping">Amanda Tapping</a> let her hair grow longer than regulation in her role as Samantha Carter).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> pilot episode also saw such flagrant errors as salutes given while indoors (you don't salute a superior while indoors), and a Captain reporting to a Colonel while in the same room as a General. (The Captain would have reported to the General, as he was the highest ranking officer in the room.)
</li><li> While U.S Air Force soldiers are depicted rather accurately, the same cannot be said for the Russian forces we see on the show. This is most prominently displayed in "The Tomb", which is chock full of inaccuracies. For starters, the Russian Stargate team are stated to be from the Russian Air Force, which unlike the U.S Air Force, does not have any ground troops. It's possible that a writer mistook the Russian Airborne Troops (Vozdushno-desantnye voyska Rossii, or VDV) for members of the Air Force. They are also shown wearing black berets, as opposed to the blue berets of the VDV, one of their most distinctive uniform features, while black berets are worn by Naval Infantry, Russian tank troops and the now-defunct OMON special police unit.
</li><li> The Air Force throughout the franchise is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">remarkably effective at defending its dominance of the program</a>, considering that even after the introduction of the F-302 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighter</a> and BC-303 and -304 battlecruisers, most of their missions are ground warfare operations for which the other branches are more known. Realistically Stargate Command would be much more of a joint operation: while the Air Force would probably still be in charge given that space is part of its remit, there would probably be a lot more Army and Marine Corps personnel going offworld than are present in the series, since Air Force special forces troops are more organized around supporting air combat operations than directly attacking the enemy. The same issue applies to Jack O'Neill's backstory as a special warfare operator: he's shown conducting (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> recreation of) a mole-extraction mission in East Germany, something for which they most likely wouldn't have used an Air Force team in reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> A character is consistently identified as a Sergeant despite wearing the rank insignia of a Senior Airman. This is sort-of understandable, as modern-day Senior Airmen in the USAF wear the same rank insignia that Sergeants did back when the Air Force rank of "Sergeant" existed. That USAF rank was eliminated in 1991 (it was at the same paygrade as a Senior Airman anyways) and the insignia repurposed.
</li><li> The 20-year old <em>Master Sergeant</em> Ronald Greer. Master Sergeant is a rank that requires at least 16 years prior experience, meaning Greer could not possibly have reached that rank at his age, unless we assume some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> or time dilation plot went on behind the scenes. This being both <em>Stargate</em> and a more serial show than even <em>SG-1</em> was in later seasons, this seems unlikely... <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11o97y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11o97y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11o97y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The character of Greer, originally named Ron "Psycho" Stasiak, was conceived as a man in his 30s, a more realistic age for that rank, but when Jamil Walker Smith was cast the role was rewritten somewhat. The rank was not among the changes.</span>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, costumes often did not match stated ranks, and there would be some confusion over what rank a character held. The only character to receive a promotion during the run of the series is Spock, who starts out as a Lieutenant Commander and is promoted to full Commander at some indeterminate point in the first season. However, he wears the two-braided shirt, denoting a full Commander, throughout. Many other characters described in dialogue as a Lieutenant Commander also wear the two braids of a full Commander. There is also no real distinction in costuming between junior officers and enlisted crewmen.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12isei');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12isei" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12isei');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although you might expect that officers would wear tunic shirts and crewmen would wear jumpsuits, there are far too many exceptions to this "rule of thumb" for it to be meaningful.</span>

<ul><li> Usually averted. <em>DS9</em> does manage to keep everyone's ranks straight, even the Army style ranks of the Bajoran military. The only gray area is Chief O'Brien<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13shdy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13shdy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13shdy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He started on TNG as an unnamed ensign assigned to conn and went all over the chart from there. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Miles_O%27Brien#Problematic_Rank_History">Memory Alpha has the full list.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> By '95 they finally decided he was a Senior Chief Petty Officer, where he stayed (and he was eventually even given a unique noncom's rank patch instead of the gold pins worn by officers, clearly based on real-life petty officers' insignia).</span>, but even he is consistently recognized as a specialist officer (NCO/Warrant) rather than a commissioned Starfleet officer, allowing him to, among other things, avoid getting in dress uniform and going to formal occasions a few times.
</li><li> Occasionally you see the Chief chew out an Ensign for screwing up an engineering task (he's still respectful about it), which some people complain about. This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>: If you're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">Ensign Newbie</a> and your commanding officer has placed you on work detail with a decorated CPO whose job designation is Chief Operations Officer, he's allowed to chew you out over your failures with the engineering. Indeed, in some military services, mentoring inexperienced officers was one of the duties of senior NCOs, given their experience. Another point about his rank was actually <em>brought up</em> by the character: when Nog is accepted to Starfleet Academy, O'Brien muses that if Nog ever makes ensign he's going to have to start calling the kid <em>sir</em>.
</li><li> Season seven's "Field of Fire" has Ezri Dax refer to a bit character as "not the first drunken ensign I've escorted home".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14xl9e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14xl9e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14xl9e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This presumably in reference to Ben Sisko, who was friends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">Curzon Dax</a> as a junior officer.</span> However, the character's rank insignia, one gold pin and one black pin, is that of a junior grade lieutenant (and he's correctly referred to as a lieutenant in the preceding scene).
</li></ul></li><li> In the "Equinox" two-parter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, Captains Janeway and Ransom are momentarily confused over who's in charge since they're of equal rank, as though it's something that doesn't happen. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the method that's been followed for centuries is plain, simple seniority—whoever was promoted first calls the shots. Starfleet's own regulations essentially boil down to "whoever has the more badass ship," which isn't unreasonable, but despite being stranded neither captain should be acting like this is something that requires a deep dive into the rule book, because they've both been in Starfleet long enough that they'd have witnessed or experienced it back home.
<ul><li> Actually "who's commanding more combat-capable unit" could be a criterion - in case when seniority was not clearly established within the pre-existing chain of command - in many real-world militaries. What does not make sense here that they had not known the rule as a matter of fact. Chalk it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> nature of the Starfleet.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare">"Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02)</a>, the Army's military police are shown investigating a crime scene on a Navy base instead of the Shore Patrol or NCIS. (For that matter, Army MPs would not be doing major crime scene work; that's what Army CID (Criminal Investigation Division) does.)

When Colonel Cook's superior General Larrabee ends his radio communication with Cook, he says "Over to you, and out", an example of incorrect radio protocol.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome">Under the Dome</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode mistakenly describes and depicts the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_MOAB">MOAB bomb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a missile instead of a bomb. It's also unlikely that the MOAB would be used to destroy a hard target such as the dome, since it's a fuel-air device designed to airburst and demolish softer targets over a wide area. (In the original novel the scene involved a tactical nuke.)
</li><li> It can probably be forgiven for being a dream sequence, but when the one woman sees her Navy husband coming home from deployment, walking down the street, he's wearing a discontinued working uniform and wouldn't be authorized to wear it off base/ship anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The White House received weather forecasts from a Coast Guard 1st Lieutenant. The Coast Guard equivalent to this Army/Air Force/Marine Corps rank is Lieutenant (Junior Grade).
</li><li> The Army Chief of Staff is portrayed as a three-star general. During peacetime, the job is always held by someone with four-star rank. (During wartime, it can also be held by a five-star; in the US, such ranks are used only in wartime.)
</li><li> Aaron Sorkin in general seemed to have difficulty with military matters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>. He turned heat-seeking air-to-air missiles into radar-seeking air-to-ground missiles, and throughout West Wing's run talks about "Battle Carrier Groups" rather than "Carrier Battle Groups"... to name but a few. (This general ignorance is often expressed through the president, who typically plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a> to the Joint Chiefs.)
</li><li> In the first season episode "The State Dinner" a carrier battle group is stuck in the path of a hurricane. The naval officer who briefs the president on it tells him that it consists of "the USS <em>John Kennedy</em>, two guided missile cruisers, two destroyers, and two battleships." This is pretty remarkable, considering the Navy retired its last battleships a few years before the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, the second half of the fifth season has some plot points that revolve around whether or not a reporter is making up details in his stories. As part of his stories, he interviews a former Marine who served in Iraq. When the reporter first meets the Marine, the Marine talks about an "M niner niner eight", which (he explains) is a Humvee. He also calls a .50 caliber machine gun an <em>M50</em> (which is actually an M2). Later, the Marine's credibility is called into question. Even a fellow Marine is questioned on the subject. In the second interview, the Marine correctly identifies the machine gun as a .50 caliber machine gun, but the audience is supposed to be left with the notion that the former Marine is a credible source of information, despite a few mistakes in his story.

A 21-gun salute is done with artillery pieces, not rifles, and is reserved for the funeral of a former or current president. The salute performed at soldiers' funerals is referred to as a three-volley salute and never has 21 shooters involved. It's possible Gilbert decided "21 guns blazing" was better rhythmically.

<ul><li> The Marine Base Commanders wear the scarlet and gold shoulder chevrons of a First Sergeant (on the utility uniform, no less), are always saluted and addressed as "sir", and, when they are given names, have varying officer ranks.
</li><li> There are also errors in the equipment used by the Marines. They use UH-60 Blackhawks, M2 Bradley APCs and AH-64 helicopter gunships. These should be UH-1 Venoms, LAV-25s or AAV-7s and the AH-1 Super Cobra respectively. Even though one could handwave this by saying they are U.S Army attachments, they are all specifically stated to be Marine vehicles, including by the Marines themselves.
</li><li> The final battle takes place on-board the USS <em>Ronald Reagan</em>, a US Navy aircraft carrier operating about a mile off the coast of Manhattan and launching Apache helicopters. In real life, the <em>Reagan</em> is part of the US Pacific Fleet, and wouldn't be involved in an operation on the East Coast. Aircraft carriers also don't operate that close to land, not only because they don't have to but also so they have room to change speed and orientation for flight operations. AH-64s would not operate off a carrier, because the Navy has more than enough of its own aircraft that it needs the space for.
</li></ul></li><li> The Aircraft Carrier level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> is incredibly groan inducing to anyone who has ever served in the US Navy or knows anything about Naval Ranks. The fact that none of the ranks or uniforms make any sense points to a blatant case of not even bothering to skim the Wikipedia article. The Carrier CVN-80 being named the USS Constitution is also unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, being that the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uss_constitution">original ship<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> bearing that name is still in commission.

However, at the end of the level, the players are desperately searching for a lifeboat to get off the carrier...despite the fact that you run past <em>dozens</em> of lifeboats clearly visible in the background graphics. One wonders if they game designers simply didn't know what they were (the large pill-shaped things around the lifelines) or just ignored them for plot purposes.

At the age of 23. Two problems here: 1) the Unit (as it is often called) recruits only from the most experienced members from the Special Forces<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15s4nk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15s4nk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15s4nk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As in, United States Army Special Forces, more commonly known as Green Berets</span> and Army Rangers, neither of which admitted women to their ranks at the time of writing (much less in 1998). 2) Even if one assumes that women can be Berets or Rangers in the RE-verse, becoming a Delta operator becomes somewhere around ten to twelve years; Jill would have to be at least 32. Later games dodge this by simply listing Jill's skills and abilities without going into which branch of the military she was trained in, while the novelization states that Jill learned her skills from her father, a cat burglar.
</li><li> Chris Redfield, meanwhile, is stated to be former U.S Air Force, where he served as a pilot. However, background material from the first game also states that he served as a "marksman", which would be under the purview of a dedicated ground-service branch such as the Air Force Pararescue service, and it would be extremely unusual for someone to have combat experience as such while also serving as a fixed-wing pilot. Chris is also stated to have experience flying VTOL's, which during the era that Chris served would have only consisted of the Harrier Jump Jet, which were exclusive to the Marines.

<ul><li> The HECU medical personnel are referred to, both in-universe and out, as medics. The U.S. Marines, which make up the HECU's foot soldiers, do not use medics. They have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">corpsmen</a>, who are actually from the Navy and have been specially trained to work and fight alongside the Marines.
</li><li> Although they're identified as marines, HECU soldiers deploy various types of military hardware that are not used by U.S. Marines in real life, including U.S. Army's M2 Bradley IFVs (real-world marines use LAV-25) and AH-64 Apache helicopters (real-world marines use AH-1W Super Cobras), as well as U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters (real-world marines use AV-8B Harrier II fighters).
</li><li> Averted with their individual uniforms, the HECU uses a white-and-grey camouflage with a green vest.

<ul><li> The original game had a major become an admiral. That's not even trying.
</li><li> <em>EV Nova</em> may have an example with General Smart, a Federation officer who defected to the Rebels and is now in charge of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">space navy</a>. The Federation Navy appears to use US Navy ranks (the two named Federation officers, Krane and Raczak, are a commander and an admiral respectively), so the only way to resolve it is by having the Rebels use Army or Air Force ranks. Given that the Rebels are of Federation extraction, this seems unlikely. There <em>is</em> a potential explanation, but it may be giving the creators too much credit — General Smart could be a <em>marine</em> officer who defected (outside the USA, it is fairly common for marines to be a branch of the navy but use army ranks, and just because the Federation uses US ranks doesn't mean it is organized like the US military).
</li><li> Justifiable as it's more a way of keeping score, but in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XWing">X-Wing</a></em> games, your character's rank is a function of their game score. So if you perform well enough (or use exploits and other tricks to pad your score), your character can be a general being ordered about by fleet captains (about equal to a colonel) or even fighter lieutenants in the early game.

<ul><li> In the games set in America, the army should technically not be allowed to go after the player character - The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of the US Military as a law enforcement agency.

Generally, the military won't come after you if you're not near Fort Zancudo. Take a police chase to the vicinity of the base, or trespass or begin causing trouble in there, and you can bet that you'll be perforated by machine gun fire, tank rounds and a few air to ground missiles for good measure.

Which would still be incorrect for the time period, the sailors would be wearing the classic dungarees.
<ul><li> Minor, but there is no LHD 69 either (only USS Wasp (LHD 1) was in service at the time too), but of course this is GTA, so what other hull designator would it be?

<ul><li> Welkin's unit in the first game is very forgiving of uniform alterations; includes older, more experienced troops answering to a rookie commander younger than them; and includes numerous individuals who struggle or refuse to work properly together. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">It's also a civilian militia activated on short notice under Gallia's Universal Conscription laws</a>. The enlisted armed forces are much better about it, wearing uniform and addressing each other according to rank.
</li><li> The second game focuses on a class at the military college, and while the player's unit is explicitly the dumping ground for applicants that scraped into admission but fit nowhere else, there's generally a lot more discipline.
</li><li> While all three games have the player in command of a <em>platoon</em>-sized unit (15-30 people), the game always refer to them as <em>squads</em> (8-12 people). This is a mistake by the English translators: in the original Japanese the player's unit is correctly referred to as <em>shotai</em> (platoon).

It also inconveniences the developers in the event they ever want to raise the level cap again: the increase in rank cap to fleet admiral resulted in jokes that the next expansion would make you President of the Federation.
</li><li> Miral Paris is a Starfleet security officer, which according to the game's conventions means she should be wearing red coloring on her uniform: red is for security and tactical personnel, as well as commanding officers and admirals. For some reason they have her in yellow, which is for operations and engineering specialties (though it included security personnel in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> timeframe, which was when her mother served as an engineering officer; this is possibly a misplaced use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a>). Season 10 makes the same error in the opposite direction by putting Sarish Minna, Deep Space 9's operations officer, in a red security/tactical uniform.

Second, the only way to be dishonorably discharged is to be court martialed, as Homer clearly was not.

Using common naval ranks, this would actually be considered a <strong>demotion</strong>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommonRanks">commander</a> is a rank <em>below</em> a naval captain, which is equivalent to an army colonel. The viewer would rather expect him to be a commodore, the somewhat similar-sounding rank which is the real intermediate step between captain and the flag ranks (i.e., admirals of all persuasions) in the British (and older American) naval tradition. However, certain obscure European navies do exist in real life in which the rank of commander (or its cognate in their languages) <em>is</em> senior to that of captain, so this is not <em>necessarily</em> an error.
<ul><li> Or, it could be intended that he is now "Captain Zhao, Commander, Force/Station [Insert-Here]," meaning simply that he has a new command, signifying that specific appointment rather than a promotion in rank (though his dialogue as given would be a clumsy way to express that by real life standards). The size of his command, which includes multiple capital ships, is in any case one that would mandate roughly commodore's (if not rear admiral's) rank in real life, with a captain typically commanding only a single major warship.
</li></ul></li><li> While the Enforcers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> are an entirely fictional organization, and more like highly militarized police than actual military, there's still a few noteworthy issues:
<ul><li> The Enforcers' leader, Ulysses Feral, is stated to be a commander. However, in "The Wrath of Dark Kat," he addresses a subordinate as "Captain." The "captain" is a generic Enforcer pilot with no discerning rank insignia. Also, in real life, captains usually outrank commanders.
</li><li> Lieutenant Commander Steel is almost always addressed as "Lieutenant," except by himself and on his nameplate. The correct shortened form of address for a lieutenant commander is "commander." Steel is likely addressed as Lieutenant in order to avoid confusion with Feral.
</li><li> Sergeant Talon and most of the other generic sergeants have shoulderboards with one gold stripe apiece, almost identical to that of Lt. Commander Steel. The only real difference is that Steel's stripes are on the edges of his shoulderboards, while the sergeants' are in the middle.
</li><li> The sergeant who appears in "Enter the Madkat" and "Katastrophe" doesn't just wear two slightly different uniforms in each episode, but both are different from the other sergeants'.
</li><li> Evidence room clerk Smitty in "Katastrophe" has a sergeant's three rank chevrons on his sleeves. No other sergeant has these. Confusingly, they're on his dress shirt, <em>not</em> the jacket worn over them (presumably, anyway; Smitty isn't seen with his jacket on).
</li><li> Felina is a lieutenant, but lacks any insignia to distinguish her from Enforcers of other ranks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity">Sheep in the Big City</a></em> had Private Public serve as second-in-command to General Specific, when in real life private is the lowest military rank possible aside from a recruit rank.
</li></ul></div>
