</p><p>The murderer, almost always a man, kills his wife and children (and in rare cases, his in-laws or parents) as a means to "protect" the family from discovering the killer's own failures at life (e.g., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnconfessedUnemployment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnconfessedUnemployment">Unconfessed Unemployment</a>, financial ruin, or the disintegration of the family unit for some other reason).

If he can't bring himself to kill himself, he will either flee town to escape his crimes or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">blame it on an outside party</a>.

Having lost his job and become deeply in debt, List's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> was that poverty was an affront to God, so it would be better for his family to go straight to heaven than on welfare.

</p><p>Current social mores play a big part in how sympathetic the murderer remains to the audience — while few would suggest that debt is a good reason to kill your family, fantasy situations involving the threat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> will leave many people arguing that the act was justified, or at least sympathetic. However, the variant where the killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">doesn't follow through and end his own life</a> is almost always portrayed as unforgivable.

<ul><li> In one episode, Joe Kenda (the titular character), is very upset to realize that a man murdered his wife, daughter, and grandson before turning the gun on himself (he was upset about his daughter's impending divorce and somehow convinced that it reflected badly on him as a father). Ironically, Kenda was already suspecting this trope; he just assumed that the woman's ex was the one responsible.
</li><li> In another episode, he's equally horrified to realize that a cancer-stricken and mentally ill woman shot her husband and children before shooting herself.

The murders were popularized by the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmityvilleHorror1979" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmityvilleHorror1979">The Amityville Horror (1979)</a></em> which depicts the horrific and <em>supposedly true</em> story of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lutz">the Lutz Family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who moved into the DeFeo home a year after the killings and experienced traumatic supernatural activity that, to this day, they feel is not worth mentioning.

Before being arrested, he seduced and swindled (but didn't kill) another woman in Australia, and was courting yet another woman when the two past crimes were discovered. The number and callousness of the killings led to speculation at the time that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a>, although the major differences mean that few people nowadays take that seriously.
</li><li> In 1905, Swiss farmer Jean Lanfray murdered his pregnant wife and their two daughters in a drunken rage after quarreling with his wife. The police soon discovered that Lanfray had drunk seven glasses of wine, six glasses of cognac, a coffee laced with brandy, two creme de menthes, and two glasses of absinthe after eating lunch and before killing his family. Despite the fact that Lanfray had consumed a very large amount of alcohol, moral panic cited his consumption of absinthe as the sole motivator for the crimes. Not only was Lanfray found guilty of the murders, but the sensationalism of the case fueled the then-fledgling temperance movement, resulting in eventually getting absinthe banned, first in Switzerland in 1908, then soon after in most of Europe and the United States. As of 2011, these bans have largely been repealed.

He went into hiding, adopted an alias, re-married, and would have gotten away with his crime if not for <em>America's Most Wanted</em> doing a special on him. In a real-life example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelTwistEnding">Cruel Twist Ending</a>, when the abandoned List home burned down the year after the murders, investigators found an antique stained glass ceiling that was worth more than enough money to solve the family's financial problems, at least in the short term, making the deaths <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">especially pointless</a>.
</li><li> Another real-life version was the tragedy surrounding professional wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a>, who murdered his wife and son then hanged himself using his weights machine. Exactly why it happened is not known, but a history of steroid use and some pretty significant brain injuries were likely involved since the autopsy showed that "Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient." Another reason would be the death of his best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>, which was reportedly something he was never fully able to move on from.

</li><li> The Korean general Ge Baek did this because he was going out into battle and knew he would lose. He killed his whole family before he left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">to prevent the enemy from capturing them</a>.

</li><li> A Japanese teacher commented (after 30 years of living there) that suicide numbers in Japan would be a lot higher were family members dying via familicide counted.

</li><li> Jean-Claude Romand: a French drop-out from medical school, managed to make everyone in his family believe that he was a doctor working for the World Health Organization. The biggest irony is that he was knowledgeable enough in medicine so that genuine doctors would not realize that he was an impostor when they spoke to him, making you wonder why he just did not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">pass his exams and become what he claimed he was</a>.

His story was profiled on the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em>. The world may never know for sure if he did it because he disappeared in 1976 long before the bodies were discovered and there hasn't been a sighting of him since 1994. If he is still alive, he'd be well into his seventies by now.
</li><li> The Celts used to do this if they lost a battle.

He shot himself in the head but survived three days in a coma, during which Nepal's constitution mandated that he be declared King, regardless of his invocation of this trope.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dateline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dateline">Dateline</a></em> once had an episode about a family with a failed example of this (the father didn't have a chance to kill himself). Most of the children were found dead in the house after a police stand-off. The father of the children, Marcus Wesson, ran the family as a small cult and believed he was the Second Coming of Jesus. The survivors were interviewed and said that their father actually told them to kill all small children and then themselves if the police ever found them. Wesson lived and was sentenced to death row.
</li><li> In early 2007, Thai businessman Boonchai Surawuthipong was in debt and worried that the mafia would abduct his children. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/07/headlines/headlines_30026198.php">So he shot his wife, his three children, and himself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Another female instance: People's Temple member Sharon Amos killed her two younger children (ages 11 and 10), then convinced 21-year-old daughter Liane to assist her suicide before Liane's own death. Amos was convinced that she and her children would be murdered anyway as a result of the assassination of Congressman Leo Ryan and members of his party at a nearby airstrip by People's Temple members. That assassination also triggered the mass murder/suicide at Jonestown. Since leader Jim Jones was considered a parental figure by his followers, he may well also qualify for this trope, especially since his own wife and several of his own children also died there.
</li><li> There was a rash of these in pre-Revolutionary America; in fact, it's from descriptions of the events that we get the term "family annihilator" to describe such scenarios.
</li><li> Manling Williams suffocated her two young sons in their sleep and chopped her husband up with a Japanese sword because she had grown bored with her domesticated family life, but couldn't face the shame of divorce. She confessed to the crime when the police found evidence that was too overwhelming to get out of and sentenced to death on January 18th, 2012. She remains on death row to this day.
</li><li> During China's Three Kingdoms Era, following Liu Shan's surrender of Shu to Wei, his son, Liu Chan, unwilling to live with the disgrace, is said to have killed his wife and children before killing himself.

When Tom filed for custody of their two sons because of the incestuous relationship (and among other things, Klenner was a fraud practicing medicine though he'd never even been to college, as well as a virulent racist), Fritz and Susie began killing people who could support Tom either financially or personally—his mother and sister as well as <em>her</em> parents and grandmother. When the cops came to confront the pair, they grabbed the boys and took off in their SUV. After a 15-minute chase, Susie fatally shot her sons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bsr6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bsr6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bsr6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">autopsies performed on the boys showed they were already dead before their mother and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">stepfather</a> blew the car up</span>, then detonated a bomb located under her seat, destroying the car and killing them both.

The only child spared was his eldest son, whom he'd sent on an errand shortly before the crime. This crime and its suspected motivations (Lawson was rumored to have been sexually abusing one of his daughters, resulting in her pregnancy) have entered into local lore, inspiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad">Murder Ballad</a>.

Police grew suspicious of his story that the murders were committed by drug-crazed home invaders when they noticed how minor his injuries were compared to the bludgeoning his wife and daughters received. It's believed his motive was simply he no longer wanted the responsibility of marriage and fatherhood. MacDonald maintains his innocence to this day. He claims there were four assailants but even though they were supposed to be as high as a kite they did the following:

The death certificates for Charlotte, Beatrix, and Alice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom">Quinn</a> do not mention him as their father.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in 2018, in New South Wales, John Edwards shot his two teenage children in their home after almost a decade of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>, then shot himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPeopleAbuseAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPeopleAbuseAnimals">and his dog</a> to escape life imprisonment. His ex-wife killed herself in grief several months after the murders, completing this trope by proxy.
</li><li> February 2020 saw the murders of Hannah Clarke and her three children though car bombing by her abusive ex-husband Rowan Baxter, in a murder-suicide that angered the entire nation and lead to laws pushing for further actions against domestic violence. The crime was so shocking, that the marriage was posthumously terminated, the children were buried under their mother's maiden name, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeMinistersOfAustralia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeMinistersOfAustralia">Prime Minster</a></em> attended their funeral.
</li></ul></li><li> On August 14, 2018, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/people.com/crime/shanann-watts-husband-chris-did-not-believe-cheating/amp/">Christopher Watts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> reported his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperiledInPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperiledInPregnancy">pregnant wife</a> Shannan and their two daughters missing. By the next day, he was under arrest, having confessed to murdering all three, though he later changed his story to claim that <em><strong>she</strong></em> killed the girls and that he then killed her in a rage over her actions before admitting that his original statement was the truth.
</li><li> A lesbian couple named Jennifer and Sarah Hart adopted six children, and continuously abused them all for years until child protection services became aware of what's going on. Before they could cancel the adoptions, the two drove off a cliff with the six children tied up and drugged in the backseat on March 26, 2018, leaving no survivors.
</li><li> In September of 1995, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Borel">Eric Borel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shot and bludgeoned his mother, step-father, and brother, before going on a killing spree, murdering 12 and wounding 4 others before shooting himself.
</li><li> In a similar vein to the above, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_O._Barton">Mark O. Barton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> would beat his wife and two children to death on July 27, 1999 after losing large sums of money, then murder 9 more innocents and wound 13 in two separate locations before killing himself after a police manhunt caught up to him.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Willett">Alan Willett<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attempted to kill his family, succeeding at killing his eldest son and developmentally disabled brother. After his suicide failed, he was arrested, condemned, and executed.
</li><li> Considering her entire family to be a burden (except her second daughter, who was her favorite child and <em>accomplice</em>), Diane Staudte murdered her husband and autistic son with antifreeze and was working on killing her oldest and youngest daughters when she was caught. The older daughter survived what <em>should</em> have been lethal doses of antifreeze, but was left with enough brain damage that she had to be put in a care home. The youngest daughter hadn't ingested enough antifreeze to be seriously ill, and was put in foster care. The middle daughter was sentenced to a minimum of 42 years and Diane herself received life without parole.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/09/24/ive-just-slaughtered-my-entire-family-markham-man-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-his-mother-father-sister-and-grandmother-over-several-hours-last-summer.html">Menhaz Zaman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> killed his family after falsely getting them to believe he was graduating from university when he actually failed out of some classes. He did end up admitting to his crime, however.
