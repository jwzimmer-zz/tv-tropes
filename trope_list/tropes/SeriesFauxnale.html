</p><p>Perhaps the creators were uncertain of the future, so they produce something that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">quickly tie up the big loose ends</a> in the event they aren't able to continue, but then they were told they could.

Whatever the reason, a series finale of some kind was created, but the series went on after that, making that previous series finale a "fake" one.

<ul><li> Done deliberately in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>Return to Shiganshina</em></span> arc, which gathers all the heroes and villains in the place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereItAllBegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereItAllBegan">Where It All Began</a>. A massive battle ensues, tons of characters die and it all ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eren and co. reaching the long-rumored basement and learning the truth about the Titans and supposedly solving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery">Ontological Mystery</a> that drove the series.</span> The anime takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by also making it a giant throwback to Season 1 with an OP that directly referenced Season 1s intros, brought back tons of songs during the episodes not heard since then, and even used the Season 1 animation style of thicker black lines and shading during the episode when the basement was finally opened. But alas, the manga would pick up where the story left off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a></span>, and the anime would follow suit with <em>The Final Season</em>.
</li><li> A strange example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> anime, which reaches the end of the manga with Train defeating Creed and foiling his plans. Then suddenly, with only a single minor scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> (and an entire story arc revolving around Eve's creator and her origins being strangely absent), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">several members of the Numbers are revealed to be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for a whole other organization, and the series ends in a four-episode anime-only story arc instead that changes Eve's origins entirely. It can't even be explained away as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a>, since the anime started a whole year after the manga ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em>:
<ul><li> At first, fans assumed that the Mythos Cyborg arc might have also been intended as a finale. The arc ends very abruptly, with an explosion destroying everything and the narrator noting that there were no traces of any of the cyborgs left behind (leaving viewers to assume they'd died). However, the reality is that Ishinomori had trouble with the editorial department in Weekly Shonen King, who decided to drop the series as they felt the Mythos arc was too confusing and complicated for children to understand. Thus when given the final chapter, he ended things off in a rushed and ambiguous manner.
</li><li> The <em>actual</em> original ending was the Underground Empire arc in 1967; however, fans did <em>not</em> take very well to the bittersweet (yet now considered iconic) finale in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cyborgs 002 and 009 fall to Earth, dying upon re-entry and becoming a "shooting star" seen by two children. The brother wishes for a toy gun, but the sister wishes for peace</span>. Fan outcry convinced Shotaro Ishinomori to resume the series soon enough, and he threw in a retcon for that ending. Although, as far as the Sega CD game in the '90s goes, this moment is where the series ends, and although the 2001 anime also loosely adapted the prologue of "Conclusion: God's War" as a post-series OVA, this moment was also intended to end the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/intended-end/">multiple instances<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the series might have ended, but didn't. Here are some of the better known cases:
<ul><li> The manga initially was not very popular. While Akira Toriyama did take steps to address common criticisms of it as soon as the first arc concluded, the third arc in which The Red Ribbon Army is the central antagonist, was written in such a way that the story could have a satisfiying ending if it was indeed canceled. The arc was a hit, however, and so Toriyama decided to continue. The comic becomes turbulent from here on, as Toriyama keeps writing what he thinks will be a good way to end things only to decide to continue instead.
</li><li> The 23rd Budokai, where Goku defeated Piccolo. For the anime, this was the conclusion of the original series with the story continuing as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. While time skips are routine in <em>Dragon Ball</em>, there usually being one between each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>, this remains the longest canonical skip, which is a large part of why the anime adaptation treated this as the end of <em>Dragon Ball</em> and what came after as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. In the manga, Master Roshi broke the fourth wall to confirm that the story will in fact be continuing.
</li><li> The end of the Cell Saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> very much <em>does</em> feel like a finale, with Goku dying in one last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a> to his son Gohan, who finally unlocks the great potential that's been hinted at ever since his introduction years earlier and defeats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who Goku couldn't. It actually <em>was</em> the finale of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Re-Cut</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> before it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">Un-Cancelled</a>.
</li><li> Ironically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> was considered this for a long while for the <em>Dragon Ball</em> series. Then, 20 years later, after the warm reception to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn">Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!</a></em> special short, the folks over at Toei decided to try their luck again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, both retconning <em>GT</em> and fulfilling this trope at once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> ended in 2010 but was surprisingly renewed for another season in 2014. It helped that the first season only adapted the first 3 books of the series, and that it ended with a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">lingering plot threads</a> to be potentially explored in future episodes.
</li><li> The Southern Cross story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> (the first ten chapters of the manga and the first 22 episodes of the anime) was written so that it could stand on its own in case the manga wasn't picked up. Shin's status as Kenshiro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMotivationalNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMotivationalNemesis">Token Motivational Nemesis</a> (being the guy who engraved Ken's seven scars and stole his girlfriend) is cemented afterward when the manga continued beyond his death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> gives us an epic battle between Nakago and the Suzaku Seishi (and Seiryuu and Suzaku themselves!) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTokyoFireball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTokyoFireball">in Tokyo</a> before fast-forwarding to three and a half months later to symbolically wrap things up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryBlossoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryBlossoms">Cherry Blossoms</a>. This was supposed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> for both the anime and the manga, but... y'know.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> has a similar example to that of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em>'s, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Pasder being defeated for good in episode 30. Then the Primevals happened. This one's entirely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a>. It had only filled out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">half the episodes</a> of any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BraveSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BraveSeries">Brave Series</a></em> and made it known by revealing King J-der's lovingly animated design and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>.
</li><li> Happened multiple times with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episode 201 abruptly ended with Kagura breaking the fourth wall and saying "Happy Merry Last Episode!" followed by the usual credits sequence being replaced with a montage of moments from throughout the show's history. Despite the strong implication that this was meant to be the end, the show returned for another season the following year.
</li><li> Following another 64 episodes, the anime seemingly ended for good with the 2013 release of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a> that acted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. However, the success of the movie led to the show being revived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">again</a></em> in 2015. The season premier even poked fun at the whole affair by having Gintoki give a press conference where he apologized for the show having returned again despite the seeming finality of the film.
</li><li> Meanwhile, the manga seemingly reached its conclusion with <em>Silver Soul</em>, an epic arc that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">brought back nearly every character who'd ever appeared in the series</a> for a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld">Save the World</a> plot. Then, at the last moment, it was revealed that the series would continue online with an epilogue arc that ran for another 36 chapters before <em>finally</em> ending once and for all.
</li><li> Then, in 2018, the anime began its adaptation of <em>Silver Soul</em>, with this season promised as the last one for real this time. Despite this, the season once again finished with the characters breaking the fourth wall to apologize for the lack of a proper ending, followed by an announcement that <em>another</em> movie would be released in 2021 to finish the story.

SAO was originally a web novel written from 2001-2008 with <em>Alicization</em> being the final major story arc completed before the series became an officially published light novel starting 2009. It has many hallmarks of being a series finale, with the Underworld project being the culmination of the Seed technology developed by Akihiko Kayaba, Kirito's worst and oldest enemy, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the leader of Laughing Coffin a.k.a. the "Prince of Hell"</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">finally returning</a> for one last showdown after missing for much of the series, another one of Kirito's worst enemies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nobuyuki Sugou</span> also playing a major role as a background antagonist, and almost all of the friends and allies he and Asuna have made throughout the franchise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> such as the original Aincrad crew, Sinon, General Eugene, Sakuya &amp; Alicia, the Sleeping Knights, and even the digital ghost of Kayaba</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">all returning</a> in his darkest hour. And for 10 years, <em>Alicization</em> was indeed the ending of the franchise. However in 2018, Reki Kawahara then published the beginning of the <em>Unital Ring</em> arc, which continues the story beyond <em>Alicization's</em> end.

Then the American studio that did the dubbing commissioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">twenty more episodes</a>, which had Planet Doom suddenly become a threat again, featured very bad writing, and ended on an episode that didn't really resolve anything.

The last issue of the second arc, "Funeral for a Friend," ends with Superman's body being returned to its final resting place, Lois accepting that her fiancee is gone now, Luthor getting past being unable to be the one to kill Superman himself, and Jonathan Kent apparently succumbing to a grief-induced heart attack as the last page shows him flatlining. The title of the story was even called "The End," and both the title and issue credits came at the end of the comic, and the issue was filled with tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a> flashing back to key events from Superman comics since the Post-Crisis reboot began. After that all the main Superman books went on hiatus for a couple months, with only a few specials and one-shots getting published during that period, before the books finally came back and began the "Reign of the Supermen" arc. In reality, DC was never intending to end Superman for good, and only put the books on hold to help build up the hype for Superman's eventual return.
</li><li> The Final Night miniseries, which ends with Hal Jordan as Parallax sacrificing himself to relight the sun, was meant to be the final fate of the beloved Green Lantern after the "Emerald Twilight" and "Zero Hour" events turned him evil. The fans demanded Hal back, so he came back first as the new Spectre and then as Green Lantern in a major retcon.
</li><li> A <em>company-wide</em> version of this happened just before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>, with all the characters with running series "signing off" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> at the end.

Issue 31 of the ongoing series is purposely written so that it can be used as the final issue for the entire IDW continuity. As such, exactly what's happened between the previous issues and issue 31 is unclear. It takes place hundreds of years in the future, Ironhide and Alpha Trion are some of the few remaining members of the original Autobots, the Transformers live on Gorlam Prime instead of Cyberton, and Megatron and Optimus Prime have disappeared. This has now been Jossed. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron">The Transformers: Dark Cybertron</a></em> saw Gorlam Prime destroyed and left Ironhide concerned and suffered with depression that the happy ending he saw will not come to pass.

It has all the signs of "finality" in it, as the mysteries set up in the very first issue of season 1 (Brainstorm's briefcase, how the Sparkeater got into the ship, who sent the foreboding message from the future) are answered in a time travel plot that also details the start of the war (notably Megatron's birth), and we even learn how the ship the series takes place on, the Lost Light, was created. It also closes out the trilogy of Flashback arcs that were sporadically told throughout Roberts's and Costa's runs.

Then came a sequel, not in book form, but in theater: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">Spin-Offspring</a> that deals with the aftermath of the "happy ending" of the last book, which turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">not that happy</a>. And of course, there is no shortage of post-series supplementary materials churned out regularly by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">author</a>, many of which were released before <em>Cursed Child</em> was even a thing.
</li><li> When, after five books, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a> grew tired of writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> novels despite their popularity, he issued <em>The Emerald City of Oz</em> (1910) as a finale to the series, going so far as to state in the final chapter that with Oz now magically cut off from the rest of the world, there would be no further installments, as Dorothy could no longer communicate with him. Three years later, the financially struggling Baum, finding that his non-Oz books weren't selling, resumed the series with <em>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</em>, offering the in-universe explanation that the "wireless telegraph" enabled further communication between him and Dorothy. Thereafter Baum published seven more Oz volumes before his death, and the official series, under various writers, continued until 1963.
</li><li> An in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Misery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Misery">Misery</a></em>, where Annie forces Paul to write a sequel to <em>Misery's Child</em>, even though he had intended it to be the last of the series, and had gleefully killed off the main character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mog">Mog</a></em>: "Goodbye, Mog" was initially meant to be the last book in the series and Mog appeared to be dead, but then "Mog's Christmas Calamity" got written and she was alive and well again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> series seemingly ended with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CityOfGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CityOfGlass">City of Glass</a></em>...which marked the end of the "first" trilogy and was followed by the first book in the "second" trilogy.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RamonaQuimby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RamonaQuimby">Ramona Quimby</a></em>: <em>Ramona Forever</em> definitely reads as if it were meant to be the last book of the series, ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">the birth of a new Quimby sister</a> and with Ramona reflecting on all the past misadventures of her young life, with subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">shout outs</a> to events from the previous books. But fifteen years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeverlyCleary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeverlyCleary">Beverly Cleary</a> followed it up with the true series finale, <em>Ramona's World.</em>
</li><li> Most famously, "The Final Problem" for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em>, in which Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes off in a struggle with Professor Moriarty. Because of public outcry, he eventually retconned the death and resumed the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>: <em>The Last Hope</em> was intended to be the finale of the series as a whole, with there being a large climatic battle sequence, cameos and appearances from many characters, and a new era of sorts for the Clans. While new books did get released, they were mostly prequels. However, the releases of <em>Dovewing's Silence</em>, <em>Bramblestar's Storm</em>, and two sequel arcs, one of which is currently still ongoing, quickly proved that the series wasn't going to end soon.

Only the addition of a couple of scenes, revealing a new threat, were necessary for the show to keep on going. This led to one of the hallmarks of the series: invariably, the problem that started the arc of the season (and the villains behind it) always turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> material as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">the real plan was helped by the heroes efforts</a>, or the bad guys adjust their strategy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">plan B is even worse than plan A</a>. Whatever the season was advertised as being about is long-forgotten old news by episode 15.

Then, the show was un-cancelled...

Thus, said finale is designed very much like an ending (even being titled "The End"), and wraps up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo">Coulson and May leaving the team</a> and going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Tahiti</a> in order to spend Coulson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">last days</a> in peace.

<ul><li> "The Stivics Go West", which wrapped up season 8 with Mike, Gloria, and Joey bidding a tearful goodbye to Archie and Edith and moving to California. Norman Lear had indeed intended for this to be the show's finale, but CBS executives (along with Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton) convinced him to let the show continue for another season without his participation.
</li><li> It can be argued that the show's <em>actual</em> finale, "Too Good Edith", was this as well, since <em>All in the Family</em> was then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retooled</a> into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace">Archie Bunker's Place</a></em>, which lasted for four more seasons.

<ul><li> Almost of the shows season finales were like this, most noticeably the season 3 finale, Development Arrested, was the actual finale for many years until the show was brought back for a Netflix revival in 2013

So <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> (the show's creator and writer) squeezed the first half of the fifth season's plot into the three penultimate episodes at the end of season four in order to resolve most of the major story arcs, resulting in season four's second half containing nothing <em>but</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episodes</a>. Then the show got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled">Uncanceled</a>, season five happened on schedule, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">JMS</a> had to scramble to fill the gap in season five's plot by stretching out what was planned as a minor continuing storyline into a half-season-long arc. Most fans agree that the first half of season five is the weakest stretch of the entire show. It's worth noting that they filmed the last episode of the fourth season as the series-ending finale, but rather than run it there it was pushed to the actual end of the series.
</li><li> The season 4 mid-season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>, "Sometimes a Great Notion", was written with the intent of serving as a finale in the event that the 2007 writer's strike prevented the remaining episodes from being made. It would have been quite the cliffhanger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>: the third season ends with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> destruction of the protagonists' almost-magical spaceship, the Liberator.

</li><li> The Season 10 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> ended this way, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Angela and Hodgins deciding not to move to Paris after all but to stay in DC, Booth recovering from his lapse into his old gambling addiction and reconciling with Brennan, and the two of them deciding to leave DC for a quieter life in Kansas, in order to protect both Christine and their as-yet-unborn second child</span>. The show was still on the bubble at the time, so the producers wanted to end on a quieter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a> note in case this was the last season, but the show was renewed shortly before the finale aired.
</li><li> Not explicitly, but the Season 4 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> was written to invoke a feeling of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>, since Vince Gilligan was not sure about a 5th season due to struggles between AMC and Sony.
<ul><li> Season 5's second cour was dubbed "The Final Season" and its definitive ending is partly what made the series so famous. However, the franchise continues with the spin-off prequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, and the announcement of a sequel film focusing on Jesse Pinkman after the events of Season 5.

The show changed networks from the WB to UPN starting with the sixth season, and UPN signed a contract guaranteeing the show two seasons on the air. Since Season Six was the only season filmed <em>without</em> worries about whether the show would be renewed, the Season Six finale is the only one in the series to end on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>.

In the end, they sell it to their longtime friend Lou. However, the show has gotten extreme popularity, and because of that, it continued on after its third season without the Rosses from there, and eventually became the first live-action Disney Channel show to exceed four seasons.

Lead character Stephanie Wells returns to her publisher job (having been shuffled off to a retreat in the previous episode) and reasserts her dominance at <em>Communique</em>, humiliating her managing editor in the process, before she and her husband decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">leave New York and take their chances back in Seattle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">having had enough of the politics and backstabbing and wanting to save their marriage</a>. Despite this feeling of finality, the episode did set up additional storyarcs, including newspaper columnist Alex deciding to fake her pregnancy so she can marry Peter Fairchild, and a media tycoon comes to New York and enlists stock broker Gil to help him take over Rush Media.

The third season finale ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastEpisodeThemeReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastEpisodeThemeReprise">Last Episode Theme Reprise</a>, a relatively happy ending for the main characters, and a sense that "if it ends here... that's not too bad."
</li><li> The fourth season had one of these as well, since they didn't expect the last second renewal for a fifth season. The finale ends with Jeff and Pierce finally graduating from Greendale and Jeff giving a touching speech about how his friends have changed him and made him a better person throughout the course of the series. He then states that even though he's leaving, he'll still pop in from time to time to hang out with his old friends. It's ambiguous enough to both serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> moment (but not as blatant as the season 3 finale) and open the door for future episodes.
</li><li> The fifth season also has one of these, since nobody involved could have predicted that the series would be picked up by Yahoo Screen. This finale involved the discovery of the original founder of Greendale and his massive wealth, allowing the study group to prevent Greendale from being turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Subway Sandwich University</a>, only for Chang to take all the money and spend it on replacing his teeth with diamonds without anyone (apart from a concerned Abed) noticing. The ending also had Abed commenting that, if they weren't coming back the following year, it would be because an asteroid has destroyed human civilization. ("And that's canon.")

</li><li> The Season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> was filmed as an adequate ending to the series, with George finally accepting her life as a Reaper and her family reconciling with her death, but the series ultimately got one more season... and then a direct to dvd movie five years after <em>that</em>. Though a lot of fans choose to ignore that last one.

<div class="indent"><em>"There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song.

It came out in 2001, when the show had been off-air for 12 years, save a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie">TV movie</a> in 1996, although the huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> was still running. It has a universe where the Time Lords have either been mostly killed off or are withdrawing, possibly tying into the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a></em> at the time.

However it, oddly enough, features the 7th Doctor instead of the 8th, who was the current Doctor, and in many ways feels unlike <em>Doctor Who</em>, with aspects like changing Time Lords from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warpers</a>.

</li><li> In a downplayed example that concerned an era rather than the entire show, the two-part Series 10 finale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E11WorldEnoughAndTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E11WorldEnoughAndTime">"World Enough and Time"</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E12TheDoctorFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E12TheDoctorFalls">"The Doctor Falls"</a> was supposed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> for the Twelfth Doctor.

The end result? Worldwide apocalypse! Shockingly, the show was not canceled, but the second (and now final) season moved in a direction that indicates that episode is the likely conclusion. This is a Joss Whedon show, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">a happy ending was probably never likely anyway</a>.

</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> weren't sure the show was going to be picked up for a full first season. The 13th episode (which was as many as they had confirmed at first) was specifically written to be decent enough series finale if they got cancelled. (Glee club won their competition and the major plots of the first 13 were adequately wrapped up) However, the show ended up being a hit and got picked up for at least three seasons before the first season was finished.

However, the show had already been renewed for a fourth season by the time the episode aired.
</li><li> Strangely, the Volume 4 finale to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> feels like one of these. Sylar is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly defeated once and for all</span>, and all the Heroes come together to contemplate the future and start "a new beginning". There's just two little hitches in the plan...

When more episodes were ordered, Victoria was Retconned into being just another of Ted's girlfriends. Similarly the last episode of season 3 was created with the idea that Stella would be the mother if the show didn't get renewed.
</li><li> The season four episode "The Leap" was also written as a possible send off for the characters which could easily function as a series finale.

Then there was "Farewell, Kamen Rider Den-O: The Final Countdown." That sounds like a done deal, right? Nope, then came The Onigashima Warship, and the Super Den-O Trilogy. The name "trilogy" makes the third of those films final-sounding... but then came "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO">OOO</a>, Den-O, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow">All Riders</a>: Let's Go, Kamen Rider!"

"The Maltese Falcon Job" (season 2) ends with Nate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shot and about to be arrested while the team escapes</span>.

Mary comes to terms with her blindness and the entire citizenship of the now financially crippled town of Walnut Grove gather at the church one last time to say goodbye. The show was then picked up for a fifth season.
</li><li> Unlike previous seasons, the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016">Lucifer</a></em> does not end with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a> and features no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>. Chloe finally accepts Lucifer for what he is and confesses her feelings, but has to part ways with him as he reluctantly retakes the mantle of the King of Hell to prevent more demons from invading Earth. Since the series started in the first place because Lucifer abandoned his post in Hell to essentially have fun, by returning back, it neatly closes the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> and shows Lucifer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> as he chooses to do what is needed instead of what he wants. Other plotlines resolved include Amenadiel's difficulty to accept the complexities of the human world, Dan's struggle to move on from Charlotte's death, Ella's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a>, and Maze's decision to carve a separate life of her own.

</li><li> The third-season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em> would have been the big finish if they hadn't been renewed, given that it ended with Jane finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Red John</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice">Miami Vice</a></em> features a very interesting example of this. The show, which premiered in 1985, faced dismal ratings when it aired and was in danger of being canceled. To that end, the producers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retooled</a> the series with a two-part episode that also served as a finale if the show was canned.

</li><li> While the seventh-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>, "Goodbye, Michael", is not technically an instance of this trope (as the show was always intended to continue past the departure of Steve Carrell's Michael Scott), it certainly <em>feels</em> like it could have brought a serviceable end to the series. Interestingly, for such a major change in the show's history, "Goodbye, Michael" wasn't even the <em>season</em> finale, there was still three more episodes left.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Going Home", where the entire plot of the series is wrapped up completely in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> up until a very literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> shows up at the last minute. A strange case of this trope since it was only the <em>midseason</em> finale, with another eleven episodes already in production when it aired, so the makers of the show obviously already knew it wasn't going to be the end when making it.
</li><li> "The Final Battle" in Season 6 is a more straight example, as it once again wraps up the series' plot and gave sendoffs to most of the main cast, but the creators did <em>not</em> know for sure if there would be another season afterward. As it turns out, there was, and it would be that following season's finale that was the ending of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill">One Tree Hill</a></em> had many of these:
<ul><li> First, with the gang graduating high school and then Lucas and Peyton driving away with their baby.
</li><li> Then at the end of season 7, the cast is shown playing on a snowy hill, and the parting shot was to have been all of them walking up the hill. When a renewal was assured, a cliffhanger scene was tacked on after that.
</li><li> The final scene in Season 8 recreates the first scene of the series, with Jamie replacing Lucas as he dribbles a basketball across the bridge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>: The December 1996 trilogy of <em>Heroes and Villains</em>, <em>Modern Men</em>, and <em>Time On Our Hands</em> were originally intended to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> for the show (the final episode pulling 24.1 million viewers), but another trilogy broadcast between 2001 and 2003 soon came.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/parks-and-recreation-co-creator-mike-schur-on-writing-the-perfect-finale-again-and-again-and-again">according to co-creator Mike Schur<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, has done this several times, due to the show's shaky ratings.
<ul><li> The showrunners were worried that, since <em>Parks</em> was a midseason replacement in season 3, that it would be cancelled soon after. So they wrote the season 3 finale, "Lil Sebastian", as a possible series finale.
</li><li> The season 4 finale, "Win, Lose or Draw" was also written as a respectable finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Leslie winning the city council election</span>.
</li><li> The season 5 episode "Leslie and Ben" was also written as a series finale because it was the last episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Front13Back9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Front13Back9">front 13</a> produced.
</li><li> A unique case with the Season 6 episode "Moving Up" with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leslie accepting a new job with the National Parks Department, the Unity Concert, and a 3-year time skip</span>. The show had already been renewed but the storylines of Season 6 were well in place pre-renewal. So they just went with it and Season 7 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetAjay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlanetAjay">Planet Ajay</a></em>'s finale episode, "Highlights Show", is set up to be like this, and likely would have been a straight example if the show went on any longer after its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunner">only 13-episode season</a>. The episode is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> where Chips the robot is trying to remind Ajay, who is packing up to go on a 2,517-year-long trip around the universe, of all that his friends did for him on Planet Ajay, but he fails to persuade him not to take the trip. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ajay decides against going on the trip at the last second, however, and he instead decides to throw a party for everyone on Planet Ajay... but he makes this decision right around the end of his 30-minute stay on Planet Ajay (Ajay travels to the planet via a magic ring whose magic wears out after 30 minutes), and he has to travel back to Earth.</span>

<ul><li> Due to a lack of understanding and faith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> for long-term survival by the various networks, when it was finally given its chance by Fox it was only meant to last for one season of 40 episodes total, only to be replaced by a more suitable long-term show once found. The show's intended series finale would have been the two-part episode "Doomsday" in which Rita Repulsa would have been permanently defeated in a similar manner as her counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</a></em>. Due to the show's unforeseen popularity however, the ending of "Doomsday" was changed at the last minute to leave open the possibility of future episodes. In addition, new suits and footage were quickly and specially commissioned from Toei by Saban to expand the first season to 60 episodes total, as Saban had only minimal usable footage of <em>Zyuranger</em> left after the first 40 episodes. At the same time Saban also secured the rights to use footage from subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> shows for future <em>Power Rangers</em> seasons.
</li><li> The finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em>, "Countdown to Destruction," was also made to end the series, with almost all the villains of the past and present launching a full-scale conquest of the universe, only for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zordon's death being required for his power to spread through the universe, reducing the overwhelming majority of the villains to dust and purifying a small handful of fan-favorites into non-evil humans</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Wild Force</a></em> was also meant to serve as the last season for the series, as the plan was for Disney (who'd bought out the series) to end it and put it into syndication. The seasonal content reflected this; in addition to featuring a 10th anniversary special that had every Red Ranger ever return, the two-parter finale was tellingly named "The End of the Power Rangers." And then someone convinced Disney to move filming to New Zealand and cut costs by a third.
</li><li> The season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> was supposed to be the series finale until Saban picked up the rights to the franchise again. It is the finale for Disney's ownership of the show, for better or worse. Its predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>, was also intended to be the last season, but Bandai, <em>who made the toys</em>, begged them into one more season - <em>RPM</em>.

Including the original 1988-99 run, there are <em>five</em> different episodes that could have served as the last ever. The more recent ones have more consciously tried to serve as potential last ever episodes; "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonXTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonXTheBeginning">The Beginning</a>" provides a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnd">Bookend</a> to the very first episode, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonXIISkipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonXIISkipper">Skipper</a>" is largely based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> The last episode of season five hosted by Buck Henry with musical guests Andrew Gold, Andrae Crouch, and Voices of Unity. It even ended with the remnants of the original "Not Ready for Primetime" cast running out of the studio as the "ON AIR" light flashed off for (what seemed like it would be) the final time.
</li><li> ...Then along came NBC's decision to continue the show, which, at first with Jean Doumanian and <em>her</em> cast (save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> and Joe Piscopo), was a bad idea. The last Doumanian-produced episode hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a> was also written as the last one...until Dick Ebersol stepped in as Doumanian's replacement.
</li><li> The last episode of season 11 (hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnjelicaHuston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnjelicaHuston">Anjelica Huston</a> and Billy Martin with musical guest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeClinton">George Clinton</a> and Parliament-Funkadelic) was written as the series finale as well, due to the low ratings and terrible reviews the show had gotten during the season. The final scene had everyone in the cast (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonLovitz">Jon Lovitz</a>) locked in a room that Lorne had set on fire. When the show was given a second chance at life, the final scene (and everything about season 11) was written off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> ("...a horrible, horrible dream").
</li><li> The last episode of season 20 (hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny">David Duchovny</a>), much like season 11, was also a series fauxnale that had a large majority of cast members killed off (as seen in the "Beastman" cold opening and the last sketch where the popular male cast members all throw themselves in a polar bear cage exhibit at the zoo).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> was intended at least two years beforehand to end with its eighth season. It almost didn't get an eighth season due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TVStrikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TVStrikes">TV Strikes</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hopped</a> from NBC to ABC (who owned the show) and ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> that both poked fun and emulated most series finales... before being picked up for its ninth season, with a mostly new cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV">seaQuest DSV</a></em>:

Episode ends with Lucas promising Dagwood they'd somehow find a way back to earth and make sure the seaQuest's fate wasn't forgotten... followed up with the caption "seaQuest DSV will return..."</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> is a weird case, as they weren't <em>told</em> to wrap it up because they were being canceled—they were intending to end the show after 10 seasons. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">told the writers that they wanted the show</a> around to help with the transitional period after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UPN">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB">merger</a>, so make an eleventh season.

</li><li> Season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em> ended with a very large bang, as Inspector Sledge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"Trust me, I know what I'm doing"</a> Hammer attempted to disarm a nuke... and failed. When the show got picked up for a second season, the cliffhanger was handwaved away by setting the new episodes "five years earlier", while continuing all ongoing story elements and character development unchanged. More precisely, they explained that the Season 1 finale took place five years <em>later</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> had <em>four</em> of these throughout its run: the finales of seasons 5, 6, 7 and 8:
<ul><li> The first two came when the writers were almost sure the network would end the series, and both ended on cliffhangers that were intended to lead up to a follow-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">theatrical movie</a>, which in turn would set up the spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>; both times, the series got renewed for a new season after all.
</li><li> For season 7, the planned theatrical movie was reworked into a two-episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> that would lead directly into <em>Atlantis</em>  but the series was renewed yet again, resulting in the finale's ending being rewritten so that <em>Atlantis</em> would be set in a different galaxy (to limit crossovers, as it was going to be contemporary with SG-1 rather than replacing it).
</li><li> Season 8 had a full-blown multi-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> that ended with an epic battle, the defeat of every major antagonist in the series, and the resolution of 8 years worth of character threads and plotlines. In fact, it wrapped things up so completely that the next season necessitated a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a> of the show. Ironically, when the series was actually cancelled after season 10 the writers were expecting an extra year, so they weren't able to make a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>  instead, the series ended with most major storylines unresolved, and the planned arc for season 11 was reworked into a direct-to-DVD movie follow-up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateTheArkOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateTheArkOfTruth">Stargate: The Ark of Truth</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> The second season finale saw the Winchester brothers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> finally defeat the enemy they'd been pursuing since the first episode</span>, as due to the series not quite yet being one of the iconic shows on the CW and renewal had yet to be confirmed, which is one reason that plotline was wrapped up so in case the show didn't return it at least would have an acceptable ending. Although there was a slight cliffhanger with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dean selling his soul and only having a year to live</span>, it wasn't as in your face about it as most other cliffhangers, having more of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">just business as usual</a>" feeling rather than a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment like the others.
</li><li> The fifth season is a pretty good example, even with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> at the very end. The story that had been building for the past 5 seasons had finally been resolved, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was defeated, series creator Kripke stopped writing the show, and it could have all been over.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>: Happened twice in the summer of 1980, as Fred Silverman was desperately trying to retool his daytime schedule to get rid of all game shows. The first time, a mock-up schedule scrubbed <em>Wheel</em> in favor of a 90-minute (and, some claim two hour) daytime talkfest hosted by David Letterman. Although Silverman was prepared to give Chuck Woolery time to say goodbye for the June 20, 1980 program, <em>Wheel</em> ultimately was spared, but almost wasn't as lucky later in the summer when Silverman ordered an hour-long version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em> and a new soap opera called <em>Texas.</em> In this latter case, a finale <em>was</em> ordered for August 1, 1980, with host Chuck Woolery inviting then-wife Jo Ann Pflug onstage to thank the viewers for "5-1/2 wonderful years," and kissing both her and hostess Susan Stafford on the lips after Stafford said her farewells. The show was completed sometime in early July 1980 ... but then NBC decided instead to trim Letterman's struggling show to 60 minutes, meaning <em>Wheel</em> again was spared. That meant a hastily edited program airing on Friday, August 1, editing out Woolery's farewell speech (although an extended full-length closing credits was still shown); on the following Monday, Woolery <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated">laughedly explains why they were back so soon</a>.

<ul><li> The first movie was meant to be the ending of the show, then Fox decided to hang onto their cash cow a while longer. The film's third act shows definite signs of being hastily rewritten to leave things open enough for the series to continue (Cigarette Smoking Man showing up in Antarctica and then leaving without actually doing anything being the most obvious).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheXFilesS07E22Requiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheXFilesS07E22Requiem">Requiem</a>", the last episode of season seven, was written to serve as a series finale if they didn't get picked up again.

Then the show was completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a>, and it was revealed that the wormhole led straight to Earth.

It should be mentioned that every season finale was a multi-part blowout in case they didn't get picked up again.

For years, this episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">never aired in the United States</a>, only becoming available years after the show's run through the complete series DVD set and digital download.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> ended its third season assuming that there wouldn't be a fourth season, wrapping things up nicely.
</li><li> Although there aren't many loose ends to tie up, most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> season finales involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">the show being canceled</a>, should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">life imitate art</a>. Given the show's high ratings leading to things like two-season orders, at this point, it's purely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>.
</li><li> The original run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> ended with an episode where Angelica was moving away, and Tommy told the others he would miss her. When the others asked for clarification, Tommy explained how it was Angelica who made them all friends, complete with a flashback origin story. It turned out Angelica didn't have to move, but it ended up in one of her purest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> moments, and because of that the series later got renewed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> had the episode "Aku's Fairy Tales", a largely comedic episode centered around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Aku</a> telling fables to a group of young children, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale">altered to feature him as the protagonist and Samurai Jack as the villain.</a> After failing to entertain them, Aku leaves frustrated. The kids tell their own story, wherein Samurai Jack reaches a portal to his own time period after striking down Aku once and for all. This episode, despite taking place in the imagination of children, was meant to provide some semblance of closure if the show were not renewed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: The season 23 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E9HolidaysOfFuturePassed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E9HolidaysOfFuturePassed">Holidays of Future Passed</a>" was slated to be the final episode, as FOX was having budget issues with the show. Once everyone agreed to take a pay cut in order to keep the show afloat for at least two more seasons, this was re-framed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>. The show is currently on track for 32 seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite the blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> the show has, the creator made it clear that the first movie will always be the series finale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon-wise</a>, no matter how long the show goes for or how little sense it may make due to material in any given post-movie episodes. Naturally, the series carried on due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and even spawned more movies (albeit with no direct links to the first one).
</li><li> "SpongeBob's Last Stand" was thought to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> (and its name also suggests this), with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">Near-Villain Victory</a> (Plankton has successfully driven away business from the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs was ready to hand over the Krabby Patty secret formula, until a bunch a jellyfish stopped that from happening by going on a rampage, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a> moment for Plankton).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>: After it was cancelled in 2013, the show's truncated sixth season was released on Netflix, culminating in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS6E13Sacrifice">"Sacrifice"</a>, an episode focusing on Yoda that brought the show to something of a conclusion. At the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncanceled">announced</a> that a seventh and final season was coming to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a>, eventually premiering in February 2020.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Season 1's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E25MirrorGem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E25MirrorGem">"Mirror Gem"</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E26OceanGem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E26OceanGem">"Ocean Gem"</a> was approached as though the network would decide not to renew the series for a second season. The episode revealed that the Crystal Gems are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">aliens rather than mystical beings</a>, that all the monsters they've fought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">are also Gems</a>, and has Steven successfully use his abilities on command for the first time. The episode's ending conversation between Garnet and Pearl was also originally meant to be more conclusive. The show ended up being renewed for more episodes early enough that it was replaced with a vaguer exchange that would help set up the remainder of a now extended season, with the two-parter now being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonTwist">midseason</a> finale.
</li><li> Season 5's finale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E28ChangeYourMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E28ChangeYourMind">"Change Your Mind"</a> concluded the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Crystal Gems defeat the Diamonds and convince them of the error of their ways, the Corrupted Gems are cured, Steven makes peace with his mothers legacy, Homeworld is heading towards a brighter future</span>, and most of the major plotlines are conclusively wrapped up). Creator Rebecca Sugar wanted this season to be the end of that main storyline, regardless of if they were renewed for more episodes... which they were. The network's season six order ended up becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">sequel series</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em>, which parts of the fanbase still treat as season six regardless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>: The three-part finale of the fourth season, meaningfully titled "The End", pitted the Titans against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Trigon</a> in a post-apocalyptic wasteland for the sake of the entire universe. Then the show was renewed for a fifth and final season, with two separate endings: a straightforward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> featuring every major character in the show, and a much more downbeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenouementEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenouementEpisode">Dénouement Episode</a> focusing on Beast Boy and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> Terra.
</li><li> The fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> ended with the spies leaving WOOHP and saying their goodbyes to Jerry. This was later followed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingSpiez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingSpiez">The Amazing Spiez</a></em>, in which they made occasional cameos, and a sixth season in 2013.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ContestOfChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ContestOfChampions">Contest of Champions</a>" arc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpider-Man">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> was written to serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> for the show, but at the last second, Disney XD picked up the cartoon for one more season, making it the longest-running <em>Spider-Man</em> adaptation to date.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>: "Defender of All Universes", the Season 6 finale, has a sense of coming full circle in its conclusion that makes it feel a lot like a series finale, even when it was made with the full knowledge that they had two more seasons. If not for the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Honerva was still out there</span>, the story could have wrapped up in that episode. There's even a unique credits sequence for it. Quite possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> referencing the original <em>Voltron</em>, which as mentioned above, also had a Series Fauxnale as its 52nd episode.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> movie was clearly intended to be a proper ending to the series with Bloom finally finding her birth parents after three seasons searching for them, and Sky asking her to marry him. But then we're given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> where the Ancestral Witches (whose spirits were freed when Bloom saved her home) possess the Trix. The creator of the series, Iginio Straffi, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.corriereadriatico.it/SPETTACOLI/rainbow_avventure_winx_iginio_straffi_villa_musone_marche_rai2/notizie/421983.shtml">said in an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he always planned the show to end after the third season. The show was eventually renewed for more seasons and given two more movies (the first of which resolved the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>), but Straffi wasn't heavily involved with them.
</li><li> The 1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> cartoon:
<ul><li> Episode 13, "The Final Decision", has a number of arcs cleanly tied up in case the series wasn't renewed: The Sentinels are defeated, Beast is released from prison, Senator Kelly stops his anti-mutant rhetoric, Magneto and Xavier form a truce, Rogue and Gambit share an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndirectKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndirectKiss">Indirect Kiss</a>, and Cyclops asks Jean to marry him. It ends with a clearly-tacked-on voice-over by Mr. Sinister (and it sounds nothing like the actor who eventually played Mr. Sinister! It was all <em>very</em> quick-and-dirty.) to set up the next season's arc.
</li><li> There was also "Beyond Good and Evil", written to be the finale. It was a massively massive four-parter where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">damn near everybody</a> takes part in an epic that crosses time and space, from ancient Egypt to the present to Bishop's future to Cable's future <em>and</em> Deathbird (who was standing in the background when Fabian Cortez met Apocalypse back in "Sanctuary;" you knew there was something to that!) shows up. In the end, Apocalypse appears to be defeated once and for all. And they get renewed. The <em>actual</em> finale was more quiet and emotional than either of the blockbuster epic finales: Professor X is dying, and we get some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> moments, character exploration, and <em>one</em> fight that ends when Magneto is told he can help save Xavier's life. As it ends with Xavier <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leaving for intensive care in the Shi'ar galaxy, with those he taught as the caretakers of his dream</span>, it is named "Graduation Day."
