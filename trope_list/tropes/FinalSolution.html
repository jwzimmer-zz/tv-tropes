</p><p>Before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">the 20th century</a>, this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">wasn't really problematic</a> (though it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">became increasingly more frowned upon</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a> or so). Just kill them all; it makes perfect sense. Then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiserreich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiserreich">Kaiserreich</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArmenianGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArmenianGenocide">the Ottoman Empire</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> came along <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">and did it for real</a></em>. But after the Nazis did it for real, people started to learn about the Holocaust  and to their horror <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">learned what a Final Solution actually looked like</a>, felt like, and <em>meant</em>. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, genocide, as this phenomenon was subsequently named, <em>stopped</em> being cool and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">the ultimate act of evil</a>. Likewise, in fiction, a hero might have once looked on with indifference at a whole race of enemies being exterminated, or even have approved, but now the hero would roar at the thought of a villain doing that kind of dark deed, no matter how beneficial it would be for the hero, with a cry of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane">You're Insane!</a>" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">furiously leap in battle</a> to stop the atrocity.

Of course, at the same time, villains became <em>more</em> likely to solve their problems with a Final Solution.

<ul><li> It's a bit more complicated than that: The "blood thirst" that Red Court vampires inflict on humans to turn them into vampires only mutates them into something half-human, half-vampire; only by willingly killing and drinking blood does an infected person complete the transformation. However, even before an infected person does this, he gains a lot of power and longevity... and many such people, including the older members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireRefugee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireRefugee">the Fellowship of Saint Giles</a>, suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">No Ontological Inertia</a> when the vampire part of them was suddenly exterminated. In fact, only the youngest of the infected actually survived, and one of their human allies becomes an antagonist because her understandable bitterness about this, and the fact that her friends and support system vanished overnight and left her on the streets, were exploited by some of the more manipulative villains.

It was almost carried out against the Rigellians (and orbital weapon platforms are left in place to prevent them from ever advancing to a point where they might regain space-flight) and seriously attempted against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Bugs</a> since there was no way to communicate and they treated other sentient species as food.

</li><li> Likely the largest genocide ever imagined is at the conclusion of the <em>Skylark of Space</em> series. The protagonists have before tangled with the "ameboid" Chlorans, who attack, enslave, and exploit humans (but do not exterminate them). In the earlier encounter, there was just one Chloran planet; the option of genocide (called explicitly by that name) was considered, but due to pleadings of "soft-hearted" women the milder option of sending the planet far away was taken. But when discovering a faraway galaxy with <em>millions</em> of Chloran planets, the protagonist Seaton decides that the Chlorans are "a cancer" and a danger to the entire universe and that nothing would do but to kill every single one of them  empatically rejecting any other option. He and his arch-enemy turned ally DuQuesne proceed to do just that, causing all the Chloran suns to go nova. "The Chlorans died in their uncounted trillions. The greeny-yellow soup that served them for air boiled away. Their halogenous flesh was charred, baked and dessicated in the split-second of the passing of the front wave from each exploding double star, moments before their planets themselves started to seethe and boil. Many died unaware. Most died fighting. Most died in terrible, frantic effort to escape... But they all died." Immediately afterwards, DuQuesne  feeling not the slightest remorse at having just killed <em>uncounted trillions</em> of sentient beings and destroyed an entire galaxy, proposes to his long-cherished lady love and is thrilled to hear that she truly loves him.
<ul><li> DuQuesne <em>is</em> pretty much throughout portrayed as the ultimate amoral pragmatist rather than a "hero", so it's not completely out of character for him. That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">idealistic hero</a> Seaton goes along with it, though, is a bit jarring if you don't buy that the Chlorans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>.

The Overlords of Delgon (<em>explicitly</em> tortured to death by <em>the good guys</em> whenever possible), the Eich, the Ploorans, the Eddorians themselves... at least in the case of the Eddorians (who reproduce by binary fission, with memories/personality carrying over), there's a justification for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, since they're presumably all basically clones. Also, "zwilniks" (basically, drug dealers) and "boskonians" (pirates) are treated as utterly irredeemable; a big deal is made of the one incident in the series in which a pirate crew is <em>not</em> terminated with extreme prejudice, and it's pretty much only the fact that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Unattached Lensman</a> (each of whom is, legally, a law unto himself and explicitly licensed by the government to do whatever the hell he feels like) vouches for them that saves them.

Sometimes it's correct according to Galactic laws; for example, the Bururalli species were completely destroyed after they somehow devolved, went collectively insane, and started killing everything that moved on their first unsupervised colony world. Other times, it's just a matter of a politically powerful race getting away with destroying any species they happen to dislike, as when the Jophur obliterate the g'Kek because of <em>gambling debts</em>. The Tandu species are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobes</a> who long to wipe out <em>everybody</em> else.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The obvious holders of the trope would be the Daleks  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobes</a> who want nothing but to wipe all life but themselves from the universe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dalek Caan, the <em>only</em> Dalek to date to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> without explicit mental meddling of some kind. He snapped after seeing all the horror the Daleks had unleashed across time and space when trapped in the Time Vortex. What did he do? Try and set up a new species of peaceful Daleks? Dedicate himself to a life of peace and helping others? Nope: he tried to obliterate his own species, using the Doctor as a weapon to do it with, and came very close to succeeding.</span>
</li><li> The Doctor himself has attempted genocide against the Daleks on at least three occasions; it never quite sticks  the first time, he was sent at the behest of the Time Lords to wipe them out before they came to be, but couldn't bring himself to do it. Since then, his hatred of them has been so complete that a) he very rarely offers them his usual one chance, b) at one point one of his more <em>cheerful</em> incarnations actually revels in his status as, to the Daleks, "the Devil himself", c) once he pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindMeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindMeld">Mind Meld</a> on a Dalek, "Rusty", to try and get it to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> by re-introducing it to the beauty of the universe and of life... and instead filled it with a hatred of other Daleks so pure and complete that it spent <em>billions</em> of years slaughtering its own kind. The Doctor is left both horrified and deeply depressed by this.
</li><li> As a result of this, the Daleks tend to accord him the status of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, because they find his hatred of them so beautiful  one, the Dalek Emperor, hails him as "the Great Exterminator" (though that could just have been a more or less successful attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a>), and another, the Dalek Prime Minister, severely creeps out both the Doctor and the audience by revealing that the Daleks venerate hatred - so much that they don't exterminate the Daleks dispatched to the Dalek Asylum for being too crazy to control, as it would be a crime to destroy such beautiful hatred - before idly musing that perhaps that's why they've never been able to kill him...
<ul><li> At the end of the Time War, the Doctor committed genocide on the Time Lords themselves, who had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniacs</a> (or at least, the High Council/Rassilon had)  though that had as much to do with ending the Time War, which was tearing the universe apart, as anything else. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that he didn't, instead hiding it in a pocket dimension with the help of all 13 incarnations to date, most particularly 10 and 11. However, since he forgot, thanks to not being able to remember interactions with his future selves, and the method used resulted in a very big bang, he and everyone else assumed he'd destroyed them all.</span> Since then, he keeps wiping out species, after having given them a chance to back down, mostly because he has no choice.

<ul><li> Extermination of the undesirables - under the name of "reactionary classes" - is an inbuilt feature of most if not all ideologies based on Marxism. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">Liquidation of the reactionary classes</a>" includes the bourgeoisie, the peasantry, intellectuals, entrepreneurs, Lumpenproletariat and individuals perceived as "enemies of the people". Suffice it to say, this has happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, most especially under the Soviet Union, People's Republic of China and most extensively Cambodia under Pol Pot (where up to <em>one third</em> of the population were killed or died from starvation due to disastrous policies). This has also extended sometimes to whole ethnic groups labeled as "reactionary" or deemed disloyal, for were targeted for extermination and exile to places like Siberia, where many died from hardship even when not actively killed. Cultural genocide is also something Communist states practiced, attempting to wipe out religion (with varying degrees or harshness), any cultural practices they felt were "backward" and of course the aforementioned "reactionary classes" if not killed would be wiped out (or else the attempt made at least) in every other sense, since they had no place in the future "worker's paradise").
</li><li> Similarly, Nazi ideology had wiping out Jews, Slavs, the disabled and other "undesirables" as core features, at least judging by most assessments. At the very least, they had no problem with doing so if this was deemed necessary or anyone was designated "useless eaters" (for instance, there were proposals that some Slavs be spared for use as slave labor, at least temporarily). Their war in the Soviet Union was really one of extermination, with accordingly the war's highest casualty rates as millions were murdered (either civilians or POWs). Earlier forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism">Social Darwinism</a> also openly called for exterminating people and race wars (although not all were that extreme), while negative eugenics often did as well (though they usually tried to frame it as also "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">mercy killing</a>"-the Nazis also claimed that in their Aktion T4 "euthanasia" program, yet conversely proclaimed the victims were just "life unworthy of life" or a waste of resources).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> has many cases of this:

Only Lot and his two daughters evacuate safely; his son-in-laws don't believe him, and his wife is turned into a pillar of salt when she turns to look back.

However, they weren't entirely successful, and so the Israelites intermingled with the foreign nations and their practices. Some exceptions though occurred:
<ul><li> The prostitute Rahab, who assisted Israel's spies, and her family were spared during the siege and fall of Jericho.
</li><li> The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites by telling them that they were from a distant land instead, and had them swear an oath to spare them. Naturally, the Israelites were disgruntled when they learned the truth, and made the Gibeonites subservient to them. However, the Israelites still defended them when other kings marched to war against them.
</li><li> About 350 years later, God rejected Saul as Israel's king after Saul spared the king of the Amelekites and their livestock.
</li><li> After David replaced Saul as king, he makes reparations to the Gibeonites who were unjustly treated and murdered by Saul.

<ul><li> The former is a mad scientist race who take over planets and experiment on the population, then clean up their mess by killing everyone so there are no witnesses. Quite tidy.
</li><li> The latter is a sentient virus. It is colonies of the virus that are sentient, so every infected human or animal counts as one intelligent "virus colony individual".

Oh, and they are pretty fond of exterminating sentient extraterrestrials as well when they get the chance to do some "purging", and a willingness to coexist with humanity will <em>not</em> save you  at least two cultures exhibiting human/xenos collaboration were exterminated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> books, as well as countless purely alien cultures. The Imperium's genocidal tendencies are such that, across much of the setting, they are a You Must Be This Tall To Ride sign  if your species isn't capable of surviving both the Imperium and the Orks, it's not going to make it to the tabletop.
<ul><li> This is a major goal of the Orks. Being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a> they seek to fight all they see and eventually kill it, although they do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">greatly respect</a> enemies who prove difficult or impossible to kill.

</li></ul></li><li> According to a blurb from the 3rd Edition Eldar codex, this is their plan for us humans if their race ever gets out of the rut they're in.

</li><li> Absolute genocide is the presumable goal of the Tyranids, though they may just be biological weapons for another race.
</li><li> The T'au don't so much <em>want</em> to commit genocide as view it as an ugly but necessary tool.

As a result, the Tau policy for any world that proves both impossible to negotiate with and impossible to cost-effectively subjugate is to wipe them out, and with some races  most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Orks</a>  they've concluded that negotiation and subjugation are just wasting time on people incapable of even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">comprehending</a></em> peace and cut straight to extermination.

The various Earthling nations and companies are willing to help native peoples in enacting this on their long term enemies and the Nazis will do this personally.

Then, when the krogan decided to use the advanced technology that the salarians had given them to wage their own war of conquest, the salarians designed the Genophage, which caused 99.9% of krogan offspring to die during gestation. Whether the latter action constituted genocide is heavily debated in-universe.
<ul><li> Before the Genophage, krogan reproduction was positively explosive. Their home planet was so harsh that a 99.9% fatality rate kept their reproduction in check. Once uplifted to the galactic community and in control of planets much much safer than their home, their rapid reproduction was quite worrying. The Genophage was introduced to keep their 99.9% fatality rate from their homeworld's extreme conditions intact regardless of where they settled. This is why the Genophage is still debated, and not just accepted as a clear-cut genocide.

All it knows is that it was once "wretched" before its exaltation. And the worst part? Their inability to reproduce is self-inflicted.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a>, a collation of real-life campaigns against various "undesirables" organised by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazis</a> and carried out by various parties including their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">allies and puppets</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Everyone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> on down used euphemistic language to refer to these campaigns, with the anti-Jewish element eventually coming under the term "die Endlösung der Judenfrage" ("the Final Solution to the Jewish Question"). In early 1941, Hitler was also keen to stress that the coming Soviet-German War was to be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar">a war of annihilation</a>" (Vernichtungskrieg) in which the Soviet peoples would ultimately be destroyed, the Wehrmacht heartily agreeing and issuing a series of decrees (on 'foraging', against commissars, and against 'bandits') to ensure that it would be.
</li><li> The other most prominent member of the Axis Powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Imperial Japan</a>, conducted widespread war crimes in World War II, the worst of their killings occurring during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, in which many millions of Chinese were deliberately murdered, tortured, and raped as part of Japanese efforts to bring the larger nation under their heel. The most infamous of these war crimes being the Nanking Massacre, the activities of Unit 731, and the Three Alls Policy (Kill all, burn all, loot all). Other Asian nations conquered by Japan were not spared from horror, however, with the Philipino capital of Manila being deliberately destroyed, millions dying in a famine in Vietnam, and four million Indonesians having died during that country's occupation.
</li><li> While the Holocaust may be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, the term "Final Solution" was also used in the American government's attempts to <a class="urllink" href="http://english.stackexchange.com/a/365582/115108">eradicate/assimilate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the Native population in the 19th and early 20th century. Initially, the plan was to eradicate the Indians, but (slightly) saner heads prevailed and then the plan turned into assimilation.
<div class="indent"> [I]n the United States, discussions of "the Indian problem [or question]" and its "final solution" go back to at least 1869. In the earliest commentaries, the envisaged "final solution" tended to be genocide. But within a few years, the discussion shifted to assimilationeducation in the white Western (and Christian) tradition, pastoral skills training, and U.S. citizenship under these supposedly civilizing influences.
</div><ul><li> Perhaps the most severe example was what is now known as the California Genocide. While in most other cases, US Federal and State authorities sought to violently subjugate or forcibly relocate native tribes, in California, what can essentially be described as a policy of extermination was put in place. Systematic killings were widespread and enslavement of American Indians was <em>de facto</em> legalized. This resulted in up to 90% American Indian population in the state being destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> The colonial army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">Imperial Germany</a> committed the first genocide of the 20th century against the Herero and Namaqua people in what is now Namibia, killing at least 80,000. Overall, the population of both was at least halved through mass executions, starvation, and forced labor. Medical experiments illegal under German domestic law were conducted upon children. There's a causal link between Imperial German 'Colonial Activities' and Nazi German policies in its colonies of Poland and the USSR, where The Holocaust first began and then escalated to its final form as a series of administrative processes. Lothar von Trotha, the general in charge of the genocide, also sounds eerily similar to Hitler's rants in his remarks concerning the killings.
</li><li> Also, naturally, all of the many attempted genocides that the 20th century witnessed, like the Rwandan Genocide in 1994 (radical Hutus murdering the Tutsis and any Hutu with a conscience), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArmenianGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArmenianGenocide">the Armenian Genocide</a> in 1915 (Turks trying to kill all Armenians in their territory, and succeeding in exiling the survivors don't talk about this in modern-day Turkey if you wish to stay out of jail), along with the related Assyrian and Greek genocides.
<div class="indent"> <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToObscurity">Who remembers the Armenians?</a>"</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, August 22, 1939
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>, like Hitler, was notorious for his genocidal acts of mass murder. One of the most infamous of these was the Holodomor, a famine he engineered/allowed to happen that killed millions of Ukrainians (and others). Stalin also attempted to exterminate entire social classes, such as the <em>kulaks</em> (independent Ukrainian and Russian farmers, whom Soviet propaganda demonized as being obese, decadent, and the cause of all the poor peasants' ills), as well as all political opposition. These campaigns are part of the reason that extermination based on social class or political ideology was not included in the official UN definition of genocide: the definition was written by the victorious Allies of WWII, of which Josef Stalin was one.
</li><li> Another prominent Soviet example is Decossackization, which began under Lenin and continued under Stalin. This policy was designed to wipe out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks">Cossacks</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11jwhw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11jwhw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11jwhw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Self-governing, militaristic communities (or "hosts") residing mainly in southern Russia and Ukraine</span> as a distinct culture. This included mass killings, though forced resettlement accounted for much of the campaign. The campaign was essentially successful and resulted in the Cossack "hosts" ceasing to exist as nations. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some efforts by descendants of Cossacks to revive their identity and traditions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a> was also a proponent of "classicide", which was particularly prevalent during the Communist Party's first land reform campaign of 1949-1953. This involved the violent extermination of the entire landlord class and the redistribution of their lands to the peasantry. Many of these were executed in "struggle sessions", a form of torture where authorities induced locals to participate in humiliating, injuring, and often killing landlords in public spectacles. Estimates of those killed range from several hundred thousand at the lowest to five million at the highest. Ironically, the peasants would soon lose their newly distributed land after the Communist Party collectivized agriculture and placed all farmland under state ownership.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> allegedly did this to a Gallic tribe (note: not all of them), but it seems more probable that he only had most of their noblemen killed. Generally, he preferred diplomacy over mass murder. He <em>claimed</em> that he'd exterminated several tribes in his book <em>The Gallic War</em>, but that may have been simply boasting.
</li><li> Romans did execute measures at least very close to this trope in their history. The populations of Corinth and Carthage (both in 146 BC) were massacred (most fighting men) or taken as slaves (most women and children) and the cities themselves were burned to the ground. This was about as close as it came to the spirit of the trope in the Roman Republic.
</li><li> In the ancient period, the successful siege of a resisting city usually meant the extermination of the adult males and the enslavement of the women and children (bear in mind, this only happened if the city resisted and fought to the end. If the city surrendered, it would be subjected to far lighter treatment, proportionate to the length of the siege; a city that had surrendered as soon as the enemy showed up would usually be spared everything but the tiniest bit of looting, while a city that put up a fight for a while before giving up might expect to see a day or two of rape and pillage).
</li><li> The Mongols used this as a tactic: they would kill most of the people in the cities that fought them, leaving only enough survivors to spread the stories about their atrocities. This gave nearby cities serious incentive to surrender outright.
<ul><li> When the Mongols entered Baghdad, it was the jewel of the Islamic empire, crossroads of three continents, and renowned as a center of trade, culture, and learning. They didn't call it the Fertile Crescent to be ironic. Long story short, none of that still applies. In more detail: the Mongols depopulated the city so thoroughly it didn't recover its 1258 population until the mid <strong>19</strong>60s, destroyed the Grand Library until the Tigris river ran black with ink and red with blood, destroyed the millennia-old irrigation network that made the Fertile Crescent fertile, and generally did everything they could to turn one of the most advanced cities on the planet into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">what we now think of Baghdad</a> even 700 years later.
</li><li> It is estimated that the Mongols exterminated 90% of Iran's population. For comparison, Hitler killed less than 40% of Jews in Europe. In total, they killed between 30 million and 60 million people at a time when the global population was around 400 million.
</li></ul></li><li> The ancient Assyrians used the same tactic as the Mongol example above  usually leaving extensive stelae with lurid descriptions of the shocking details.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame">Timur the Lame</a>, a prince of a Turkicized Mongol people and a Chinggisid by marriage, also engaged in scary exterminations (he shared the Mongol penchant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkulls">giant heaps of skulls</a>).
</li><li> Many of the early wars between European settlers and the native North and South Americans came down to this; it wasn't uncommon for small settlements on both sides to be completely exterminated. King Philip's War is probably the best known of these, and probably the worst in terms of percentage of the population killed. Though this is also <em>greatly</em> exaggerated. While it is true that the Europeans wiped out numerous indigenous tribes, the number one killer was disease. Contrary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>, there is only one known instance of an attempt to use smallpox as a biological weapon, and it is unclear that it was successful. Most of the death from the epidemics came prior to extensive European contact, as the diseases raced ahead of the settlers; it is thought that roughly 90% of the population of the native population of the Americas perished in this way, with many civilizations disappearing, collapsing, merging with other nearby groups, or dying off entirely. In fact, some historians have said that without smallpox, the European conquest would have been far more difficult, or may not even have fully succeeded at all.
</li><li> Subverted in terms of historiography. Many scribes very deliberately exaggerated how much damage a war caused, often using such high numbers in their accounts that the opposing force would be practically exterminated, which would be at odds with the later wars that occurred. The very fact that they felt exaggerating how many of the enemy they slaughtered was good is itself chilling however.
</li><li> When the Maori invaded the Chatham Islands, they systematically murdered at least 10% of the native Moriori population, some by torture, then enslaved the remaining people and prevented them from marrying or having children with each other. As if genocide needed to be any more horrific, the Moriori lived by a code of absolute non-violence and made no attempt to fight back. They refused to give it up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism">even in the face of certain death</a>. Even worse: the Moriori were originally Maori who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">had tired of the violent, militaristic Maori society and left to form their own, non-violent society</a>. Their own cousins came later and wiped out many of them.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalReorganizationProcess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalReorganizationProcess">National Reorganization Process</a>, the Argentine military attempted what would be properly termed "politicide" against the nation's leftist elements, with the goal of a Final Solution to the Communist problem. Up to 30,000 people were tortured and killed, most of them guilty of nothing more than being more to the left than the hard-right junta. As part of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, many victims of the military dictatorship met similar agonizing fates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin">Idi Amin</a> committed acts of ethnic cleansing against the Acholi and Lango peoples during his rule over Uganda, first purging them from the military and then targeting civilians. This was partly because they made up a large part of the support base for the previous dictator, Milton Obote, who Amin had overthrown, and partly due to Amin's anti-Christian sentiment.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia">Cambodian Genocide</a> lasted from 1975 until 1979,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12m9ov');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12m9ov" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12m9ov');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and even then stayed on a very small scale until just before the nineties</span> and is widely considered the second-worst genocide of the 20th century (let's just say, when North Vietnam and even <em>China</em> pan their humans rights record, you know it's bad). It all began when the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot and backed by communist Vietnam, took over Cambodia. Within his just-over 5 years of absolute power,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note134ruk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note134ruk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note134ruk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As has been said, while his actual rule of Cambodia lasted nearly 6 years, the KR still had rule of a small territory up north and were recognized as "official" for many years</span> he had turned Cambodia into an 8 million man company (by the end 6 million), made rice the only legal food, forced people to eat at only designated times, made it illegal to even <em>believe</em> in a god, made it illegal to be part of the "intelligentsia" (doctors, teachers, people with degrees, and people who even wore <em>glasses</em>), evacuated entire cities (including the hospitals), and finally forced <em>everyone</em> (even people without legs or the terminally ill) to farm for the rest of their lives. A lot of ethnic cleansing was carried out because Pol Pot wanted a "pure", rural Kampuchea. Foreigners were killed, anyone who was religious was killed, old government members were killed (the royal prince joined the KR, so was spared), and people who couldn't farm (accused of "sabotage") were killed. Also noteworthy in that unlike other genocides (namely the Holocaust), the KR did absolutely nothing to remove evidence of what they did and to this day their biggest prison, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">the S-21</a>" (a former high school<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14f6fq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14f6fq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14f6fq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Part of Pol Pot's campaign to kill off "intelligentsia" was by closing all the schools down and banning education. Some of them, such as this one, became prisons.</span>), is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and is filled with photos of actual tortures/executions, paintings by a survivor, mug shots of the condemned, and piles and piles of <em>skulls</em>. It is no wonder that of over 20,000 prisoners, only 12 survived.
</li><li> In the late 1980s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a> ordered what is now known as the Anfal genocide against Iraq's Kurdish population in retaliation for a rebellion in Iraqi Kurdistan. The genocide was organized and led by Ali Hassan al-Majid, who was known as "Chemical Ali" for his use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">Deadly Gas</a>. As many as 182,000 Kurds may have been killed.
</li><li> The Yugoslav Civil Wars featured war crimes by all sides, and deliberate genocide on the part of the Serbian and Croatian governments, with Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia (and its clients in the Republika Srpska) going the extra mile to ensure the "ethnic cleansing" of their territory.
</li><li> Based on archaeological evidence, a genocide occurred between two groups of Anasazi people of the Southwestern United States around 800 CE.
</li><li> People easily forget that pathogens, be they bacteriological or virological, are living things.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15x9zr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15x9zr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15x9zr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Viruses are barely classified as life, but they are still self-replicating DNA/RNA chains.</span> When scientists eliminate a disease, they are voluntarily causing the extinction of a species. Which no one bats an eye at because said species are considered lower than insects and other pests - which people also freely use the Final Solution against when infesting any place populated by humans.
</li><li> In 1804, Haitian Revolution leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines ordered that Haiti's remaining population of whites be put to death, justifying it as being for the sake of national security. By the end of the massacre, the white Haitians were practically eradicated except for a few exceptions like Polish and German foreigners and any white women that agreed to marry Dessalines' men. Dessalines made no attempt to hide this genocide from the world, and the "Horrors of St. Domingo" would be used to justify the continuation of slavery in the Southern United States and Imperial Brazil for decades to come, by claiming a successful slave revolt there would also result in them (or that simply freeing the slaves might).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">Islamic State of Syria and Iraq</a> is guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">several genocides</a> against native groups in their domains, including Eastern Christians, Shia Muslims (regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">"non-Muslims" by many fanatical Sunnis</a>), and the Yazidis, with the last one being singled out as their most hated group because the Yazidis revere a peacock angel that is similar to the Iblis (the Devil in Islam) and ISIS regards them as "sorcerers". Not only did they not even try to hide or deny the Yazidi persecution as with many of their online supporters had, but the group actually <em>boasted</em> about it, attempted to use it as <em>recruitment tool</em> by offering female Yazidi as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">concubines</a> to anyone that joined them, and rebuked their supporters for trying to whitewash them. Considering their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">aims</a>, they would have expanded the final solution to anything that didn't fit with their doctrine.
