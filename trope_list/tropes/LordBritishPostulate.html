<div class="indent">— <strong>Mike Schramm</strong>, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203061023/http://wow.joystiq.com/2007/03/28/wow-moviewatch-adal-downed/">WoW Insider<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>
</div></div><p>If a game designer wants an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPC</a> to be invulnerable, they'd better make sure that it truly <em>is</em>.
</p><p>The Lord British Postulate was coined in <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203061023/http://wow.joystiq.com/2007/03/28/wow-moviewatch-adal-downed/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>WoW Insider</em> post, and is the cornerstone of the creativity and ingenuity of the more cunning player. In short, if a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a> cannot be killed through normal means, then there <em>must</em> be some <em>abnormal</em> means to do the job. Quite often, if a character's weapons fail to do the duty, then the task falls upon other NPCs, world objects, or the environment to assassinate the relevant target with some prodding from the player characters. The Lord British Postulate is not restricted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a>, but can be applied elsewhere: C<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS">FPSes</a>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Tabletop RPGs</a>.

That said, the Lord British Postulate has less grounding in reality than one would assume. A great number of NPCs are free to walk around unmolested, safe in their invulnerability. However, the more important the NPC is, the more likely it will be the target of a creative assassination attempt. A king is a bigger target than the common baker and much more satisfying to dispatch.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a> III</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">sub-boss</a> Ceres is supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">unbeatable</a> (you are told to endure the battle until time runs out without getting killed), but it is possible to beat Ceres if you attack very quickly and break his guard. Probably because the game designers didn't intend you to beat him, nothing special happens after you do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightersDestiny">Fighters Destiny</a></em> and its sequel have a minigame where the objective is to stay in the ring as long as possible against a seemingly invincible bull. In reality, the bull can fall off the stage, though if this happens the round ends as if <em>you</em> fell.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>, the supposedly invincible Wario-Man, as well as characters using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp">Starman</a>, can both be KO'd in the conventional fashion by chucking a Team Healer item at them while they're at a high enough percentage and not on your team. On a similar note, while Giga Bowser is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">Immune to Flinching</a>, he can still be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky">star KO'd</a> if he's hit while he's off the top of the screen.
<ul><li> This also extends to several additional characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">the fourth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">and fifth games</a> who can be hurt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">but not flinched or knocked back</a> during their Final Smash, namely Lucario, Charizard, and Little Mac (who transform into Mega Lucario, Mega Charizard X, and Giga Mac, respectively).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools">Rival Schools</a></em>, when playing story mode, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">an early battle with the final boss</a> and a brainwashed student. He's supposed to beat the player so they get brainwashed as well, which is a part of the story. He has insane attack and very high defense; however, very high defense doesn't mean invulnerability, so a skilled player can still beat him. Doing so will make you skip most of the story and throw you straight to the last battle with a heavily weakened version of the boss compared to the one you just beat.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    First Person Shooters </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>, a glitch involving using two controllers at once allows the player to fire on characters <em>during cutscenes</em> from the camera's perspective, instantly killing any that are hit. This includes Baron Samedi during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOrIsIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOrIsIt">The End... Or Is It?</a> moment. This has no gameplay impact whatsoever, though.
<ul><li> A similar trick is to place explosives where a character will appear during a cutscene. The villian gets two words into their spiel before flying face-first across the room.
</li></ul></li><li> The Jedi Heroes in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a></em> game were invulnerable to normal weapons; they would deflect blasters and simply get knocked down by splash damage. It is possible to kill them by using grenades or heavy weapons to knock them into environmental hazards: off the edge of Cloud City, into the Sarlacc pit, or into the Carbonite Freezing chamber. It is also possible to kill them by landing aircraft on them or ramming them at a fast enough speed with a speeder bike.
<ul><li> An even easier method is to get them between a few turrets firing at the right rate. The flinch effect will keep them immobilized long enough for you to take them out. Sadly, they'd just respawn like Agents in <em>The Matrix</em>.
</li><li> You could also do this by using a vehicle to push said Jedi off the playable area; though this will kill you eventually, it'll also kill the Jedi, which will (for whatever reason) not damage your vehicle whatsoever. This works great with the Republic and Empire's tank, which has noticeable projections on the sides that can completely trap the Jedi in front of it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> has plenty of invincible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, but many can be killed due to a collision bug. Get one to stand on the edge of a piece of furniture, then push the furniture against a wall. They will pass partially through the wall and then die instantly as the game seems to think they've been crushed.
<ul><li> Anna Navarre and Gunther Hermann are the reverse; the game forces confrontations, and they're immune to any non-lethal damage. Naturally, players immediately started finding ways to spare them (but the game acts as though JC killed them anyway).
</li><li> Walton Simons is not invulnerable during the cutscene, so a well-timed and well-placed high-explosive shot from either the GEP or assault rifle will hit and kill him during his speech.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a></em>, important NPCs aren't coded to be invincible, but are simply placed in areas where you can't use your weapons, or speak with you from behind bulletproof glass. One such important NPC, Billie Adams, can be seen at the beginning of the game running into an inaccessible booth before speaking with you. It's possible to kill her before she gets into the booth. This removes her from the game, but in later encounters there will be gaps in the dialogue where she was supposed to be, because the game was never programmed to deal with her not being alive.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the engine <em>does</em> support flagging NPCs as unkillable  though any NPC flagged as such is in a place where weapons are disabled, with one obscure exception, so most players will not notice. Why Billie is not flagged this way is unclear.
</li><li> One side-quest has a canopy with a weapon and a scientist. Open the canopy with a button press and the scientist gets locked behind an indestructable door. Kill the scientist and the canopy locks down instead, denying you the weapon. To achieve both, place a metal box so that the door cannot close, open the canopy, get the weapon, and then head for the scientist. Get a melee weapon and hack away (which will really take a while due to obscene amounts of health). For your effort, you get chided from one faction for helping the other, but later still get their award as well as the other faction's bonus.
</li></ul></li><li> Prior to being patched out, it was possible to kill Eli Vance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>. The player's attacks don't hurt him at all, but if you grabbed a sentry gun from earlier in the level, carried it all the way to Eli, and set it down facing him, it would quickly blow him away.
<ul><li> Another fun thing to do? Start a new game, get God mode going, get the HEV suit, THEN use <em>Impulse 101</em> running. Get ammo and the crossbow, and follow the steps up to the teleport cutscene. As you are transporting from place to place, you can <em>headshot Breen</em> either place; when he first sees you and you fade out, or when he rounds his desk.
</li><li> The physics engine can be exploited to kill certain otherwise-invulnerable NPCs using the Gravity Gun and nearby physics objects, and done at the proper times, you can avoid triggering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> where you would otherwise receive one. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhm-dPS3zM8">Observe.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em> the final boss <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shub-Niggurath</span> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> you are <em>meant</em> to kill by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">Tele-Frag</a> by entering a certain teleporter at the right time. However, she is not immune to the player's weapons and initially had only 40000 health, which, while being too much to make shooting her to death practical, meant it was not impossible to do if you used cheats to get more ammo and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage">Quad Damage</a> and were really persistant. As she didn't have any "death state" programmed in, killing her this way would cause the game to crash. This was eventually fixed with a patch that made it so her health keeps resetting to 40000, making her unkillable by weapon damage.

<ul><li> Lord British, of course, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> series, who just happens to be one of Richard Garriott's two in-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a>. The postulate itself stems from <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140811220739/http://www.gamestooge.com/2009/01/02/feature-the-day-lord-british-died/">a time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline">Ultima Online</a></em> beta test where, following a crash, Lord British' invulnerability flag was unknowingly turned off, and a player killed him with a hastily-stolen firefield spell on the spur of the moment during a public gathering. The guards moved in, the players fought back, and the whole thing turned into an in-game riot.
<ul><li> A special pair of leggings were introduced to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.uoguide.com/Royal_Leggings_of_Embers">"commemorate" the event<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> There was an event during the early weeks of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa">Tabula Rasa</a></em> that was about killing General British. Well, clones of him, actually; there were dozens of them.
</li></ul></li><li> Most NPCs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> are actually killable to players of the opposing faction, including racial leaders such as Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and the like. However, most NPCs in the neutral city of Shattrath <em>should</em> be invulnerable, as combat from players is forbidden there... unless, of course, one pulls an enemy from <em>outside</em> of the city <em>into</em> it and lets them run loose on the population. The main NPC of the city, a massive naaru named A'dal, was killed in this way several times until it was buffed to nigh-unkillable levels. It seems that the original A'dal had very few HP. Even more uncanny is that after death, it just keeps hanging there despite being considered a corpse by game mechanics; naaru don't even have a death animation!
<ul><li> It's still possible to kill A'dal with a quest mob that becomes immune to everything at 50% health (you need a quest item to kill him). It just takes a very very very long time. In theory, it would also be possible to kite said mob to A'dal, then kite him away, effectively kiting A'dal itself (and every guard in the city). There is a rumor of this being done, but there are no videos to back it up.
</li><li> The pre-launch event of the second expansion involved an infection that would turn player characters into zombies that were hostile towards everything but each other. You can use this opportunity to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> that were otherwise unattackable to both factions.
</li><li> Early on in the third expansion, the infamous Goon Squad guild managed to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">Tirion Fordring</a> during a cutscene by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onWY4Q0hIjU">luring a miniboss from earlier in the Icecrown Citadel raid to him<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, something that shouldn't normally be possible given that they were already at the <em>final boss.</em> Turned out they actually bypassed said miniboss by deliberately dying and rezzing to reset its aggro, and then got its attention right before teleporting to Arthas  upon which the miniboss <em>clipped straight up through the tower</em> and into the Lich King arena. This had since been patched out after the glitch was discovered.
</li><li> The Whale Shark is an immense boss mob with no loot of any kind and the ability to one-shot anybody that attacks it. Nonetheless, Blizzard had to add an achievement for killing it because so many people wanted to.
</li><li> Some players expand this to include other players when not in PvP situations that allow deaths. Duels end with the other player having one hitpoint, but using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knockback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knockback">knockback</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind control</a> during the duel, it is possible to kill via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingDamage">fall damage</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps the worst incident of this behavior was the Corrupted Blood Plague. Players discovered they could bring a highly-contagious disease to their home cities, where it would promptly spread and kill characters who were ordinarily protected from other players.
</li><li> Early in the <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> beta, there was a bugged version of Chi Wave. The spell is supposed to bounce between PCs and NPCs, healing if friendly, damaging if an enemy. Earlier versions were bugged so it would damage all NPCs.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, a well-placed herd of Necromancer minions can sometimes kill exactly the wrong person during a mission cutscene.
<ul><li> The <em>Eye of the North</em> expansion is far more explicit with this. If an allied NPC is killed, it will either return hale and hearty on the next dungeon level or, more commonly, wait until its aggro circle is clear before standing back up, dusting itself off, and running back to your location. Quite a few NPCs will rubberband back up to about 30% if their health drops below this threshold, even if the damage they receive puts them deep into negative health. Of course, it was possible for decorative player minipets and certain resurrection NPCs to be accidentally killed by rolling ice boulders when they shouldn't, but this was quickly patched.
</li><li> One month, it was discovered that a specific buff could be used to spawn minions in some outposts by gaming the system slightly. As players do not have access to skills in outposts, the minions would quickly kill them, and their corpses would spawn more minions.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em>'s Scars of Velious expansion pack existed a prismatic dragon known as Kerafyrm the Sleeper. His very existence was deemed a crime against dragonkind, and he was magically sealed in a hidden tomb, guarded by four wardens who would keep him asleep for all eternity. Once those 4 wardens were killed, Kerafyrm was scripted to wake up and sow havoc and destruction upon certain areas of the continent, killing certain NPCs in the process. One of the most noteworthy examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">Temporary Online Content</a>  Kerafyrm could only be awakened <em>once</em> per server, and the game world was permanently changed to reflect his awakening. The first server to awaken him discovered this harsh truth without knowing. Some servers followed afterward thinking this was an accomplishment, and many tried to fight Kerafyrm with the intent of killing him. People were supposed to think they could win, and be on the end of a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">Player Punch</a> when they inevitably lose. They couldn't make him actually unkillable because you weren't supposed to know it was hopeless, but once the first group to wake him found out, no one else would do it, because there is no benefit from trying and failing. Many servers discovered that the loot that dropped from the wardens that kept him asleep was far superior than the loot from the bosses that would replace them once the zone was changed to reflect the awakening. Most servers signed truces for the sake of farming the superior gear, but guilds would eventually one by one wake him up across each server. Ironically, it was the Rallos Zek server, the original PVP server that launched among the game's 12 original servers, that honored this truce the longest. After a few years of honorably farming the wardens for loot, the top 3 guilds on the server decided to band together and prove that Kerafyrm could be killed. Once word got out, Player Killer guilds tried to grief the server by prematurely awakening him, but they all failed. It took over 200 players just over 3 hours using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> tactics against a dragon who was immune to all forms of magic except for the Shadowknight class' Harm Touch and the Wizard class' Mana Burn, but in the end, the dragon fell, and his corpse had no loot. A few weeks later, a game-wide announcement was told of the accomplishment.
<ul><li> And while we're on the subject, Verant had to make characters used in GM events untargetable specifically <em>because</em> of this problem.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzlePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzlePirates">Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates</a></em> has El Pollo Diablo, the black ship that appears if players attack ships weaker than themselves too often. It can't be shot, and it's crewed by (noq) 150 skeletons, but it has been defeated multiple times, each matched by a severe upgrade by the developers...
<ul><li> ...Except the one time they accidentally botched the ship to be crewed by just 8 skeletons.
</li><li> Further, the hardest defeat so far, 100 skeletons versus a full Grand Frigate of top players, had one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Masters</a> fighting on the Black Ship, for full Lord British Postulate goodness, no less!
</li></ul></li><li> In the MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>, one update introduced a new enemy, the Vyrewatch. Vyrewatch read your mind to avoid hits, and so were essentially invincible despite having a combat level. And then some player with a lot of patience went to the trouble of getting one to attack him while friends re-stocked him with rings of recoil (which reflect a small amount of your enemy's damage back to them) and massive amounts of food. Eventually the Vyrewatch died, with no death animation or drops, since the developers hadn't expected somebody to actually kill them. Later updates have introduced special weapons capable of hitting Vyrewatch, removing their invincibility.
<ul><li> Another more game-breaking variant existed for a brief period when the Mindspike staff was introduced. What was normally a very early level item that was meant to facilitate unlimited elemental runes albeit a very low statted weapon it came with a special attack that would deal weapon damage to an NPC... any NPC, including those which did not have any combat stats or health leading to the deaths of such NPCs as Bankers and many quest-starting NPC which would take quite a while to respawn naturally.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> had Absolute Virtue, whose absurdly high HP, auto-regen, and a spell that restores all his health meant it was borderline invincible through legitimate means. The developers designed Absolute Virtue to be defeated in a very specific way. If players found a different way to defeat it, which happened somewhat frequently, the developers did not negate their victory, but did patch the boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">to make it impossible for that method to work again</a>. The devs never allowed Absolute Virtue to finally go down until the level cap was raised past 75, several years after its release, at which point the level difference allowed players to simply muscle through it.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, which tries very hard to make towns a safe zone where <em>you</em> can't die, by never placing enemies there, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingDamage">Falling Damage</a> never kill you outside combat, and not giving any suicide abilities. However, if you get a poison debuff from a high-level enemy and <em>quickly</em> warp to town and switch to a low-level class, you can indeed die in a town. A handful of players make it their personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> to spend the majority of their time online dead in front of major town fixtures.
<ul><li> With the addition of Blue Mage in <em>Stormblood</em>, it is entirely possible for players to simply kill themselves by casting Self-Destruct, an AOE spell that reduces the caster's HP to zero upon execution. It was quite common to see towns and cities full of dead Blue Mages when the job was new, though a patch reduced how much one could spam Self-Destruct by applying a debuff that prevents the player from blowing themselves up again for 10 minutes after being revived.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has the Hamidon, a giant blob monster, which was similarly very difficult to kill. For the first year or so, players kept coming up with strategies, only to have the Devs change the rules. Eventually, the players found an "acceptable" strategy and raiding began in earnest.
<ul><li> CoH also has Riechsman, who's supposed to be completely invincible... however, when he first came out, he was still susceptible to Sleep abilities, which, while not killing him, completely mitigated him. Also, later on in the same set of missions, you get the means to defeat him... which you can keep, then do the story over again, and use the same weapons to defeat him when you're supposed to be helpless against him!
</li><li> The Rikti Invasion events in City of Heroes feature dropships, which the dev team made virtually unkillable, with oodles of hit points, powerful attacks, and a tendency to simply fly away and escape before anybody can kill it, and which give no rewards for defeat, specifically because they were not intended to be defeated. When the Issue that introduced the Invasion events was in beta, a group of players took this as a challenge, banded together, and killed <em>nine</em> of them. The devs then made them even tougher, but still not unkillable.
</li><li> Similarly, when the Rikti Invasion events went live, the expected response was that players would flee from invasion sites  after all, the zone was being flooded with extremely powerful enemies who gave no experience or rewards for beating them. Instead, as soon as dropships appeared in the skies, every player anywhere remotely nearby rushed into the fray. They're <em>superheroes</em> and the city is being <em>invaded by aliens</em>; beating back the invaders turned out to be its own reward.
</li><li> On a smaller scale, the "Magic Man" arc has the eponymous character who, during your battle against him, uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to heal himself repeatedly when his health gets low. Mechanically, this is implemented as a new copy of the NPC running in while the low-health NPC copy gets flagged as invisible and untargetable, but <em>not</em> untouchable. Area-effect attacks and pets can still hit the old copy, and you can get XP and drops for defeating him as many as five times.
</li><li> The finale of the first chapter of the villain "Who Will Die" arc ends with five high-level, high-rank hero NPCs arriving to drive the player character off. These NPCs are twenty levels above the player characters (in a game where a seven-level difference is considered insurmountable), but have no special protection. Player speculation is that concentrating confusion attacks on the healer NPC would get her to wipe out the other heroes, but nobody has claimed to have actually done so, and that still leaves the problem of defeating an incredibly tough NPC with self-healing abilities.
</li><li> It's not killing, but turrets are implemented as ordinary NPCs that are prevented from moving with a stupidly high immobilization debuff. A sufficiently patient player can stack immobilization protection on one until it jumps off its pedestal and goes wandering around.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>, Justiciar in Canada is positioned dangerously close to a pair of explosive barrels which respawn. So long as no one's Nemesis minions show up to draw him into combat (and thus full heal him when he returns to his default position), a persistent player can kill him with the explosive damage from the barrels.
<ul><li> Another instance of this were statues in one of the endgame lairs. These statues were immune to all damage types, and shot lasers out of their eyes when approached, which the player had to use a mirror to reflect back at the statue to destroy it to progress through the lair. However, characters who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Parry</a> could actually guard to <em>penetrate the statue's immunity to normal damage</em>, allowing players to bypass complex mirror puzzles by just waiting in front of statues while blocking.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, CONCORD serves as the police force in high security systems and will attack players who perform certain illegal acts, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">attacking other players without provocation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">attacking a CONCORD ship</a>, entering high-sec space with a low security rating, etc. If a player commits such an act, an endless stream of CONCORD ships will very quickly enter the system and destroy the player's ship. Due to their weapons and equipment, most Concordokkened players don't even have a chance to fire a shot at them. There was one case, however, called the Yulai Incident, where a well-organized and well-prepared gang was actually able to hold off CONCORD for over <em>two hours</em>, killing over a hundred people in a supposedly safe system.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1cuf3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1cuf3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1cuf3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the interested, they were able to pull this off because their shield and armor boosting ships didn't get flagged by CONCORD. That was considered a bug and was quickly fixed.</span> CONCORD has since been upgraded (and continues to be upgraded every time anybody tries to tank them) and everyone involved was banned (tanking CONCORD is considered an exploit and a bannable offense), but the Yulai Incident lives on in legend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a></em> has a number of "invincible" monsters, usually seen but not directly encounted in inaccessible areas of dungeons. Most of them have enormous HP reserves and full health regeneration. This hasn't stopped players from using high-level characters with powerful ranged weapons/attacks to attack Aussircaex, a level 32 dragon (player cap is 25 currently). However, this is usually true only in the first dungeon they're encountered in - most are quest-end bosses in separate adventures, since Turbine is aware that players are going to attack anything targetable.
</li><li> The proto-MORPG AberMUD featured a dragon which had 4x the hit points possible for a level capped player, and did approximately the same damage per round as the best weapon in the game. It was, however, able to be killed in one hit if you had a specific unique (as in, one copy in the entire game world at a time) weapon equipped. Naturally, a few people took this as not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">a puzzle to be solved</a> but a challenge.
<ul><li> It also had a unicorn with 4x the hit points of the dragon. This wasn't even in the game proper; it was intended as a GM's "pet", but the mechanics allowed players in certain circumstances to attempt to summon any NPC in the game. Players who thought the dragon wasn't enough of a challenge would have a go at the unicorn. If superbly equipped, it <em>was</em> possible to win this fight, though the odds weren't terribly good. Later GMs learned from this and, if they bothered to create a pet, created one that was either weak enough not to be worth killing for bragging rights, or with hundreds of times as many HP as players and attacks strong enough to <strike>kill</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">obliterate</a> level-capped players with a single hit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld">The Secret World</a></em> features one of these in the Issue #9 mission The Pachinko Model. Here, one of the later goals involves retrieving a randomly-placed key from the third floor of the FNF offices — all while avoiding Sachiko, the ghost of a former FNF member. This is intended as a stealth mission: after retrieving the key, Sachiko bursts in, forcing the player to either hide behind a screen until she leaves or just sneak away... but naturally, some players are tempted to try tackling her in combat. Unfortunately, Sachiko has more hit points and attack power than most of the enemies in Kaidan and this quickly ends in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>; monsters as tough as Sachiko generally require players to team up against them, but The Pachinko Model is a strictly single-player instance - forcing you to play the mission as intended.
<ul><li> Since players engaged and killed her from time to time anyway, developers later buffed her hp and shields into the stratospere, making her way tougher than local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, and buffed her attack power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> levels.

The original mystery was just <em>finding</em> the Goomba, since it spawns at the bottom of the level, meaning that the Goomba's activation range is out of the range of the spawner's activation range (meaning that it's impossible for Mario to activate the Goomba and kill it, since it despawns if you leave the spawner's range, and the Goomba disappears after the one frame it's alive because Mario isn't in the range to activate the Goomba). But <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEBMaAoKRvw">after it was discovered<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the problem quite naturally turned from "where's the Goomba?" to "how exactly do we kill the Goomba?" He made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdXyDLsemz8">another video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of him trying out multiple methods to kill the Goomba, though none of them worked. The search for a way to kill it continues, however, and one day a method might be discovered.
</li><li> A staple enemy in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> series is Shotzo, a little cannon that shoots cannonballs at Kirby. Normally, Shotzos are invulnerable, and must be avoided, or dropped into a pit. However, Shotzos sometimes come in from the sky, floating down with Parasols, which are far from invulnerable (destroyed on contact with anything faintly Kirby-related). Normally, if Kirby sucks up the Parasol, it'll simply come off; however, the Throw ability found in some of the games will pick up both the Parasol and the Shotzo, and when said Shotzo hits a wall, it pops like any other enemy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy">Rogue Legacy</a></em>, traps that are immune to damage from your weapons (bouncing spike balls, spring-loaded floor spikes, and wall-mounted fireball shooters) can be killed using Retribution runes (which return a percentage of damage taken to the enemy that causes it).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II</a></em> the waters around Haven City are patrolled by a sentry bot which will kill the player with one shot if they move too far out. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Dark Jak</a> can destroy it with a dark bomb, although it may still get a shot off. It won't respawn, but you can only move so far before you fall off the world.
</li><li> In the Roguelike/Platformer hybrid <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky">Spelunky</a></em>, the Ghost is a recurring "enemy" who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell">serves as more of a deterrence</a>, to discourage dawdling on a level to get all of the treasure. If it touches you, you instantly die. It isn't killable at all in the original freeware version of the game, but in the multi-platform HD version, it has 9,999 HP, and it <em>can</em> be harmed for what amounts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> if it comes into contact with lava or a UFO's plasma shot. One player, Bananasaurus Rex, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt6mDAQ8tFU">successfully killed the Ghost by chipping away at its health<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but since it's not intended to be killable, it has no death animation, and it just disappeared once its health reached zero.
</li><li> Normally, there are only a couple of ways to kill NPCs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em>, set by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">level's creator</a>. If you use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Overlord Glitch</a>, however, you can drop explosives on anything and everything in the level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em>: At one point in Launch Base Zone, Robotnik flies by to pick up a box. You can hit him a couple times, but then he'll fly away with the box, to be fought again later in the level. However, in a Sonic and Tails game, if Sonic stays below a certain point, Robotnik will never fly away, allowing Tails to keep hitting him. After 256 strikes, he pops and leaves a small animal behind like any regular badnik does when defeated, but he'll still be around for the boss battle later in the zone.
</li><li> The last stage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em> features a side-scrolling segment with Kamek, who is invulnerable to attacks and vanishes whenever Yoshi comes close to him, making him unkillable by any normal means. However, Kamek's attack transforms blocks into enemies, and it is possible (though very difficult) to make him transform the block that he is <em>standing on,</em> making him fall down. If there is a bottomless pit beneath him, then this will successfully kill him during the side-scrolling portion.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man (Classic)</a></em> games, the penultimate boss is typically the Wily Machine, which is piloted by the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Dr. Wily. After defeating the boss, he typically ejects from it via escape pod, which is normally invulnerable to Mega Man's weaponry. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em> however, there's one weapon (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rain Flush</span>) that will kill him as he's escaping, causing him to poof in a small explosion similar to a typical enemy. However, doing this will then prevent the stage from properly finishing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">leaving you trapped in the room with no other option but to reset the game</a>.

You're supposed to ignore it and just run for the core. It still hasn't stopped people from destroying it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">swarming</a> it with infantry or tanks/Titans. More unconventional tactics involve luring it onto a bridge and then blowing up the bridge beneath it, or getting it to walk over a Firestorm wall section or between two laser fence posts and then activating them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Still another</a> tactic is destroying everything hostile outside the firestorm wall, then launch Hunter-Killer drones until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">one finally targets</a> in on the Defender. The thing bypasses the otherwise impenetrable firestorm system and kills the mech in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one hit</a> just like anything else.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>, it is possible to destroy the undead camp in the final mission, which completely stops the attack until the scripted event begins where Archimonde scales the mountain personally.
<ul><li> Speaking of Archimonde, he's meant to be unkillable, as he's strong enough to massacre almost anything in his way and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Sells</a> everything you can throw at him via Spell Immunity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">Divine armor</a>. However, he still takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> from attacks, so <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/s9opu7egcRQ?t=13m40s">that didn't stop players from killing him anyway<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This leads to a very strange end-of-level cutscene where Archimonde is absent and a couple of buildings spontaneously implode.
</li></ul></li><li> A mission on the main path of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em> involves racing against the Zerg in an attack on a nearby Protoss base to grab an artifact. If you put off that mission and do many of the side missions and research and upgrade your units (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">or build lots of Reapers</a>), it is possible to destroy the Zerg base. Although the AI cheats with regards to the resources and larvae it has to spend, all attacking units it creates outside the drop pods are built normally, and destroying the base makes it impossible for any units (other than the aforementioned drop pods) to be created.
<ul><li> Any mission against the Tal'darim in <em>Wings of Liberty</em> that doesn't involve wiping out their forces as a primary objective can still be completed by wiping out said forces. Matt Horner will indicate that the Tal'darim are in full retreat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">the mission will end successfully</a>. This is most noticeable in the Siege Tank mission, where you have control of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>. As long as you have researched orbital commands, you can scan a part of their base, queue up a couple of buildings, and destroy them one at a time until the mission is over. There's even an achievement in the Feats of Strength section if you take out the Protoss in Welcome To The Jungle (a mission where you're supposed to only send out heavily armed convoys to protect a single SCV collecting gas canisters).
</li><li> The devs seem to have caught on to this, as all expansions have achievements for destroying bases when you're supposed to be focused on more urgent objectives (even as your allies tell you to stop attacking an entrenched and fortified foe when there's other things to worry about).
</li><li> Arguably the defining event of the Starcraft universe is the capture of Sarah Kerrigan by the Zerg. However if you plan ahead, it's quite simple to prevent her from being overrun in the first place, so simple that it might happen by accident. The Zerg simply send all their available units, and once those run out, all you have left is a thin trickle of infinite Zerglings, like someone left the tap on. That Mengsk refuses to rescue her from a threat that's already contained makes him look less like an evil bastard and more like the laziest man ever born. In the same mission, Kerrigan becomes invincible by script when the Zerg invasion starts, in order to avoid her being killed by the aliens. The mission actually forces the player to defend the Zerg from the Protoss invasion force. When the last Protoss building is destroyed, the Zerg invasion is triggered. However, in the fraction of seconds between the destruction of the last Protoss builing and the triggering, it is possible to kill Kerrigan just a moment before she becomes invincible. This is easily one by setting speed to the slowest rate and using battlecruisers with Yamato cannons to attack simultaneously Kerrigan and the last Protoss building. If timing is right, the trigger will happen while Kerrigan dies, thus starting the ending cutscene with the Zerg overrunning everything. Oddly enough, although killed, Kerrigan will still play her quotes during the cutscene, asking for an immediate evacuation.

<ul><li> In most of of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> single-player RPGs, Lord British is not invulnerable — just very, very, <em>very</em> tough, with limited invulnerability to all but certain weapons. In later installments the developers caved to player's persistence in finding ways to kill him, and started adding easter-egg murder methods on purpose.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080315012814/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=181917">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> details all of the ways that Lord British can be killed in the <em>Ultima</em> series.
</li><li> His "death" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em>, where the player can drop a plaque on his head, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">based on a real-life incident</a> where Garriott was injured by a falling metal bar at the Origin offices.
</li><li> In one of the expansions to <em>Ultima VII</em> you can obtain a mythical black sword that can instantly kill almost any creature in the game. Naturally, this includes Lord British. Killing LB with the black sword even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">triggers special dialogue</a>. Strangely, this doesn't include the final boss Batlin, which was lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony:</a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "So I can kill Lord British and make the game unwinnable, but killing the villain (which is logical) I can't-... because."
</div><ul><li> Lord British didn't appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a>: Pagan</em>, but there was Beren, the town sorcerer, who punished any misdeeds the Avatar committed by blowing him up. He couldn't be killed by normal means, but that didn't stop <a class="urllink" href="http://www.it-he.org/u8_beren.htm">some players<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from exploiting the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a> against him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld">Ultima Underworld</a> 2</em>, it is possible, though extremely difficult, to kill NPCs by pushing them into water if there is a body of it available. This can be used to best effect against Dorstag, whom you are supposed to obtain a quest item from through combat or other difficult means. Though most of his plunderable inventory disappears beneath the water with him, the quest item actually stays on the surface for you to pick up. You can kill virtually all NPCs by attacking them too, but drowning them avoids retribution.
<ul><li> Both <em>Underworld</em> games also have the secret spell Armageddon, which kills everyone when it is cast.
</li><li> The exceptions are the inhabitants of Castle British in <em>Underworld 2</em>, including Lord British. They have unlimited health, there isn't any water available, and high-level spells like Armageddon don't work in Britannia because of the blackrock gem encasing the castle.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w59gepTvmc">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> short film, where the Avatar (Played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony</a>) attempts to kill Lord British (played by Garriott himself), only to find that swords, axes and even a grenade launcher do absolutely nothing to him.
</li></ul></li><li> In the German version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> children are supposed to be invincible. This can be annoying if they turned hostile to the players for whatever reason. However, if you polymorph them into squirrels by magical spell or wand, you can kill the squirrels - and watch them polymorph back into dead children.
<ul><li> Very rarely, in the initial build of BG1, Gorion would kill the armored figure during the ambush encounter, causing the game to lock-up and crash (though it required his spells to hit for 85+% of their possible damage each time, and he needed to kill the ogre on his first spell), the Armored Figure's hp was buffed in the following patch.
</li><li> Elminster is very killable, but it's EXTREMELY difficult since he has -30 AC (only a 5% chance of hitting him since only a natural 20 will work), 1800 hp, and will despawn if he can talk to you which he constantly tries to do. An attempt requires boots of speed and the throwing axe +2, and managing to avoid him at his first encounter so you can come back later. It takes about 3 hours of running a circle chucking the returning axe at him. He awards 26000 xp.
</li><li> A slightly more obscure example can be found with the mage Shandalar, who serves as a quest-giver in Ulgoth's Beard in the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. Although not immortal, he is very obviously designed to be as close to unkillable as the game engine allows. He will cast Globe of Invulnerability on himself the moment anything threatens him, and is specially coded to be able to cast spells twice as fast as the player can. His AC is also so high that only a maximum level fighter stands a chance of hitting him. To add insult to injury, he will teleport away after a few rounds of combat, rendering attempts to whittle him down with lucky hits pointless. However, a Scroll of Protection from Magic will render his attacks completely harmless, and an extremely liberal use of magic wands will suffice to kill him before he can teleport away. For your troubles you get the best (neutral aligned) mage robe in the game, which can otherwise only be purchased for an enormous sum of money at one special shop.
</li><li> A good number of characters that are supposed to be unkillable (for example Ulraunt from Candlekeep) rely on one or more of the following: having their HP boosted to absurd amounts (several hundreds in Ulrant's case), making them invulnerable to attacks, and giving you only a very limited time to interact with them. However, a player can delay the event interruption by immobilizing the NPC that is supposed to start it and bypass the invulnerability with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hits</a> (if the invulnerability is combined with boosted HP then this can take hours but is still doable). The creators of the game anticipated that something like that may happen and created a special NPC called Biff the Understudy who automatically appears to say the dead person's lines in their place.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>, at one point you're meant to damage down an enemy to make them surrender. This was implemented by giving that enemy around 1300 HP, and turning on an invulnerability flag as soon as they hit about 1000 HP, making them unkillable by any normal means. Nonetheless, by combining a Harm spell (which sets an enemy's HP to single digits) and a damage-over-time spell like Creeping Doom on the area around that enemy, you can manage to knock that enemy down to 0 HP and death just before the invulnerability flag triggers. Sadly, this makes the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByInsanity">unwinnable</a>, because you needed to speak to them to leave the room that you're in.
</li><li> A more suicidal variation is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>. Normally it's impossible to die in the hunter's dream <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except at the hands of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>,</span> but many players have found ways to do so anyway, such as by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints">Cast From Hitpoints</a> weapons.

Notably, the ring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">blocks all magic</a> used on him except elemental spells, which it will instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">reflect back onto the caster</a>. It also has constant effect Health and Fatigue restoration enchantments, meaning he will heal faster than you can reasonably damage him and will never tire out during the fight. This adds up to him being virtually unkillable. (Emphasis on the "virtually" though, as he can definitely be killed, allowing you to loot his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a> ring.)

He has no death animation, though, so when he dies, he just melts into a weird lump of Dagon-colored goop. Similarly, you can hit him with an exploitative custom spell or a game-breakingly powerful weapon to achieve the same effect. In either case, "killing" him does nothing to change the game's ending.

<ul><li> While there are no HP To 0 mechanics in this game like there were with <em>Oblivion</em>'s lava, the Wabbajack's effect of transforming whatever it hits into random things sometimes circumvents the Essential flag, meaning that under the right circumstances, one can turn Jarl Balgruuf into a sweetroll. The community has yet to figure out how to weaponize this without mods, however.
</li><li> In early releases, NPCs could drown even with the Essential flag. Once that was discovered, no one was safe, not even the children. This was eventually patched out not long after discovery.

Unfortunately for the people of Bowerstone, the game is only nerfing <em>your</em> damage, and if you can bring in and subsequently protect a mercenary or two, you can murder your way across town all you like!
<ul><li> In addition, you can always pick a fight with the guards and navigate the town in a way that gets the townsfolk killed by friendly fire.
</li><li> And also, one of the simplest mods to make for Fable is one that lets you keep your weapons in Bowerstone, with predictable results.

This being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Diablo</a></em>, you can imagine how well that went.
<ul><li> Not only that, but players figured out ways to kill monsters that are immune to all elements, monsters that cannot even be <em>targeted</em> (tip: damage reflection) and even monsters that cannot be targeted <em>and</em> are immune to all damage <em>and</em> do not have any attack that would trigger damage reflection. There are even four different ways to do so: resurrect monsters with "burn" damage which bypasses resistances and attacks hit points directly; find the item that summons instakill reanimates on your side when you kill enemies; find the item that summons a certain boss whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">death animation is coded to autokill nearby monsters</a> on your side and let it "expire"; or use a bugged passive in combination with Open Wounds to cause the monster to take physical damage despite being immune to it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Torneko: The Last Hope</em>: there are priests in Toro Ruins, and they are treated like monsters, except you can't attack them directly. But you can shoot arrows, magic thunders, or even turn them into items. When this occurs, though, a message appears and says: "Divine retribution!" and a giant lightning bolt drops your HP to 1. Oddly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">recorded on your adventure log</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> had a rumour/legend that the <a class="urllink" href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Hermit">Hermit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> NPC was killable, via some sort of trickery. As a browser-based not-so-multiplayer role-playing game, he had no stats and no way to be encountered as an enemy. He's said to 'drop' most non-obtainable (or even nonexistent) items in the game. As of July 2015, he can be fought, but he has not been (nor should be) killed.
<ul><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> is the Naughty Sorceress, who is supposed to be killable only with a certain item in the inventory. Two players, Cobain Dougans and DarthDud, managed to beat her without the special item and were rewarded with custom Golden Sausage and Silver Sausage items. The description on the Golden Sausage reads, 'Congratulations on your surprising victory, and darn you for forcing us to come up with a way to keep that from ever happening again.'
</li><li> Cobain Dougans has also managed to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWormThatWalks">Guy Made of Bees</a>, who is also supposed to be unkillable without the use of a certain (different) inventory item.
</li><li> The Sorceress has been beaten a third time by MimiRiceCat. No Bronze Sausage yet, but the Sorceress has been upgraded <em>again.</em> It is now no longer even theoretically possible to kill her without the necessary item—you instantly win if you have it, and instantly lose if you don't.
</li><li> It should be noted that while the others had to get crafty about it, Cobain was one of the highest leveled players in the game, and accomplished this through <em>SHEER FORCE.</em> In a game where the average player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">ascends</a> by level 15, and there are trophies for those that get to 30, and most clan-quest people hover around 40, he was 116 at the time. Note that leveling up requires you to get a specific base stat (which one depends on your class) up to (current level^2)+ 4, and to get the <em>n</em>th point in a stat requires <em>n</em>^2 total EXP in that stat. <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/fivepoints/form%20three/ns208.jpg">Cobain Dougans' screen shot shows<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> that he had a base Mysticality stat of 13354, buffed up to 48476. This means he had over <strong>178.3 million</strong> EXP in his Mysticality stat, when the only enemies at the time with a base yield of more than 40 EXP were for seasonal special events. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> indeed.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=202251">It happened again<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even though you instantly lose if you don't have the item you need, a glitch in a newly implemented item gave a player a chance to act, upon which they made use of a different newly implemented item to reset her stats to manageable levels. This would serve as a testament to the ongoing creativity of players, except that it apparently managed to happen entirely by accident this time.
</li><li> A fight against "The Whole Kingdom" (involving literally fighting the entire map at once, encountered in an area where you've been made gigantic) was intended to be unbeatable. It has 1 million hit points, and takes only 1 point of damage from all attacks. Furthermore, the battle automatically ends in 10 rounds (so you can't just do one damage a round for a million rounds). Of course, <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=209935">someone has finally defeated it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the last level, you will meet the <a class="urllink" href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Riders">Riders<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, three immortal beings who, when killed, will always rise from the dead again. There are only two known ways to dispose of them permanently: kill them, and fill the level entirely with monsters so they have nowhere to reappear, or turn them into green slime. Neither is considered a bug (in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">there's a special message for the former</a>), although most players consider them much more of a hassle than simply finishing the game.
<ul><li> It's also possible to level-drain two of the three until they become weak enough to enslave with Charm Monster — <em>now</em> you're playing with power!
</li><li> In earlier versions, it was possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">tin Death</a>, removing him from the game permanently. Eating the contents of the tin was instantly fatal.
</li></ul></li><li> Some players like to take this to the next level, and kill entire <em>species</em>. This is generally easy for most monsters, as almost any monster that is created 120 times is considered extinct and will never be generated again. <em>Unique</em> monsters can also be made extinct because the game has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfRules">Loads and Loads of Rules</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>.

Extinctionists take their job seriously.
</li><li> The Mail Daemon is a creature that delivers messages from other players watching you online. It appears and disappears within the span of one turn and, therefore, can't normally be interacted with at all, much less killed. So, naturally, sufficiently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> players have found a way to kill it. To do this, the player needs to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wish for a statue of a mail daemon, cast stone-to-flesh on it and to kill the resulting daemon in one turn before it disappears with a cry of "I'm late!"</span> No more mail will be delivered for the remainder of the play session.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> game has Brahms, Lord of Vampires. You are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">not supposed to beat him</a>. If you do through luck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, or cheating, the game just deposits you back into the Overworld without ever mentioning it again, and the game pretends that you had chosen the "don't fight him" option. He appears again in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, but by that time you are expected to be strong enough to match him.
</li><li> In the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, <em>Final Fantasy II</em>, Kain is intended to be invincible when Cecil fights him over a crystal after Kain's under the influence of Golbez's mind control. However, though Kain has 60,000 HP, a ridiculous number of health points for an enemy so early in the game, one can use a combination of level grinding Cecil to 40+ as well as unequipping all of his armor except for his shield to make Kain's "jump" attack miss virtually every time, allowing one to slowly drain Kain's HP and heal Cecil before Kain can inflict enough damage to win. Of course, though Kain turns purple and fades away, as if a normal enemy has been defeated, the scene immediately afterward goes on as if Cecil had lost the fight, not acknowledging anything the player accomplished in battle.
</li><li> In the original NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, you have what is supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> against Bahamut early in the game. He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">65535</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> (an absurd number for that game), and fully heals every single round, but it is still possible to kill him. If you do, not only do you get no reward, but you get <em>punished</em> — it becomes impossible to get him as a summon later in the game.
<ul><li> PC damage is capped at 9999, and the party limit is 4. At that point, it's <em>quite impossible</em> to deal more than 39996 damage in a round, then he full-heals. (In reality, that 39996 is more akin to, say, 400.)
</li></ul></li><li> Gogo the Mimic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>, and you're supposed to 'beat' him by copying what he's doing at the moment, or to put it in another way, since he's just standing there, not attacking, you're meant to do the same until he congratulates you for understanding the true essence of mimicry and declaring you the victor. But if you do decide to try to beat him the old-fashioned way, he has ridiculous stats, counters every hit with a 9999 damage counter and every spell with Flare, Holy or Meteor, and will yell at you and Triplecast Meteor if you get him below a certain HP level. There's also a short timer on the fight, and you die if you don't beat him before that. There are multiple ways of beating him - some involve using Reflect on all characters to get Gogo to attack himself; others involve using Mute to keep him from casting his spells.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, you have the Guardian, which is supposed to be invincible and act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol">Border Patrol</a>, blocking entry into Vector at a couple points in the game. It can be defeated due to the Echo Screen/Joker Doom glitch (which allows you to instantly win any battle.) As expected with this trope, the game acts as if you lose. The glitch was fixed in the GBA port.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> Fan Mod "FFT 1.3" contains a rare battle that was intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>: not only does he have a slew of incredibly deadly abilities (including one that instantly <em>crystallizes</em> a character to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>), he can't be damaged by conventional means...except the battle arena contains a trap that does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to him when he steps on it. When an extremely patient player managed to kill this encounter via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>, the mod-maker promptly patched the game so that even this exploit no longer worked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a>,</em>
<ul><li> Giygas is supposed to be killable through one means and one means only: Paula's "Pray" command. While he does have a "real" HP value, calculational trickery otherwise keeps him alive. However, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Compilation Re-release</a>, using a Viper on Giygas can poison him... and the poison will eventually kill him. On the other hand, since the battle wasn't ended the scripted way, glitchery ensues and you end up in a world preconfigured for the game's ending... an ending which won't happen now.
</li><li> Master Belch is immune to damage of any kind until you use the Fly Honey on him. However, the Hungry HP-Sucker doesn't <em>count</em> as damage, because it's a draining effect. It's possible to kill him the long way by exploiting his vulnerability to status effects and drawing his hit points out the long way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, the only way to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Pig King Statue is supposed to be with either a lucky shot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">PK Flash</a>, or use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">New Year's Eve Bomb</a>. He has <em>100 million HP</em> otherwise, and regularly hits you for more HP than you probably have. It's just not possible to beat him conventionally without cheat codes, if only because, at the end of the day, long after you've run out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">PP</a> and healing items, he still has <em>99,000,000 HP left to go</em>. It's a numbers game and his are just far, <em>far</em>, <strong>far</strong> superior to yours. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNvzRrTthA">That hasn't stopped people from trying, though.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Problem is, for the people strong enough to go the distance, it turns out he has another dirty trick: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgi2jHPSihc">freezing the game.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> He hadn't even worn down all 99,999,999 HP — according to a comment, it was somewhere around 2 million.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Ultimate Chimera</a> avoids this thanks to the fact that the game doesn't even give the player the opportunity to fight it. If he catches you, it's an instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> has Charon, the guide who takes you to the Moon Palace, who is actually just a common enemy called a Robin Foot locked into a position where he cannot attack the player. He can't be hit with weapons, but magic can kill or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">transform</a> poor Charon. Additionally, the final boss is <em>supposed</em> to only be damaged under very specific circumstances (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having the hero hold the Mana Sword and having both of his sidekicks cast Mana Magic on him</span>), but his defenses are not impenetrable to normal weapons when charged to sufficient levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> has another example of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> are everywhere across the castle - Running the hospital, the shops, even the portal that takes you to the storyline maps. Now, you can't attack them in the castle.... or can you? (Here's a hint: You can.) All you have to do is call an assembly. If one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> shows up, you can happily beat the tar out of them. Then when you get back to the castle, you'll find a little gravestone where they were. Wait a minute.... you just killed the demon running the Hospital... how are you supposed to heal? Just save, reset, and they'll be back in their spots again.
<ul><li> The series also features a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fights</a> that you must lose to advance the plot (Etna and Laharl in Disgaea 2, for instance). These enemies are never truly invincible, just <em>way</em> more powerful than your party is expected to be. This being Disgaea, you <em>can</em> stop and level grind for ages until you are capable of winning. Typically results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a>. Since seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">all the different endings</a> is a frequent goal of players, plenty of people actually do this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, at one point in the main story you face off against Zetta's nemesis Alexander, who is level 1000, which you'll have no chance to beat if you''re only leveled appropriately for the previous fights. However, Salome joins at level 1200 as a neutral party and almost certainly kicks his ass.

<ul><li> Desaix, the boss of Chapter 1. There are actually 2 bosses on his map, and he's nigh invulnerable and not really intended to be defeated, not only having a third tier class and massive stats, but also a shield that raises his defense and resistance through the roof and heals him every turn.

However, with the introduction of easy mode in a patch, most of them became <em>technically</em> possible to kill, even though the process was long, difficult, and involved a share of luck. Enthusiasts posted a detailed guide to killing <em>every single creature outside of towns</em>, except two dragons that are too tough to kill even this way and a frog in the tutorial, which only survives because the player has no ranged weapons at this point. This slaughter, nicknamed "Project Genocide", completely breaks the game scripts, making quests play in the wrong order, NPCs making references to future events, and corpses and empty spaces participating in conversations.

Your spellcaster even stands on her own, in a unit of only herself. Should you advance the plot, or wait three months, a real army of 900 will come to bring your shenanigans to a crashing end.

The player is supposed to enlist the help of Hawkeye Gough to shoot Kalameet with a greatarrow and knock him out of the sky, then he can be fought. However, it is possible to exploit blind spots in Kalameet's attacks and pelt him with arrows from the ground yourself to kill him without Gough's help, though it is extremely time-consuming.

You're obviously not supposed to be able to kill any of the four, as they're level eight and you're level one or two at this point. However, clever players have found a way to kill three of the four (Dallis can't be killed with this method for plot reasons). On the ship you start out on, quickly grab a deathfog crate or barrel from the bow room before the Kraken destroys all of them, then drop it on top of Alexandar when you reach him. As deathfog is an instant kill on the living regardless of level or stats, this will kill him and Dallis' pets, though, as noted, will leave Dallis alive.

If you do choose to fight him, though, it seems impossible as almost all of his stats are maxed out, he has 500,000 HP and 5000 MP, all of his attacks are one-hit kills if they connect, and as soon as he's damaged he casts regen, which causes him to regain 62,500 HP per turn (which is far more than your party could conceivably dish out in a turn).

The message for the area explicitly tells the player (paraphrased) "This is the Captain of the Guard. He cannot be killed. No matter how many players you bring, you will not kill him". Naturally, many see this as a challenge.

The developer didn't think anyone would be able to do it and the game assumes the normal events happened where the boss wins and continues from there.

This army never leaves the town, and the game specifically warns you that you don't have to and shouldn't attack it. However, it is possible to destroy it, by prudent use of Dark magic (specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Berserk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice">Puppet Master</a> spells).
<ul><li> The supposedly unassailable Inferno fort presents in the last mission of Haven campaign. The growth of creatures in this fort greatly exceeds that of player: for example, player can buy 2 Archangels in a week, while in this fort several Archdevils appear EVERYDAY. But this fort can be taken through a loophole in game mechanics: on each creature's week several of the named creatures spawns of the map and through Diplomacy you can take them in your army. While the growth in the fort is astounding, it is arithmetical. On the other hand, the growth of creatures on the map is geometrical (and higher the difficulty, faster the growth), so it is possible to build an army which can take the fort. Unfortunately (or fortunately considering the following events), it is impossible to proceed on the plot once you've done that.
</li></ul></li><li> Cap'n Hector from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a></em> games was an NPC who would remind players to register (pay for) the shareware game. After the 30 day trial period ended, the Cap'n would start warping in to attack your starship every chance she got, usually resulting in a very quick death. However, while Hector was invincible to conventional attack, it was possible to kill or disable her with splash damage in the original game.
<ul><li> Similarly, all the developers appear as customized ships in EV Nova that have a small chance of appearing in any system. Two of them are invincible, with no weapon being capable of damaging them. However, the death explosion of ships dealt damage that was not prevented by their invulnerability. For most ships, this damage was minuscule and the explosion was tiny. However, the massive Leviathan freighters exploded across half the screen for high damage and could be used to kill these two NPCs.

<ul><li> An otherwise unkillable character (at least, at that point in the game) is intended to be escaped; throwing him in the water neutralizes him just as easily.

With some clever tactics, decent equipment and/or lots of grinding, anything can be defeated, and doing so may even net you special rewards in the form of rare gear, named characters and special cutscenes or endings. Be aware that defeating some enemies you were <em>supposed</em> to lose to may result in Bad Endings.

Naturally it's supposed to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableTrainingSimulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableTrainingSimulation">Unwinnable Training Simulation</a> but some players managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb">pull a Kirk</a>, to discover that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">mod had no idea what to do with it</a>.

The Clothier drops his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">red hat</a> when you take him out, and the Guide can be directly killed if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you equip the Guide Voodoo Doll and attack him, or if you dunk the Voodoo Doll in the lava in the Netherworld</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrueltyIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrueltyIsTheOnlyOption">You HAVE to kill him by the latter method to spawn a certain boss that must be beaten to progress to Hard Mode</a>.

<ul><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingFace">Dungeon Guardian</a> NPC, meant to protect the Dungeon from earlier acess than intended, had 9999 hp, 9999 defense and 9999 damage, aside from being very fast. Yet, many players were able to kill it, using fast shooting weapons (that would deal 1 damage per hit) and reversing gravity in order to be fast enough not to be hit. Thanks to how defense works, and the addition of armor dealing melee damage done to the player back to the attacker, as well as an item allowing a small dodge chance, this was in a few updates relatively easy, until it was patched by decreasing the guardian's attack to 1000. However, another later patch introduced a flying mount with exactly the same movement speed as the Dungeon Guardian, once again trivializing it by letting you just fly away from it across the entire world while peppering the Guardian with bullets or arrows. The developers have since acknowledged the ability to kill the Dungeon Guardian by making it drop a unique pet.
</li><li> Skeletron Prime has been killed after sunrise, although it's more boring than anything since he only takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> and instakills you if he touches you. He doesn't drop anything special, as opposed to the Dungeon Guardian.

So, naturally, players <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLscXyIP4c8">found<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOffJQHZSM">physics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTg3vB8x3TY">glitches<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that allowed them to <em>destroy planets</em>.
</li><li> Danger Ranger, the obnoxious jet-engine on skis that pesters you incessantly in <em>Slamscape</em> can be killed with the crushers found in Repsychler or Viva Los Vangrantes.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Freespace</a></em> series, there are some missions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">you are supposed to fail</a>, and some ships that are supposed to survive and escape to fight another day. Naturally, some players attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreak">Sequence Break</a> the game by killing these ships. There is an "Invulnerability" flag for each ship that can be triggered by a mission designer to prevent this, but many mission creators consider using it to be cheap and sloppy. Thus leading to this trope when they try to engineer a situation in which it seems logically impossible to defeat an enemy, yet some player manages it anyway and breaks the mission.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> included a fight with psychic Psycho Mantis, who would dodge all your attacks because he could read your mind. In order to hit him, you were supposed to shut down his mind reading ability by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">plugging your controller into controller port 2</a>, but there are brief moments where you can make a hit connect even without doing this, letting you (slowly) win the fight with the controller still in port 1. Combining the FAMAS with the Bandanna and just utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">saturating</a> the boss room in a spray of never-ending bullets will wear him down relatively quickly, his mind-reading be damned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, every block in the game is destructible except for bedrock, which forms the indestructible bottom limit of the game world. But just because it's supposed to be indestructible and there's no good reason to want it destroyed (no, you can't build hanging constructions below the bottom of the world - the game makes building there outright impossible, with any placed blocks vanishing instantly), <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1swlfzXzo">people have figured out how to destroy it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BNbDI8a2I">despite the developer's continuing attempts to prevent the exploits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is most often used to get above the "indestructible" ceiling of the Nether, where you <em>can</em> place blocks; this makes building portal networks and certain types of farms much easier, since it provides a perfectly flat empty space without all that pesky lava.

However, a player called BigBug beat it, demonstrating that it was possible if one was incredibly skilled, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">insanely persistent</a>, and very, very lucky. Since then, 26 others have gone on to beat it and post their runs online. Scott has acknowledged this by programming in a reward: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">A third star on your loading screen</a>.
<ul><li> It happened again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateCustomNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimateCustomNight">Ultimate Custom Night</a></em> and its <strong>50</strong>/20 mode, which Scott confidently claimed to be unbeatable. He was proven wrong within 2 weeks of the game's launch. The first person to manage it was Rhemery, who took nearly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">12 hours</a></em> to make it to 6 AM.

However, if you create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OilSlick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OilSlick">Oil Slick</a> at the top of some stairs and get her to trip, it's entirely possible that she'll break her neck and remain stuck on the ground, unable to do anything except blink and fruitlessly turn invisible, which makes the stage a cakewalk. Similarly, if you place the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OilSlick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OilSlick">Oil Slick</a> on the docks and get her to run over it, there's a chance she'll slip into the water, which renders her just as impotent.

This was removed in later patches, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a> Galactic Adventures</em>, you can make buildings indestructible if you want them to function solely as set dressing; in that case, the building's name, life bar and alignment won't show up when you hover your mouse over it.

</li><li> The 4x/grand strategy game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> has three endgame crises. These are designed to be tough to defeat, but possible, and in fact most players with some experience can beat them on their standard settings. However, some players have taken it to the extreme, causing them to spawn at maximum strength as early into the game as possible, resulting in them spending in excess of a century fighting them but ultimately succeeding. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then there's the End of the Cycle, which is only available to psionic empires. It provides you with enormous benefits for 50 years, the price being at the end of those 50 years your entire empire is destroyed and you take over a single planet, with the only things you inherit being the technologies you researched and your traditions. Every other empire gets a major opinion malus, and the single most powerful "ship" in the entire game appears on top of your old capital. So of course, people have proceeded to come back from this and conquer the galaxy.</span>

</li><li> Scott's method from the same novel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a>: he exploited a simulator mechanic that was based on a theory that worked numerically, but was refuted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

In this version he has the Klingons drop their shields so he can kill them easily, and then acts like a smug jerk about it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> revealed that now cadets are <em>encouraged</em> to find solutions like these.
</li><li> One of the "New Frontier" novels revealed that Captain Calhoun's solution was more similar to this trope than the others- instead of trying to rescue the <em>Kobiyashi Maru</em>, he blew it up and ran like hell, reasoning that either a) a trap, as it was just too convenient that the Birds of prey <em>just happened</em> to show up when they were essentially three steps into the Neutral Zone, or b) even if they weren't it wasn't possible to rescue them, and he was sparing them from being sent to prison camps.
</li><li> An early episode of Voyager had Tuvok criticize his trainees for this; in his version of the scenario there was literally no reason not to simply retreat, but they tried to fight it out anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> has Agents, entities the Machines use within the Matrix to hunt down runners and rebels. They possess the bodies of normal humans, making them impossible to kill permanently (as they'll just leave the dead body and possess a new one). Even killing them temporarily is all but impossible, as they're very good at dodging bullets. But, at the end of the first movie, when Neo embraces his identity as the cyber-messiah, he actually does kill Agent Smith by directly screwing with Smith's code. In the sequels, Agent Smith actually returns from death—rather than submitting to deletion, Smith transforms himself into a computer virus. By the end of the third movie, he's infected every program and human in the Matrix. This makes Smith both impervious to deletion attempts from Machines outside the Matrix, and able to defeat Neo within the Matrix. Smith is finally killed for good when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Smith possesses Neo, which makes him vulnerable to a kill-code the Machines inject via Neo's body.</span>

In its most notorious scenario, a giant offers the player two cups and the player has to choose the one that doesn't contain poison. The catch is that the game is rigged — no matter which cup the player chooses, it'll end up being the poisoned one. After obsessively playing through the scenario numerous times, Ender opts to gruesomely kill the giant, being the first cadet in Battle School to do so.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8yhch');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8yhch" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8yhch');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was published in 1985, so the author can be forgiven for thinking that sociopathic massacre of NPCs in open world games was a daringly out-of-the-box stratagem rather than the default mode of play.</span>

<ul><li> An old adage in tabletop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>, and similar to this trope, is "If you stat it, they will kill it." This is probably a take-off of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">Predator</a></em> quote, "If it bleeds, we can kill it."
<ul><li> This may be why various RPGs avoid statting certain characters. For instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> gives only a few ballpark skills for Dr. Methusala, but only as a last resort. GMs are encouraged to treat him as an event, rather than a character.
</li><li> Similarly, the tongue-in-cheek First Law of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkinism</a>: "Any finite number can be reduced to zero."
</li><li> In one of the books, White Wolf has an encounter with Caine, the first vampire in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a>. His given stats are two words, "you lose".
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG provides stats for many of the series' stronger characters, although they would be tremendously difficult to overcome, and usually come with a note saying that they are "heavyweight class supernaturals". There's two exceptions: Mother Summer and Mother Winter. Their stat blocks read: "Aspects: Mother Summer - and that's all you need to know."
<ul><li> This is not quite borne out by the game, though. The way FATE runs, any character with a skill level of 6 or higher <em>literally cannot</em> fail an action governed by that skill for any reason other than GM fiat, and most heavyweight supernaturals have skills in the double-digits. Their power level is literally referred to as "plot device", and the stat blocks are more intended to their power relative to each other rather than the players.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>
<ul><li> The Original Edition <em>Gods, Demigods &amp; Heroes</em> and the 1st Edition <em>Deities &amp; Demigods Cyclopedia</em> gave the gods stats. This led a lot of players to treat them just like really tough monsters and try to kill them. Later editions generally avoided statting the gods themselves, and if they needed to make a personal appearance, would send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">an avatar</a> with a fraction of their powers (but still really tough).
</li><li> The 3rd ed book <em>Deities and Demigods</em> contained almost exclusively stats and info on most gods in the game, including the Faerûnian pantheon and the Greek, Norse and Egyptian pantheons. A majority of them are grossly underpowered and badly built, ripe for having player parties kill them and steal their divine powers.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> entity known as the Lady of Pain has no stats for this very reason. As the inscrutable ruler of Sigil who can flay an opponent with her <em>shadow</em> and keeps major gods at bay, she's not supposed to be taken down by a bunch of munchkins. The fans wouldn't have it any other way, to the degree that when the 3rd edition Planar Handbook statted her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> and nothing else it was met with disapproval.
</li><li> Writers for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> setting split the difference with Gwydion, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>: they wrote up stats for his <em>tentacles</em>, but never give the heroes a chance to confront his actual, unstatted body.
</li><li> The Tarrasque is designed to be the most powerful monster in the world - it's huge, it's strong, it regenerates any damage quickly, and it can't be permanently killed outside of a <em>wish</em> spell when it is at a negative hit point total. However, it can't fly, has no ranged attacks, and possesses no magic, making it easy pickings for any decent mid-to-high level group or monsters like dragons (which are, generally speaking, the most powerful monsters in the game due to their spellcasting abilities, ranged attacks, and ability to fly).
<ul><li> The Tarrasque's claimed status as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> has led players, combined with the relative ease of victory, to come up with creative ways to fight it. One <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?261519-D-amp-Dish-The-city-built-around-the-tarrasque">thread<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on rpg.net described how the rules make it entirely possible to have a city capture the Tarrasque and use it as a neverending supply of food, since it'll always regrow what it loses. Then again, since the only comprable thing to it would be SCP-682 mentioned below, which isn't very good eating, one has to question the quality of the food...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> clarified that their Tarrasque was unkillable, period, even with wishes and instant death spells. It will always regen the damage eventually. Of course, making it someone else's problem is not out of the question. Even then, it's still killable. Its immortality is listed as an ability in its stat block, so with the right spell<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9uh80');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9uh80" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9uh80');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Baleful Shadow Transmutation</span>, it's entirely possible to remove it, rendering the beast mortal.
</li><li> Each edition of <em>D&amp;D</em> buffs the Tarrasque to defeat the previous edition's cheese strats. By now it is flat out immune to ability drain and damage (which used to permanently incapacitate it) and throws 6 spines from its tail to stop people from cheesing it with ranged attacks. Fourth Edition even gave it a very wide aura effect that inflicted <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcrophobicBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcrophobicBirds">Acrophobic Birds</a> on anything that tried to fly in its area, preventing them from getting above chomping distance.
</li></ul></li><li> In contrast, all major characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a> are quite killable, by design. The Lord of Blades, a major character in the setting, is only level 12. Vol, a being worshipped as a deity by thousands, is only level 16 with some templates. Of course, a level 12 3.5 character is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">ridiculously strong</a> by any reasonable standard; even the non-spellcasting classes at such levels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">far beyond what a real human could achieve</a>. The creators have also suggested that these are just their stats <em>now</em>, and they're still active and growing stronger over the course of any given campaign.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Faerûn</a>'s major players are also mostly statted out. Though they're generally higher-level than Eberron's, they're not designed very well, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">hastily converted from their AD&amp;D stats</a>. Evil adventuring parties tend to treat Faerûn like a big theme park full of low-hanging branches of XP.
</li><li> Achaekek the Mantis God has an ability which stops any mortal dealing him lethal damage... but it doesn't work in an anti-magic field.
</li><li> One of the vestiges the Binder class can augment themselves with is Chupoclops, a lampshade of (and possible posterchild for) this trope. Clearly inspired by the long history of the Postulate in action among D&amp;D players, this particular spirit is the shade of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">unkillable creature from beyond space and time</a> destined to be the harbinger of the apocalypse. Until a band of heros broke into the spirit world the gods had trapped it in and killed it. (by unspecified means probably involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">multiple rings of three wishes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">an epic level wizard/rogue/ranger/cleric/monk half-dragon pixie</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements">a bowl of lemon custard</a>.) The universe had no clue how to handle this turn of events and so Chupoclop's spirit was sent to the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteVoidRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteVoidRoom">planar waiting room</a> as the rest of the vestiges and its corpse remains ignored where it died, for all eternity or until someone figures out what to do with it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> module "Valley of Dust and Fire" explicitly brings this trope up. The Dragon of Tyr is utterly beyond any mortal adventuring party's weight class, and killing it would totally wreck the setting. Yet there's a fair chance your party will be crazy/stupid enough to try it, just because the thing has stats. The module notes that while it's entirely up to DM to decide whether to allow the Dragon to die, they're on their own if they do.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryGygax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryGygax">Gary Gygax</a> himself was actually <em>very</em> reluctant to give stats to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Angels</a> expressly because of this trope. He was all too aware of this mentality, and as a devout Christian, the idea of players butchering the literal servants of God for XP probably strayed a little too close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a> territory for him. As is, most types of Angel <em>do</em> have stats, but generally speaking, your party is unlikely to be going around killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">heavenly spirits</a> unless youre running a really unusual campaign.
</li><li> The Dungeons and Dragons adventure <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> included Artus Cimber, a friendly if distant NPC who owns a powerful magical artifact ring, which has him constantly hunted by giants seeking to reclaim it. He isn't evil and doesn't oppose the players. But still, in the Adventurer's League notes for Tomb of Annihilation, Wizards had to add a warning that any PC group who killed Artus and stole the ring would be banned from ongoing League play.

<ul><li> The crew at Pinnacle would recite the adage about statting things in the first edition of the books. They would refuse to stat certain characters in order to railroad people into sticking with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot">metaplot</a>. Seems to have been reversed in the Reloaded release, though.
</li><li> The character Stone has no stats for this exact reason. In <em>Deadlands Reloaded</em>, he has stats, and it's possible (though very difficult) for a powerful posse with the right abilities to incapacitate him for long enough to make an escape, but he takes no actual damage from anything other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a gun he fires himself, or the bullets that killed him the first time</span>. Neither of which is going to happen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>
<ul><li> The module "Harlequin" refuses to stat the title elf, and explicitly calls this out as the reason. (Great Dragons, meanwhile, avoid the Postulate not by not having stats, but by having a mechanic in their stats that allows them to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount">The Battle Didn't Count</a>, to appear dead but actually survive, and then destroy the PC party via manipulation from a place of complete safety.)
</li><li> Harlequin finally got statted in <em>Steet Legends</em>, which is full of stats of famous Runners. If you though Harlequin was tough, Gwynpaine is much worse. And unless you perform massive overkill, Harlequin will appear later and state he had a nap and may let you off seeing how you amused him.
</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> developers used to recount an incident when a fan described how his party had set off a briefcase nuke the moment they met Harlequin, thereby sacrificing themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">kill the unkillable</a>. Their GM had let it work because "there was no way even Harlequin would be walking around with a custom anti-nuke protection spell." The developer responded that he would have ruled that knowing humanity the way he did and being the kind of guy he was, Harlequin would have dropped everything to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">create an anti-nuke protection spell about 10 min after the first test in 1945 and would not have let it lapse since then</a>.
</li><li> As of the fifth edition, all dragons now have Edge and great dragons no longer have stats in the rulebook. There are guidelines for making them, however, but given how fierce a regular dragon is, the concept of fighting one, let alone getting away with it, is a pipe dream for most runners.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Unknown Armies</em>, it's stated that it's impossible to effectively fight or even oppose an Ascended Archetype unless you have another one on your side. However, the most powerful Archetype of all, the Comte De Saint-Germain, <em>does</em> have stats - in three versions. In one of these he's ridiculously powerful, but in another he's a baffled regular guy and could be potentially killed. Of course, since his role as Archetype of Karmic Reincarnation is to install the rules of Ascension in every newly created universe, killing him could have very complicated consequences..
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>: The third edition of the book made sure to give all vampires of third generation and below at least one Plot Device power to keep the players from just killing them willy nilly. Which is amusingly inverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Time of Judgement</a>, which has a couple of scenarios that go out of their way to give players ways to kill (or help kill) 3rd generation vampires (and Caine!) willy nilly. That said, the official stats for Caine are the two words: <em>"You lose."</em>
</li><li> The older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MiddleEarthRolePlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MiddleEarthRolePlaying">Middle-earth Role Playing </a></em> gave statistics for Sauron in the <em>Necromancer of Dol Guldur</em> supplement. He's immensely powerful at 240th level (for comparison, Nazgul are 20th level in the original book or 40th in the supplements and Gandalf et al are 60th level), but since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MiddleEarthRolePlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MiddleEarthRolePlaying">Middle-earth Role Playing </a></em> has open ended rolls and instant-death criticals, even the lowliest hero could get lucky and kill him with a lucky combination of 96-100 attack rolls and a decent critical hit, assuming they could get into combat with him in the first place.
</li><li> Deep 7 Games, a small RPG company specializing in quick, "beer and pretzels" role playing (you can roll up characters, learn the setting, and play a story in a single afternoon) gives impossible to beat characters with all stats reading <em>"Yes"</em> and/or flavor text in the description that they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> anyone stupid enough to try.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pendragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pendragon">Pendragon</a></em>
<ul><li> Pendragon's combat system works on a basic d20 to hit. You have a skill, roll under it and you hit and between you and your opponent, the highest hit wins. Roll your skill exactly and you critical; A critical is better than a hit so it's possible to defeat someone of higher skill in a pass of arms with a critical even if their skill is higher and they roll a higher hit. When your skill reaches 21 you critical on both 20 and 1; 22 is 20, 1, and 2. Lancelot has a 40 skill with all weapons; he always hits and he always crits. Yet it is possible to beat him in a pass at arms and even in an entire fight (as happens once in the entire Morte d'Arthur). If you always crit higher than Lancelot's crit, you can damage him through his usually-amazing armor, his usually-present protection from God, and his slightly-superhuman hit points until he falls. Galahad is another story. Under Galahad, it reads, "Galahad wins."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>
<ul><li> Great Cthulhu has a stat block. <em>Good luck</em>. The first of the combat abilities of Cthulhu reads: "Each round 1D3 investigators<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10hdm9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10hdm9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10hdm9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Early editions had Cthulhu eating 1d4 PLAYERS a round.</span> are scooped up in Cthulhu's flabby claws to die hideously". Through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>, or perhaps from an earlier edition, this often gets quoted as "Cthulhu devours 1d6 investigators per round" or the like. Just <em>seeing</em> Cthulhu forces a character to lose 1d100 SAN (sanity) and the maximum SAN is 100, so do the math. If somehow you manage to kill Cthulhu, he just reforms a few minutes later, fully recovered. Nuke him and he comes back radioactive.
</li><li> In fact, almost every Great Old One and Outer God in this game has stat blocks, and almost all of them can take up to 1d20 or <em>1d100 Sanity</em> just <em>looking at them</em>. The most triumphant example is likely Nyarlathotep - if you kill him while he's masquerading as a human, he simply becomes a horrible monster (causing your poor Investigator to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Go Mad from the Revelation</a> in the process) and flies off into space. If you kill him as a monster, that particular form of him dies and he is banished, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow">it's only a small part of him you actually managed to defeat in the first place</a>, and it <em>will</em> come back to haunt you later...
</li><li> And, of course, this didn't stop an annoyed player from screwing with his GM and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OldManHenderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OldManHenderson">managing to kill Hastur via lots of explosives.</a> (This was due to house rules that effectively give the Great Old Ones "summoning sickness" when manifesting, resulting in an extremely short window of time where they can be permanently killed. Since the GM had established this rule previously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">he had to abide by it</a> or admit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a> the campaign.)

The exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimordialChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimordialChaos">Azathoth</a>. While other bosses have unique, nasty attacks, Azathoth's attack description is simply this: "The end is here! Azathoth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroys the world</a>." Furthermore, on the off chance that players could overcome the -∞ penalty to attacks against him and defeat him before he destroys the world, he has the additional special ability that the players lose the game when he awakens.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> were made to defeat impossible and unkillable threats. Even top gods and rulers of all Creation has not only stats, but notes for GM, how the world will be changed after their death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> being <em>Rifts</em>, when it added "Pantheons of the Megaverse", the first thing many players tried to do was take on Odin, Ra, Marduk, or whoever was handy. But the book also described beings far more powerful with lines as succinct as "tick them off and it's time to roll up new characters." No stats or names were provided, but presumably the writers were referring to capital-G God and distinguishing Him from those wannabes on Olympus. (It also suggested that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Masters</a> didn't include Him in the campaign, since constant divine intervention makes the game kind of boring.)
<ul><li> Full character stats for such in-universe celebrities as Erin Tarn and Emperor Prosek are presumably included in the game just so players can take a stab at offing them; named characters <em>without</em> stats are actually a minority.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em> has one of its most infamous villains, Captain Reis, on the cover. He has stats. He's also nearly impossible to hit... with a sword. However, he doesn't wear armor and you can't block bullets. Shoot him and throw in all your drama dice and you can put a hole in his skull.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">It is impossible to kill anything with Unkillable 2 or 3.</a> However, even if the GM gives an NPC one of these traits, player can still attempt to do any number of other nasty things to it, like mind controlling it or chopping off its arms, which kind of exemplifies this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSIlluminatiUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSIlluminatiUniversity">GURPS Illuminati University</a></em> provides the ArchDean. She's the one in charge, and the stat block for her, such as it is, says that she has <em>fnord</em> points, and it only gives rough approximations for her known advantages (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">levels of Resources that make intergalactic empires weep in jealousy</a>) and disadvantages (she's known to have some levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>, and she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover">very protective of cats</a>). The book makes it perfectly clear that she can't be killed, might only be reasoned with if the player is lucky and/or smart, and that attracting her attention (even in a positive fashion) is not a smart idea even if you're a literal god.

<ul><li> In older editions, Celestine the living saint had an ability which means that she can never be killed — rather, if you do, she would get back up. Players found multiple ways to kill her permanently using specific rules phrasing. In 7th edition, Celestine can be revived only once per game. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11u2xj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11u2xj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11u2xj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The means players came up with included using Old Zogwort, vortex weapons, Sweeping Advance, Shokk Attack Gun or Deep Striking mishaps. Most of those rules specifically say that the affected model cannot survive by any means. </span>
</li></ul></li><li> Dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em> which are closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> have such insanely high stats and powers that most parties wouldn't last a turn in a fight. However they still can be defeated (but not killed, only another dragon can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">kill one off for real</a>.)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's explicitly stated that the Leviathan, ruler of the deepest level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">The Underworld</a>, can't be killed or even stopped in any meaningful sense — the stats provided are solely for escaping it, or hurting (more like "annoying") it enough to drive it away temporarily.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent">Spirits</a> or similar entities of Rank 6 or higher have no stats at all and are so much more powerful than playable characters that it is essentially impossible to harm them. Zig-zagged with the <em>Imperial Mysteries</em> sourcebook, which does provide guidelines for statting out entities of cosmic power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> notes that there is no significant way that any creature of this world can hope to damage an Arch-<em>Qashmal</em>. If it can even be bothered to retaliate, it can wipe out the players with a thought. The book that says this <em>does</em>, however, add that intrepid players can destroy it indirectly; all <em>qashmallim</em> are created to fulfill a specific goal, so if they can render its goal impossible, the Arch-<em>Qashmal</em> will cease to exist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">The God-Machine</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">Demon: The Descent</a></em> is not a single entity and more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">exosystem</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em>, the most powerful characters are considered to be "PLX", meaning that their power level is as high as they want it to be. Most of them don't even have stats, just a block reading "PLX", with the assumption being that they can do basically anything. Due to lacking combat stats, they can't be defeated except by plot mechanics. However, a few have a statblock where one or more of their power rankings is listed as "X" (meaning, again, it's as high as they want it to be), and these guys can be defeated — though it's still very, very difficult, especially if the "X" is listed under "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower">Variable.</a>"

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Webcomics </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KidRadd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KidRadd">Kid Radd</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructionCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructionCrossover">Deconstruction Crossover</a> of video game tropes, so this comes up a few times:
<ul><li> The final boss of the game <em>Mofo</em> was supposed to be only vulnerable to a special ability none of the characters had. It turns out that he just has a lot of hit points and regenerates them each turn, which allows the team to defeat him. In an in-universe nod to the Postulate, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">unlocks a tongue-in-cheek ending to the game</a> where they are chided for "cheating".
</li><li> Said game was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Lawyer-Friendly Cameo</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, and as discussed above, Giygas has similar protection.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>:
<ul><li> The leader of criminal gang The Felt is named Lord English, after a particular spin put on a cue ball in pool. Creator Andrew Hussie hadn't even <em>heard</em> about Lord British until later and, when he was informed about similarity between the names, decided to make the Lord British Postulate apply to Lord English, mentioning in a character's narration that he can only be killed by exploiting "numerous bugs and glitches in spacetime." This particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> surprisingly fits very well within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>-related powers that the rest of The Felt possess.
</li><li> Eridan's NPCs in the Land of Wrath and Angels were supposed to be unkillable, but Eridan believes they were enemies — despite, as Karkat observes, the fact that they don't drop loot like actual enemies — and somehow manages to kill them all through sheer determination. Sheer determination and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">about a minute apiece of sustained fire from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ahab's Crosshairs.</a> Unfortunately, after too much of this, they become hostile and actually begin attacking him; how he manages to fight off and eventually kill the entire species is a mystery not explored by the comic.
</li><li> This is Vriska's attitude towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Bec Noir</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> created when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Becquerel</a> prototyped himself, inadvertently giving the Kids version of Jack Noir (who had already gone insane) a massive power boost</span>. Specifically she wants to be the one to personally kill him (despite how ungodly powerful he is) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">"win" the game</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naturally it turns out that she <em>massively</em> underestimated his abilities and Terezi is forced to kill Vriska to keep her from leading Bec Noir to their hiding spot (which, in an alternate timeline, caused the deaths of all the Trolls).</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Web Original </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the oldest canons of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a> is the long-running and often-disastrous attempt to kill <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682">SCP-682<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an immortal hostile entity. These attempts have extended to the use of some of the most dangerous SCPs in containment. So far, only few stories manage to kill it. Notable are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/revised-entry">one that has 173 (the original SCP) multiply<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, other is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/kill-682">drunk driving<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Additionally, their guidelines on how to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warpers</a> involves a bit of this. They might be able to erase you from existence itself with a thought, but they're still limited by human intelligence - the trick is to come up with ways of killing them that they won't see coming, mostly involving sniping them through the head from over a mile away.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CounterMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CounterMonkey">Counter Monkey</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony</a>, who has also described the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> in his Ultima Retrospective videos.
<ul><li> In "All Jedi or No Jedi", he mentions having put a cameo of Darth Vader into a Star Wars roleplaying campaign just to add a bit of flavour, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">it to instantly derail</a> as his players become obsessed with trying to kill Vader. Spoony refuses to let them and tries to nudge them into realizing it without stating it, but they still pursue Vader and end up being killed when he escapes and they're surrounded by enemies. Spoony says this taught him a valuable lesson about never including canon characters in roleplays of existing franchises like <em>Star Wars</em>, because the GM's players are going to go after them every time.
</li><li> In "Because He's There" and "If You Stat It, They Will Kill It" he criticizes the use of the D20 system for games involving entities like Cthulhu, because if the designers give something stats, inevitably the party will try to kill them. Even though they are such <em>strong</em> stats that it is almost impossible to actually defeat Cthulhu, and knowing he will just regenerate even if they somehow do, players will <em>still</em> always try because of this trope.
</li><li> "Thou Shalt Not Fuck with the Lady of Pain" details a <em>Planescape</em> campaign where a player tried to pull a fast one on the Lady by using a mis-remembered racial ability of the Minotaur to easily escape her Maze spell. Spoony's response: make the "maze" a 100 million mile-long hallway that'll take a million years to escape, even with that ability.
</li><li> Spoony spoofed this with the original Lord British himself, Richard Gariott! As his "Avatar" self, he tries to attack Lord British, who doesn't even notice he's being attacked.
</li><li> In the "Thieves World" story, his players accidentally made enemies with an immortal champion of the setting's god of war who was supposed to be their benefactor. They have to spend the rest of the campaign hiding from him until they find a way to get rid of him as he is simply too powerful for them to have any hope of beating him. They ultimately succeed in killing him with the help of the man's also extremely powerful sister. He eventually will come back, but probably not until they are dead of old age. (Spoony also admitted he somewhat fudged this fight and it probably wouldn't have worked as written in the stats, but they'd worked <em>so hard</em> for it by this point that his GM fiat allowed it.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NationStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NationStates">NationStates</a></em> is a political simulator played largely by answering political issues. That it has <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=307728">a combat system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>at all</em> is an example of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheRaggedEdges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheRaggedEdges">Boone Quest</a></em> featured an odd inversion. The character of Nel Torokvei was created to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLamb">Sacrificial Lamb</a> who was infected with a deadly parasite and would have to suffer either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> early on. She was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">chronically depressed and nigh-useless</a> and most interactions with her involved her on the verge of breakdown. However, the playerbase found a chamber meant to heal badly-injured party members, and decided to use it on her instead. She ended up being cured, and surviving to the end.
</li><li> In the same vein as Boone Quest above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RubyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RubyQuest">Ruby Quest</a></em> has Stitches and Jay. The players were able to avoid killing Stitches when he attacked them because they'd earlier bashed their way into a medicine cabinet (which they were only supposed to get the key for after killing Stitches) that contained tranquilizer. Jay was supposed to suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>, but the players asked to free him, and Weaver couldn't think of any reason <em>not</em> to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This saves Tom later on, as Stitches makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save him from having to fight Ace to give Ruby and Jay the opportunity to get out.</span>
