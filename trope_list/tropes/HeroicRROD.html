The red ring generally doesn't appear until it's too late to do anything about it, at which point it's usually time for a new console. Originally there were 4 red ring codes in total, three red lights being the classic RROD and indicating the dreaded hardware failure (stemming from a bad soldering job on the motherboard). One red light indicates another kind of hardware failure, and two red lights mean the console is overheating. Four red lights (the only actual *ring*) is known as the Fake-out Red Ring and appears when the console is turned on without plugging the AV cables into the TV. But that just confused people and led to a lot of unnecessary returns, so in later models, the red ring always means something has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>.</span> See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating">Overheating</a>, the underlying idea behind this.

</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a>:</em> Given that the mostly normal main characters are fighting against high-caliber demons, they battle to exhaustion almost every time. There's a specific example in the manga, where Rosette decides to release Chrono's seal, which eats away at her life force, <em>and</em> fight her brother at the same time. The stress of it is so great that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her soul disconnects from her body and she dies. She gets better, though.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>
<ul><li> In general, overusage of chakra has this effect. As chakra is essentially life-force, using too much can dip the user's reserves below the minimum that their body needs to function correctly, causing heavy exhaustion and even internal damage; Tsunade is actually rendered comatose after expending nearly all her chakra to shield the village's populace from Pain's city-flattening gravity attack. Kakashi explicitly states (at least in the English dub) that if you use up absolutely <em>all</em> of your chakra, you drop dead. It's theorized that Kimimaro and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi</span> both died not from injuries, but as a result of draining their chakra to absolute zero. This is pretty rare, though, and both of them were already dying to begin with.
</li><li> The Chakra Gates have this trope as the consequence of pushing the body beyond its limits. How much the body can actually take depends on the user, but opening all eight gates will absolutely bring death. Happened otherwise in the animé series fillers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Might Guy opened all eight to fight Madara, he began <em>disintegrating alive</em>. Naruto saved him, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> shows that it's confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</span> For bonus points, opening the third gate actually turns the user's skin dark red due to increased blood flow. If a user opens the eighth gate, they're surrounded by a glowing red mist created by their <em>blood boiling in their veins</em> and their body actually cooks itself into charcoal due to the heat.
</li><li> At higher stages of the tailed beast forms, the user's skin is flayed off by the strength of the chakra, but at the same time is healed fast enough that they aren't killed. Those that have befriended their inner demons can become the full beast without issue, though the lesser forms still present the skin problem.
</li><li> Chouji's special food pills convert calories into chakra at an alarming rate. Chouji's girth is the only reason it isn't instantly fatal, and it would have been anyway if not for proper treatment.
</li><li> Naruto developed the Wind Release/Wind Style: Rasenshuriken, an upgrade to the Rasengan that is vastly more powerful, but does cellular damage to his hand. Tsunade forbids him from using it, but eventually he fixes the problem by throwing it after he gained enough control of its form, so that only his enemy is hit.
</li><li> Kakashi is made of this trope. At one point other characters are actually shocked when Kakashi doesn't have to go to the hospital after a fight. For example, extended use of his Sharingan drains tremendous amounts of his own energy. Any time he reveals it, he's effectively racing against the clock to finish the fight before his collapse.

</li><li> The main cast isn't immune to this. After the villainous example mentioned above, Kenshin himself collapses and his friends have to carry him away. Due to his lack of muscle, Kenshin's body goes through serious stress when using Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu. The repeated overuse throughout the series inflicts hell upon him, and by the end of the series he is completely incapable of fighting at his old level. In a sense it is a concept of "the straw that broke the camel's back". Kenshin's style mastery was incomplete so he fought mostly with what he had. He usually showed no sign of slowing down before. However, once he learned the ultimate technique, a necessity for him to have any chance against Shishio, it all snowballed since it put a lot more strain on his body than any other technique.
</li><li> Sanosuke's hands get broken whenever he uses Futae no Kiwami after the Kyoto arc.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> series has several powerful techniques that can befall the heroes in one way or another, even overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:
<ul><li> Tien/Tenshinhan's Tri-Beam/Kikoho attack, a ki attack far exceeding the power the Kamehameha, which is supposed to kill the user if used too long; nevertheless, Tien is able to master it so that it can be used repeatedly. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, given the exponential power rise of the opposition, it quickly becomes Tien's first-choice technique, and using it, he's even capable of pinning Semi-Perfect Cell down for a while before getting incapacitated from using repeatedly.
</li><li> Goku's power-multiplying Kaioken technique, which is also supposed to be crippling if the multiplier is set too high. After learning x2, however, Goku takes it up to x3 and even x4 for short bursts in his battle with Vegeta when the x2 doesn't work. The power boost seems to give him an edge, but this trope taking effect means that using them was actually doing more harm to himself than Vegeta to point where Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">actually had him on the ropes without knowing it</a>. At the climax of his pre-Super Saiyan power, he is able to practically sustain x2 and has mastered the use of levels up to x20 by activating it only in precisely timed pulses just before landing a blow or dodging an enemy attack without any ill-effects. However, it is rapidly rendered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a> by the advent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> transformation, and it may be that using it in tandem with the transformation would result in severe enough damage to make it impractical - the last time it's seen, and the only time it's used in tandem with Super Saiyan, is in the anime filler Otherworld Tournament mini-arc where Goku no longer has a physical body. Turns out the energy limitations make it so if he tried using both for more than a few seconds, he'd have completely used up his energy reserves and disappeared. Something even the Dragon Balls can't fix.
</li><li> The Super Saiyan 3 transformation. It is only attained by Goku harnessing the unlimited energy supply of the Otherworld, and he can never sustain it for very long in the physical world because of its massive energy consumption. This is a major factor in his fight against Kid Buu, where he can match Buu's power but can't maintain it for long - eventually being rendered unable to power up due to the strain, losing all his remaining energy, and downgrading into a heavily weakened normal state. As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> the form has been deemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, with Goku only using it to show off and Vegeta considering the form not worth his time or effort.
</li><li> In the Buu Saga, Vegeta realizes that Majin Buu can regenerate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> and therefore the only way to kill him for good is to atomize him all at once. After saying his goodbyes, he unleashes all his ki energy in an explosion that's visible from space; when the smoke clears his body has seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned to stone</a>. Sadly, some of Buu's body still managed to survive the explosion, rendering this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a>:</em>
<ul><li> During <em>Super's</em> adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, Gohan pushes himself to this point to serve as a beacon for Goku to Instant Transmission to. Why it's this trope is because Gohan had stopped training and his strength plummeted, combined with his brutal beating at the hands of Frieza. Frieza even points out that Gohan's body is tearing itself apart just to do this.
</li><li> <em>Super</em> revisits the Kaioken, explaining that the real reason Goku never combined the technique with his Super Saiyan forms is that the Kaioken requires a lot of focus to use properly, something that's impossible with the battle-lust inherent to Super Saiyan. However, the Super Saiyan Blue form is all about focus and ki control, which lets Goku work out a way to combine the two; even so, it only has about a 10% chance of working properly and is far more likely to kill him. While it lasts long enough for his purposes, after the tournament Goku discovers that the "Blue Kaioken" caused him to develop Delayed Onset Ki Syndrome, a temporary condition that prevents him from making proper use of his ki abilities like flight, teleportation, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">controlling his strength</a>. King Kai, who explains all this to Goku, warns him to only use the Blue Kaioken in extremely dire situations because if he strains himself that badly again, he might end up with a permanent case of Delayed Onset Ki Syndrome that would end his fighting career for good.
</li><li> Vegeta achieves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">a more powerful version</a> of Super Saiyan Blue, and uses it to duel God Of Destruction Candidate Toppo in an epic energy fight with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Final Explosion</a> technique. He survives this time around, but pushing his limits leaves Vegeta with next to no energy left. Leading to a losing struggle in his <em>base form</em> against Jiren.
</li><li> The first two times Goku uses Ultra Instinct in the Tournament of Power, it's an incomplete version that leaves him briefly worn out afterwards. The third time, he actually masters it... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the side-effects are even <em>worse</em>. We're shown a (symbolic?) image of blood shooting out of his back, followed by uncontrolled bolts of black and purple lightning.</span>

While firing two is survivable (though not recommended), a third shot is likely to kill the shooter as much as it is the target. Naturally, Gene fires all of them in the final battle and survives.

Second Gear shortens his lifespan and Third Gear causes a small period of recovery by turning Luffy into an adorable helium-voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">pint-size version</a> of himself. Fourth Gear just straight up exhausts him to the point he'll flop to the ground completely unable to move for about ten minutes and, even if it doesn't do that, it disables his ability to use haki for that period of time.
</li><li> Emporio Ivankov's Tension Hormones, which energize and relieve pain for a period of time at the cost of suffering all of it later. Consecutive usages of it are also very dangerous.
</li><li> The Energy Steroid pills grant immense power at the cost of the lifespan of the one who consumes them. Hody Jones pops them like they were candy, but he and his New Fishmen Pirates plan to kill all of the World Government kings, including their own, and die right afterwards, so it doesn't matter to them. When they're stopped and the drugs' aftereffects kick in, Hody and his men are all turned into frail old men.
</li><li> Sanji has a minor version where the strength of his blows can be too much for his body to withstand, at one point breaking his ribs from kicking someone. However, it takes a lot to get to this point.
</li><li> Chopper's Rumble Ball:
<ul><li> The Rumble Ball enables Chopper to expand the powers of his Devil Fruit by affording him four additional transformation points. The problem is that its effects only last for three minutes, and he can't have more than one in six hours. If he takes two, he loses control, and if he takes three that's when this trope really takes effect. Three Rumble Balls within six hours causes his Devil Fruit powers to go crazy, changing him into a very big and very powerful monster. He also loses consciousness, resulting in a berserker that is a danger not only to foes, but to friends and himself. The form requires massive amounts of energy to maintain to the point that it threatens to kill him if it's used for too long. After he changes back to normal, he's incapable of moving for a couple of hours.
</li><li> Played straighter after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>: eating a Rumble Ball enables him to access the aforementioned transformation, christened Monster Point, for three minutes. As soon as those three minutes are up, he changes back to normal and is rendered immobile for a short period.
</li></ul></li><li> Trafalgar Law's Op-Op Fruit powers are a rarity among Devil Fruits as they automatically drain his stamina just by basic use. He tries to avoid this trope by resting and not using his powers before a major confrontation, but it doesn't always work out. According to Donquixote Doflamingo, it's possible for the user of the Op-Op Fruit to give another person immortality, but doing so costs the user their life.

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>, Major Kusanagi tries to pry the hatch of a very heavy-duty tank open. She pushes her superhuman cyborg body to the limit...at which point her limbs shatter. In the second movie, a sex doll possessed by Kusanagi does the same to its arm when she yanks out a heavy computer device from a wall; as it's not really her body, the scene is played for a small laugh and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the original that it is with her simply moving on to the next part of what she's doing. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Stand Alone Complex</a>,</em> the second episode contains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to this with Kusanagi again jumping onto a huge tank and trying to pull the hatch open, with similar cinematography. This time, however, she simply can't do it, and pulling as hard as she can is just a non-event.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo">Mobile Suit Gundam MS Igloo</a></em>, the Zudah is a powerful Zeon Mobile Suit that was originally considered as their mainline mech, however, Zeon ultimately went with the Zaku design instead. The reason being that while the Zudah is more powerful, it had the killer flaw of the suit's engines creating vibrations. If pushed too hard, the suit will literally shake itself apart.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a> Endless Waltz</em>, in order to breach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s fortified bunker, Heero repeatedly fires his buster rifle at it. However, the Gundam sustained a good deal of damage over the course of an earlier battle, so the recoil of each shot begins breaking chunks off of it until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">third and final shot</a> causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">catastrophic failure</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trans AM</a> system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> gives a huge boost to a Gundam's power output, multiplying its combat prowess several times over. However, it's only designed for limited usage (measurable in <em>minutes</em>), and will leave the Gundam and its pilot defenseless when it runs out, or if it's used up too quickly. Essentially, true GN Drives produce nigh-infinite power. In normal operation, the GN Drive can fill the condensers as fast or faster than their power is used up, making the human pilot the only limiting factor on a Gundam's endurance. Trans-Am simply runs out the GN Condensers (think capacitors), thus making all systems pull directly from the main power source as well as recharging the condensers. In the GN Tau Drives (which can merely use GN particles but cannot generate them), there is a limited amount of fuel and thus once they run out, it's over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, removing the safety limiters on a Gundam's Alaya-Vijnana System results in this: while it grants the pilot total mental control over the Gundam Frame, allowing them to move and react faster than any human being should be able to, it also causes severe neurological damage that is only reversed while the pilot is connected to the Gundam. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first time Mikazuki does this, his right arm becomes paralyzed and his right eye is blinded.

He thus figures out how to turn this strategy against Marik, summoning Revival Jam from the Graveyard in an infinite loop, forcing his foe to draw cards again and again. While Osiris eventually climbs to an unheard of Attack Score of 28,000, his puppet loses via deck-out when he has no more to draw.

Tai decided that Agumon needed a huge amount of energy, so he forced him to eat a huge amount of food, leaving him overfull and sluggish. When Etemon set a brainwashed Greymon on them, Agumon was the only one able to fight it, at least partially because the other Digimon had to give up their food for Agumon, and Tai kept pushing him to fight in spite of his disadvantage and the other kids pleading with him to call Augumon back. The kicker comes when Tai deliberately puts himself in danger in order to <em>force</em> Greymon to Digivolve, and he does so into Skull Greymon, an undead Digimon.

<ul><li> Happens to Usagi twice in the manga: the first time was at the end of the Dark Kingdom arc when she gathers all the power she had to defeat Metallia, causing her broach to shatter and Usagi herself to fall over stone dead. The second time was in the fight with Chaos in the Galaxy Cauldron: she channels the power of hundreds, if not thousands, of Sailor Crystals within the Cauldron through her body to dissolve Chaos into the Cauldron, hopefully not to be reborn from a long long time. This act causes Usagi's body to totally disintegrate.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, this is a regular threat of using the full power of the Silver Crystal (though the Canadian dub cut any and all references to this). Queen Serenity died using the power of the Crystal to banish the Dark Kingdom and send her dead subjects to Earth to be reborn - at the cost of her own life, as she was <em>not</em> reborn with them. The first series ends with Sailor Moon doing the same thing and dying as well (though she and the others end up reborn anyway with no memories of the events that took place in the preceding year). The end of the <em>Sailor Moon R</em> anime has Chibi-Usa and Usagi using all of their power to save the Earth and nearly expiring together (and at one point, they meet in spiritual form and believe they have actually died from overuse of their powers.) The <em>Sailor Moon R</em> movie's big climax is Sailor Moon using the crystal's power to destroy the Xenian Flowers all over the meteor that would spread them to Earth. Despite her friends telling her she could die and their pooling their own power to try and prevent this consequence, the crystal shatters and Usagi dies to save the Earth. A remorseful Fiore gives up his own life force in the form of a flower to revive her.

</li><li> Yusuke's fight with Suzaku winds up draining all his spiritual energy, leading him to use his life energy instead. He manages to kill Suzaku, but the act of doing so nearly kills himself as well.
</li><li> Kuwabara likewise implies utilizing this trope when fighting the final Team Masho member. Despite having several broken bones and barely being able to stand up (due to getting badly beaten in the last tournament round), Kuwabara notes that he'd be able to pull off one final attack against his opponent by drawing from his own life energy. This would surely kill him, but would also incapacitate his opponent Risho, giving Kuwabara's team the win. Fortunately, Yukina appears on the scene and Kuwabara (having a huge crush on her) suddenly gets an enormous self-esteem and power boost in an attempt to impress her. This leads to him taking out Risho handily without sacrificing himself, ultimately averting the trope.
</li><li> Kurama:
<ul><li> Kurama goes through one notably nasty case during the Dark Tournament when he attempts to take out as many members of Team Masho as possible, due to him and Yusuke being the only available fighters at the time. In the first few fights he gets his powers sealed, is badly wounded and suffers a large amount of blood loss, and is forced to infect his own body with his demonic plants to win his next battle. As a result he winds up losing consciousness at the end while still standing perfectly upright, causing the corrupt tournament committee to rule him as still being eligible to fight. Uh oh.
</li><li> Kurama has the ability to put all his remaining energy into one final attack to summon one of his demonic plants, and does so to try and kill Karasu during the Dark Tournament. Thanks to some recent transformations into Yoko Kurama increasing his strength, it makes him able to survive the act.

Early in the story, This severely limits how long Ryuko can fight when she fights with her Kamui, Senketsu, because the blood drain weakens her more the longer the fight goes on.

<ul><li> Many Quirks in have low-level RRODs built into them, running the risk of injury if over- or improperly used. These risks are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">a direct result of the particular power</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a> Uraraka experiences symptoms of vertigo.

Yaoyorozu has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCreation">The Power of Creation</a>, but since she creates objects from her own body fat she can leave herself dangerously underweight if she uses it too much.
</li><li> This is brought up in chapter 38, when Kirishima remarks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">Bakugo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Todoroki</a> seem to have no limits to their Quirks. Bakugo responds that every Quirk has limits since Quirks are just functions of the body. In Bakugo's case, his Quirk uses up his sweat and overuse can damage his arms from the recoil. Todoroki's limitation is that overusing his ice powers can cause frostbite if he doesn't regulate his body temperature with his flame powers. What happens if he overuses his fire isn't elaborated on, but it's implied to be just as bad if he doesn't regulate with his ice powers.
<ul><li> One of the reasons Endeavor, Todoroki's father from which he inherited his flame powers, married someone with an ice Quirk was in the hope the resulting child would have Todoroki's exact same Quirks and thus balance their side effects, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thus not saddling him with his same weakness</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Midoriya probably has it the worst, as his Quirk is too powerful for his own body to withstand, injuring him if he tries to use it. It is so extreme that he ends up permanently disfiguring his hand as well as coming dangerously close to permanently paralyzing his arms before he learns how to use only a fraction of All for One's power instead of running it only at 100%, and to spread this activation throughout his whole body instead of focusing it through one body part. He's since learned other ways to adapt to his quirk's power, such as adapting a fighting style based on kicking instead of punching (as the legs are stronger than the arms) or using tools made for him that help lesson the burden on his body or focus his attacks into more compact forms.
</li><li> Yuga Aoyama has similar issues with his body's compatibility with his Quirk, and even tries to bond with Midoriya over it once he realizes the similarities. In Aoyama's case, he can fire a laser from his navel, but also suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> such that, without a special belt, the laser would constantly leak out of him.

However, he nearly passes out from the strain of using his Force powers in such a bizarre and difficult way — not good, since he's flying an X-wing at the time. Kyp Durron uses the same technique in <em>Rebel Dream</em> to destroy a Corvette and isn't nearly as badly hit, but he is still bone-weary by the time he lands.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">Harry Dresden</a> mentions in one of the early books that overdoing magic could essentially burn out your brain and render you unable to use magic again. Harry being Harry, this happens to him more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>, and many books end with him barely able to stand under his own power.
<ul><li> It's also possible for mages to do this intentionally by drawing on all of their life force, and all the available energy around them, to fuel one <em>really</em> powerful, final spell, specifically referred to as a death curse.
</li><li> After <em>Small Favor</em>, Harry was given access to Soulfire, a heavenly force of creation that he can use to augment his magic. The catch is that it's powered by his actual soul - not in an irrevocable sense, his soul will naturally recover between uses - but if he uses it too much at once, he'll burn his soul out and die. Without a soul. Even the resident Exposition Expert has no idea what will happen to Harry if he dies without a soul.
</li><li> Harry also comes to conclude that the power of the Winter Knight is to essentially allow someone to ignore the usual consequences for acting at their full physical potential, so the Knight won't feel pain as they push themselves past their body's breaking point. This presumably would allow the Winter Queen to dispose of an unruly Knight while they're weakened after a fight.

<ul><li> Andy McGee in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter">Firestarter</a></em> does this, pushing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> power further and further until eventually, he gets a brain aneurysm.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em>, a magical ability that sharpens the senses can also sharpen thoughts. The idea is that increased input shocks a faltering mind into full orientation and awareness. This can be combined with other magical abilities in any number of clever ways, all of which hinge on being able to brutalize oneself and stave off passing out from the strain.
<ul><li> The final <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> novel has a strange inversion, in that a destructive superhuman feat depends on the sudden loss of an ability. A character who's been using the sense-sharpening power the way most people breathe turns it off and runs into a burning building. The narrative goes on about the way "everything is cold, dull, and distant, and blast it, my hands stopped working and I can't work this handle, let's try the elbows..."
</li></ul></li><li> In Brazilian novel <em>A Droga da Obediência</em> (The Obedience Drug), one of the teen test subjects of the eponymous drug dies after doing much work and exercise (the drug doesn't let him feel exhausted, but the body doesn't think that way...).

This comes very close to happening to both Belgarath and Polgara at different points.

Wencit survived only because he's a once-in-a-thousand-years Wild Wizard who's not dependent on his own magical powers.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson</a></em> series, children of the Big Three are more powerful than most so they can use stronger attacks. Percy at one point uses water from his own body to defeat a group of enemies. Afterward, he was very dehydrated and spent a few weeks recovering.
<ul><li> There's another time when he taps into Poseidon's earthquake abilities inside Mt. St. Helens and nearly causes it to erupt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but he begins to break the seal on Typhon</span>. The drain on him is so strong he slips into a coma.
</li><li> Nico Di Angelo, another child of the Big Three, deals with frequent exhaustion because his powers are inherited from Hades and put a huge strain on his mortal body.

</li><li> Apparently, this is a common risk with anyone who bears the Curse of Achilles. You're more powerful and resilient in battle(barring a single weak spot that is a necessity for the curse to work), but it's basically accomplished by cranking your body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>; fight too hard for too long, and you're more likely to drop from exhaustion than a normal human or half-blood.

He gets the job done, and manages to die shortly thereafter from exhaustion, just before a leak in his pressure suit would have killed him anyway.

You can't succumb to your wounds during the fight, but the sword doesn't help you avoid fatal wounds. Once the fight is done, so are you.

It's revealed in the final two episodes that the numerous beatings and injuries he's suffered throughout the show's run (including being blasted, stomped on, run over by a dinosaur-sized and shaped tank) have left him in terrible shape. The show actually ends on the downer note that it's possible he may die of his injuries on his way back home (and one of the OVA series makes a plot point of mentioning his inert body was found floating in space, meaning he didn't even make it out of the solar system. He got better.)

In order to save them, Ayiana uses her healing powers, but each use drains her and leaves her less capable of fighting the disease in her own body. Eventually, she chooses to save the rest of the humans on the station but then succumbs to the plague and dies.

The gauntlets were also designed to protect her bones, and she's been overusing her powers; this means that throughout early Season 4, <em>she's been gradually breaking her arms</em>. Not even her abuse of Rapid Bone-Healing Pills has helped, and by the fourth episode, even a weak shockwave is excruciating, to say nothing of the move resulting in the page quote.

The caster is given <em>tremendous</em> power, nigh-insurmountable defensive abilities, and essentially becomes unstoppable (to varying degrees depending on what level you were when you cast the thing). But after the spell runs its course, the caster crumbles to ash. And while resurrection magic exists in the game, only three <em>very</em> high-level spells can bring back a character who has died in this fashion. Two of them are called <em>Miracle</em> and <em>Wish</em>, to give an idea of the scale.
<ul><li> The proliferation of 3.5 sourcebooks brings quite a few of these. There's the Frenzied Berserker, who is capable of ignoring any amount of negative hit points while raging - but the full effects are applied immediately when the rage ends. The Corrupt and Sanctified spells, which are extremely evil and good respectively, take a toll on the caster; the most powerful ones cost the caster's life, in more or less painful ways - generally "more" for the evil ones. Then there are the Epic spells; creating one is a fairly involved process that includes determining the difficulty for the spell. The difficulty can be lowered significantly by including a "backlash" that hurts the caster.
</li><li> This trope can come into effect at less dramatic levels as well. Rage will inflict an exhaustion penalty on a barbarian after wearing off, which can turn into a huge disability if the fight doesn't end shortly thereafter. The Diehard feat can also be considered this: it allows a character to either stabilize instantly after incapacitation or remain conscious and mobile below 0 HP. True, sometimes all you need is <a class="urllink" href="http://s62.photobucket.com/user/lord_platypus/media/Barbarians-Thetruemastersofthemind.jpg.html">one last round of action to win the day<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but trying to fight with only ten or less HP separating you from semipermanent death (with the DM often declaring additional penalties) is pushing it.

They also come loaded in numbers large enough to afford using them liberally. Unfortunately, any pilot using Inferno rounds has to be extra aware of their heat; Infernos have an unfortunate tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">explode with even less provocation than normal ammo</a> when heated up, which causes both the napalm and the rocket fuel to cook off, instantly overheating the 'Mech and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blowing off a good chunk of its chassis</a>. Jump jets grant extra movement options and agility, but they also allow a 'Mech to pull off the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a> maneuver, dropping anywhere from 20 to 100 tons of bipedal war machine onto another. It's every bit as devastating as it sounds, but the attacker risks incurring a lot of damage to their legs and is almost certainly going to be helpless on the ground afterward, until they can make it back to their feet—and jumping onto an enemy usually means that 'Mech is near the enemy's line. The enemy might be feeling a bit vindictive towards the flying collection of armor and weapons that just landed on one of their own. Finally, triple strength myomers actually gain strength and speed when heated up, ultimately allowing 'Mechs to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage">double damage with physical attacks</a>. That same heat causes the 'Mech's targeting computers to suffer, lowering weapon accuracy, and if the 'Mech overheats too much, the speed bonus is lost entirely.

<ul><li> There are also the Clans' Enhanced Imaging Neural Implants. Getting the implants (which look like brightly colored facial tattoos) means you don't need to wear a neurohelmet to interface with your 'Mech, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Battle Armor</a>, or whatever, but also gain enhanced reaction time with your machine. Of course, the human brain wasn't intended to interface directly with technology, so they burn out your brain in only a few years. Of course, the Clans, especially the Crusaders, are pretty much built on Death or Glory, so they don't really mind.

<ul><li> The Kineticist class uses a resource called "burn" to fuel their abilities. A kineticist can choose to accept burn in order to use more powerful class abilities, and they even get bonuses depending on how many points of burn they've accumulated. The downside to accepting burn is that each point of burn comes with an amount of nonlethal damage that can't be healed until they've rested and lost all of their accumulated burn. While it's not inherently crippling, it does severely reduce how much damage a kineticist can take before they pass out.

</li><li> The latest Eldar Codex has also introduced the psychic power Death Mission, which gives a Farseer significant bonuses at the expense of killing him a turn or so later.

<ul><li> It's also the problem with using too many Sidereal prayer strip Charms, since the majority of them cost a health level to activate and Sidereals are the squishiest kind of Exalt, with the weakest Ox-Body known to man.

</li><li> Spellcasters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> can do themselves serious injury by overusing their powers. Any spell cast requires the mage to roll against Drain. If they fail the roll, they take stun damage equal to the effective level of the spell, which can straight up knock them out if the spell was really powerful. However, if the mage uses a spell with a power level greater than their Magic stat, the Drain roll, if failed, deals physical damage, which can kill. Since the Magic stat only goes up to 6, and spell power can go up to 10...

In combat, it's not uncommon for players to <em>melt off their own arms</em> while trying to kill their target. A critically damaged mech will blow itself up if it overheats for too long. Laser-heavy mechs like the Awesome and the Novacat are prone to exploding from the inside if the pilot is not careful.

What makes it really bittersweet was the fact that he was told by an oracle this would happen. Despite knowing his fate, all that Grayskull cared about was that his kingdom would be free. That just shows how much a guy will lay down for his people.

<ul><li> A (surprisingly common) cause of death in Japan is <em>karōshi</em>, or death by overwork. It's a rather sad example of Japanese working habits. The benign form of this is <em>Inemuri</em>. Obviously, exhaustion from work is so common in Japan that it has become socially acceptable to fall asleep at the workplace. Some people even fake Inemuri to show how committed they are to their work.
</li><li> Some athletes that use "blood doping" (i.e. removing blood, then putting it back in later) to raise their red blood cell count (and thus provide more oxygen to their muscles) have simply keeled over dead because thickening the blood like that greatly increases the risk of clot-related complications such as heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms, and strokes.
</li><li> During the American presidential election of 1800, Aaron Burr nearly worked himself to death due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac">foregoing sleep</a> to have more time for campaign work. By the end of the election his body had started shutting down from exhaustion and various health complications related to chronic extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepDeprivation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</a>. He got better, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesKPolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesKPolk">James K. Polk</a> worked himself into an early grave due to the fact that he didn't like to delegate work to other people.
</li><li> One of the theories behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>'s early death. It took an attempted assassination and three strokes to bring him down. Even after his second and third strokes, he would work <em>continually</em>, despite being unable to talk or feed himself properly.
</li><li> Some say that creative overwork was the death of composer and organ virtuoso Max Reger. He was found in full rigor mortis at the writing desk in his hotel room while on tour, performing; he had been up to the wee hours of the morning writing music and his heart failed around 2 AM.
</li><li> According to legend, when the Persians first invaded Greece, the government of Athens sent Pheidippides to Sparta to ask for reinforcements and he ran all the way, 246 km, only to be told the Spartans couldn't move yet due their sacred ceremonies, then ran all the way back to inform the government of the Spartans' refusal, then, due to the Persians invading faster than expected, he <em>immediately</em> donned his heavy armor and joined the army to march to Marathon, fought in the victorious battle, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringNewsBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringNewsBack">was sent back to Athens to announce the news</a>-and after this final 42 km race, he dropped dead of exhaustion immediately after saying the single word "victory". This happened in 490BC, making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. The place name of Marathon was later used in modern times to refer to a long-distance running race.
</li><li> During the night of April 14-15, 1912, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a> foundered in the North Atlantic. Five hours away was the much smaller (700-passenger) Cunard liner RMS <em>Carpathia</em>, maximum speed 15.5 knots - moreover, <em>Carpathia</em> had not had an engine overhaul in years, meaning that her boilers and reciprocating engines had a much lower maximum pressure and therefore speed (14 knots) because of years of stress. By closing off every governor valve and shutting down hot water and electrical service to most of the ship, every ounce of available steam was diverted to the engines, pushing the slow <em>Carpathia</em> to a speed of 17.5 knots (20.1 miles per hour/32.4 kilometers per hour). Though she didn't arrive before <em>Titanic</em> sank, she shaved an hour off her arrival time on the scene and undoubtedly saved lives (a small number survived the sinking and the dunk in freezing water only to perish aboard <em>Carpathia,</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">Heroic RRoD</a> in itself). The process of so doing severely damaged the boilers (the chief engineer was said to have put his hat over the steam pressure gauge to obscure just <em>how dangerously</em> they were pushing the engines) and the ship never exceeded 12 knots in service again. This may have later contributed to her being chased down and sunk by a German U-boat during World War I.
</li><li> Oddly enough, this is the goal (though not the only goal) for some military branches, especially special forces. Sleep deprivation, inadequate food, extreme physical work... very often, however, the purpose is not to see if you can endure such conditions, but rather to see how you react to them, and whether you give up or keep going despite the exhaustion.
</li><li> It's a common side effect of any physical career, like being a stevedore, or working down t'mill. While, on the one hand, it's true that you gotta use it or lose it, it's also true that the more you use it, the more it breaks down. It's why the age for social security hasn't ever been raised in the US (you still apply at fifty); people are living longer, but they're still breaking down at the same rate.
</li><li> Some dog breeds, such as border collies, have been known to work themselves to death.
</li><li> In some musical circles, it's considered a rite of passage for hand drummers (bongos, congas, and similar) to piss blood at the end of a long night of playing. In fact, they've been playing so long that they've broken down the muscles in their hands from the damage, and they're pissing out proteins that are leaking out of damaged muscle cells. The name for this condition is rhabdomyolysis, and it is common in marathons and other endurance events. Let <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explain.
<ul><li> Word of advice: don't do this if you like having functional kidneys.
</li></ul></li><li> Marathons, Iron Man, and other extreme events have this happening so often (and frustratingly close to the finish line) that it's practically a cliche.
<ul><li> One particularly extreme example involved a woman who, within <em>feet</em> of the finish line (after a race that had lasted for hours), found herself unable to move properly. Despite being in first place by a significant margin, she fell to her hands and knees and started crawling to the finish line. With less than a dozen feet to go, she collapsed. She related later that, despite her attempts to push herself to finish, she distinctly heard a voice in her head say "<strong>STOP</strong>", and when it spoke, she had no choice but to comply. She ended up not finishing the race and almost suffering severe permanent damage to her body as a result<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4361m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4361m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4361m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The next year, she would finish the race without any issues, though not first</span>. She is frequently used as a classic example of a hard impact with hitting the wall, or what happens when the human body hits the absolute limit of endurance.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Cold War-era Eastern Bloc, the term "Udarnik" was coined to describe exemplary, super-productive groups of elite workers who were known and expected to push themselves to the limit in their jobs. They accomplished as much as a work quota of 270 percent of per month and were valued by the state as labor leaders and propaganda tools. Unfortunately, the norm-breaking accomplishment of becoming an Udarnik came at the cost of substandard quality for the goods they produce, lack of work safety regulations and lack of concern for personal health which supports the popular myth that some Udarniks died of deadly exhaustion. Just to show how pointless it was to achieve the title of Udarnik, the western equivalent to that honorary title was "Employee of the Month".
</li><li> An almost literal example happened during the shutdown of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade">Xbox Live</a>. Because the servers couldn't be closed until everyone disconnected, a flurry of players continuously stayed home playing their favorite games online one last time until their consoles crashed from overuse, nearly a full month after the servers were planned to be shut down.
</li><li> Not getting enough sleep, along with a busy, tiring schedule, can lead to complications (such as a nosebleed).
</li><li> Race Horses, similar to human athletes, are at risk of suffering serious injuries due to overexertion. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racehorse_injuries">Breakdown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during a race can be extremely dangerous to both the horse <em>and</em> the jockey, with the possibility of the rider being thrown or crushed under their injured horse. Common injuries include bleeding from the respiratory system (nostrils or lungs), damaged tendons, and even broken bones. In many cases, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> is necessary when a horse receives a severe injury to their leg(s). This has led to criticisms of the sport and accusations of Animal Cruelty by Animal welfare/rights groups.
</li><li> Several Allied fighter planes during World War II were equipped with War Emergency Power (WEP) for particularly desperate situations; WEP was engaged, usually, by pushing the throttle lever past a certain point, which was marked off by a wire stretched across the assembly to stop the pilot from accidentally activating it. It would give the pilot a much-needed boost on the battlefield and improve performance, but would also push the engine past the redline and inflict some fairly major damage to the engine's internals. Mechanics checking the planes after they return to base would always check this wire, and if they found it to be broken, they knew that the engine would need to be pulled out and completely rebuilt.
</li><li> There are at least a few documented cases of people who died from playing games for hours and even DAYS without giving themselves sufficient rest, exercise, or nutrition.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5c3h1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5c3h1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5c3h1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The first documented death linked to a video game, in 1981, was attributed to the player having a pre-existing heart condition.</span> The most noteworthy case was Seungseob Lee, a South Korean man who did a <strong>50-hour</strong> marathon of playing Starcraft and then died of heart failure in 2005. In many of these cases, however, its not so much a case of over-stressing the body, but rather failing to take proper care and subjecting it to conditions it wasn't meant to be in for long periods of time; Long periods of immobility in a sitting position are known to cause blood clots in the legs, especially in the main arteries. When the person finally stands up, the sudden movements cause these clots to break loose and flow up into the brain and heart.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> was recording <em>Innuendo</em>, Freddie Mercury was dying of AIDS. However, during recording for the final track, "The Show Must Go On", he famously surprised Brian May by downing a full measure of vodka, telling him, "I'll fuckin' do it, darling!", and then nailing his vocal track in one take. His condition only got worse from there.
