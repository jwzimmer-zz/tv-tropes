They can defeat hordes of monsters, perform feats of superhuman strength, solve complex puzzles no one else can, answer the most baffling riddles, and is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a> for the action... that is, as long as they are being controlled by the player.
</p><p>Once a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscene</a> starts, or the player otherwise loses even the tiniest bit of control over their character, however, things tend to go south quick.
</p><p>During a cutscene, the hero is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">far more prone to do some rather boneheaded things</a> such as:
</p><ul><li> Taking on too many enemies at once and getting beaten.
</li><li> Declaring there are too many opponents and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSurrender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSurrender">giving up, even if it's obvious</a> that the enemy would be quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">defeatable in a normal battle</a>.
</li><li> Getting ambushed and captured, often by walking into a room or building that screams "ambush", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">especially when the player lobs some grenades inside before walking in</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Getting surprised by someone while trying to climb up a ladder and instantly knocked out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">Mysteriously forgetting the many weapons and abilities</a> they have access to.
</li><li> Letting an ally get hurt or killed.
</li><li> Standing around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">navel gazing</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">the bad guy escapes</a>.
</li><li> Listening to the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a> and exposition without even attempting to attack them, often while the villain prepares for the actual boss fight.
</li><li> Ignoring the use of healing or resurrection abilities and items.
</li><li> Switching from the weapons the player was using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCutsceneInventoryInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCutsceneInventoryInertia">to the default peashooter.</a>
</li></ul><p>Often, such things can only be resolved once the player takes command again. It's as if the main character would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> without the player's wise and guiding hand. This can be particularly jarring when the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink">has been in the conflict for a while</a> and is doing an awful job, but immediately improves once the opening scene is done and the interface pops up.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The best way to gauge how bad the effect of this trope is in a given game is to ponder the question: What would have happened if the player had control throughout the entire game? Because of this, many a player has likely fantasized about how they'd have handily won that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a> if <em>they'd</em> been in charge during the encounter.
</p><p>The rough justification for this comes from a conflict in the nature of gameplay and storytelling. Games generally demand the player to overcome obstacles and enemies to triumph <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">or they will lose</a>. However, effective storytelling often calls for setbacks and precarious situations the savvy player would simply avoid or subvert. Cutscenes are therefore employed so the player's character can suffer plot-enriching setbacks without requiring player failure. It should also be noted that in many cases, especially in more realistic games, what's happening isn't so much cutscene incompetence as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">gameplay power to the max</a>; in gameplay you can often do things like heal from bullet wounds in seconds, and reload and try again if you die, neither of which your character can canonically do.
</p><p>This is especially common in games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">based on an existing story</a>: at some point, the original protagonist screwed up, and their game counterpart invariably has to do the same thing, and the player isn't likely to do that themselves (if only because they know about it). Alternatively, this can result when the protagonist's in-game counterpart was made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass">significantly stronger</a> so as to use more traditional game mechanics—for instance, turning an untrained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivor</a> into a gun-wielding platform-jumping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>—but then jarringly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">shifts back to their original level of competence in cutscenes</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> is the opposite of this. Subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a> for the "interactive" version. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount">The Battle Didn't Count</a> deals with a similar dissonance, where the player <em>does</em> get a chance to fight the battle, but the cutscene has them lose anyway.

They can both fly, have a small window of vulnerability, one of them can attack by means of the player drawing over an enemy with the touch screen, and the other can rapid-fire ice crystals, which can kill even ice-resistant enemies in seconds. However, at the end of their mode, well, you see how they were turned into vampires in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadowMirrorOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadowMirrorOfFate">Castlevania Mirror of Fate</a></em>, Simon gets clocked by a couple of hunchbacks in a brief moment of distraction.

This is despite Link being a fully armed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> at this point and the guards themselves being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">incompetent at best</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, close to the end of the game, Link is getting the final key to get into the Hyrule Castle Tower. Said key is guarded by all of two Lizalfos and two Bulblin Archers. The player could just kill them and be on their merry way, but the game takes over and has Link stand perfectly still so that his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreTeamCannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreTeamCannonFodder">friends</a>" can "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">save</a>" him.
</li><li> Also in <em>Twilight Princess</em>, Link battles King Bulblin in a wooden building outside the Arbiter's Grounds. After winning, Link sheathes his sword and stares silently as King Bulblin collapses, struggles to rise, limps slowly toward the exit door, closes and locks it behind himself, and then sets the building on fire with Link trapped inside. This takes over forty seconds, and only after the fire has spread to consume the entire building does Link take any action.

However, in one cutscene where Ghirahim ambushes him and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">captures Zelda</span>, he is inexplicably crippled by the attack, and is shown struggling and unable to stand or move during Ghirahim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a>.

Link needs to be saved from regular enemies by Impa at the end of the first mission, and both of them need to be saved by Sheik early in the second mission. And then there's Link needing to be saved from shadowy versions of himself in the Temple of Souls, after several missions forced him to slay many of them.

He misses <em>all ten</em> shots at <em>point-blank range.</em> He even fails to hit the Mook that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> attempted to use as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a>.

Through the series, the Prince is forced into levels or boss battles by collapsing floors, unstable masonry, or sucker punches. Here's the thing - the entire concept of the series revolves around the fact that the Prince has the <em>power to rewind time</em>! Thus, each of these inconveniences could be easily avoided, were it not for the fact that they're presented in cutscenes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry">Far Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> takes this to ridiculous lengths. In gameplay, your character is an unstoppable murder machine that routinely wipes out entire mercenary camps without any difficulty. Even without armor, you can shrug off hits from grenades, machetes, rockets, and various types of high-powered rifles, while killing off dozens upon dozens of attackers with little issue - you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros">Brock Samson</a> with guns. But this doesn't stop the game engine from dictating that you be surprised and defeated by a guy armed only with a single machete during a cutscene. Nevermind that the room you're heading into screams "obvious trap" and the player, if they still had control, would probably have lobbed a grenade into the room first. Not to mention as well that you can prove to survive a direct hit from a mortar shell - <em>the</em> single most damaging weapon available to you - then get knocked out by simply being stepped on in a cutscene. Generally speaking, the plot of the game is wildly inconsistent with what actually takes place in the game itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em> continues this tradition. During gameplay you are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo</a>, easily taking out entire camps of bad guys through a combination of stealth and firepower. As soon as a cutscene takes away the player's control, however, the main character becomes a blundering hothead, easily and repeatedly getting knocked out, hurt and captured, not least due to his propensity to rush headlong into danger without thinking. This happens so often that it becomes downright frustrating.
</li><li> Although it's not as frequent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em> as it is in the previous installments, there is one notably embarrassing instance when Ajay, a turbo-charged death-dealer who can single-handedly wipe out entire fortresses full of enemies, first goes to his old family home in Kyrat. Within minutes of arrival, Ajay manages to get himself drugged and captured in a cutscene by Yoshi and Reggie, two petty criminals who are both unarmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5">Far Cry 5</a></em> attempts to subvert this formula having the player get captured or drugged in-game before the story cutscenes kick back in. However, the player quickly realizes that only the illusion of choice is given: if you're at that point in the story, you are going to be hit by the (for instance) insta-capture tranquilizer dart whether you're out in the woods, in the middle of a friendly fortified camp, or flying in a plane hundreds of feet off the ground. This happens <em>nine</em> different times. In the cutscenes themselves you're not so much incompetent as oddly passive: every villain will be allowed to monologue their entire speech/death speech, no exceptions, even when you're in a position of power.

But by that stage of the game, you're so well-armed that three Terminators aren't that much of a problem.
</li><li> Among its other annoyances, the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em>, once you finally steal the eponymous sword, has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> appear in a cutscene and announce that you can't fight him, because it's the same sword in different parts of time, and it would destroy the universe... ignoring that not only does the PC have enough weapons to level a small country, he has two sidekicks with similar amounts of weaponry. "Will someone shoot him, please? He's pissing me off."

That probably <em>was</em> an unwinnable situation in that the system kernel finally got an exact fix on you (meaning all exits are disabled and security programs can infinitely spawn in) and the system doesn't yet have any of the distractions to contend with which make the kernel beatable later.

Both <em>Crysis</em> and <em>Crysis: Warhead</em> have certain cutscenes with situations that are treated as being very dangerous, despite the fact your character could resolve them in all of ten seconds with the abilities and weapons they have available in-game.
</li><li> A couple examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> Towards the middle of the main quest, you find your father being held hostage by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Colonel Autumn</a> and two Enclave troopers. By this point in the game, you're almost certainly a heavily armed and armored murder machine who is easily capable of slaughtering dozens of Enclave troopers. But, instead of simply letting you into the room so you can murderize Autumn and his two goons, your father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">floods the room with radiation, killing the Enclave troopers and knocking Autumn unconscious at the cost of his own life</span>. To top it off, this indirectly results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your death at the very end of the game, when you're forced to walk into the irradiated room to "face your destiny"</span>. Gee, thanks Dad. At least the latter half got got a retcon in the Broken Steel DLC. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">if you send Sarah in there</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">she still dies</a>.
</li><li> And again, after you've been sent to get the GECK. After retrieving it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you get jumped by a squad of Enclave troopers. Keep in mind that you've already fought your way through several dozen of these same troopers earlier in the story. But one flashbang — never mentioned before or after — thrown by soldiers who had no way or reason to get in, and down you go</span>.
</li><li> <em>The Pitt</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> forces you to follow its script by confronting the player character with three typical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em>-wannabe Raiders just inside the city gate. It doesn't matter if the character is incredibly stealthy (or using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Stealth Boy</a>) or has the combat skills and weapons to take down these mooks with one or two hits each — they still beat the PC up and take all of his/her stuff. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You do get it back later.</span> This one is especially annoying because, in the Enclave example, you might be intimidated or afraid of endangering ol' Dad. With the Pitt Raiders, these are <em>criminals</em> who you kill <em>all the time</em> - in fact, some of your first kills upon exiting the Vault at the start of the game would have been other Raiders exactly like these guys. By that point in the game, you would have more trouble with irradiated animals. And to top it off, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">should</a> be diseased and cancer-stricken anyway! What's worse, to trigger this particular cutscene, you would have <em>just killed four guards outside the damn gate who tried the same thing</em>! This would only be forgivable for a low-level character, which most players won't be because that mission is near the top of the map, and players won't travel that way without being at a decent level.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a> scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. To recap, you sleep with a girl (or with her brother), and their father threatens you with a shotgun into marrying them. Never mind that you carry enough weaponry to level the entire village (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">or no weapons if that's your choice</a>), have enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> to survive at worst two shotgun shots, and may even have a huge muscular tribal with a huge hammer and a mechanic with a rifle as backup. To be fair, there is nothing stopping you from picking up your gun and murdering everyone in the middle of the wedding. The cutscene is not actually enforced, it only happens if the player does nothing to interrupt it.
</li><li> Cate Archer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever">No One Lives Forever</a></em> is an elite government spy, stealthy and quite handy with a gun. And yet, during cutscenes, her idea of sneaking is carelessly clomping around, like Elmer Fudd trying to get the jump on the "wabbit." Inevitably, this leads to her capture. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Twice.</em> And by the same person both times.</span>
</li><li> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geist">Geist</a></em>, the guards are easily killed by the imps in cutscenes. No, these imps are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, and no, they aren't remotely strong.

They are killed by one bullet from any gun. They can be killed with a fucking fire extinguisher, for crying out loud! And yet, in the cutscenes, when guards are confronted by them, you'd think they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> minibosses. In fact, the fire extinguisher doesn't do <em>any</em> damage, it just has the game check if the target has less than 1 HP (this is why guards don't shoot some of your possessed characters even if you spray them with one, because they're not suffering a health loss). The imps are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">Zero Hit Point Wonders</a>.

By the time any player has made it through the hospital, they should be well capable of blasting a Strogg in a tank before it snags their commanding officer. Or maybe Kane just didn't like that guy much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a>: Payback</em> does this in the most obnoxious way possible. Right after defeating two bosses in a row and getting the mission critical briefcase, the lights suddenly go dim and a woman runs straight up to you with a fire extinguisher and hits you, taking you down. She thanks you for doing her dirty work and strolls off with the case. All your character does is utter "Bitch" in contempt. The game then ends on a cliffhanger. Screw you, Activision. Also happens when Taylor is killed in <em>SoF 2</em>. Mullins saw the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> coming outside the window, but didn't try to stop him.
</li><li> During the intro level of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">FEAR</a></em> game, the player is ambushed by Paxton Fettel, who simply pops out from behind an obstacle and swings a wooden board at your head. He moves so slowly that you could easily have ducked under it. Hell, you can actually shoot him once or twice before he actually hits you and it does nothing. Instead, you're knocked out cold.
<ul><li> An even more blatant example. In one of the expansion packs, you have taken a man prisoner. A large explosion distracts your squad long enough for him to make a break for it during the cutscene, while you have a gun pointed directly at him. It gets even worse, though - like the above first scene with Fettel, you never actually lose control during the scene. You can empty <em>five</em> full mags from the SMG into him with no effect. Then he locks you out of a hallway, via glass doors that you and your teammate can't just break until he's got a huge lead on you.
</li><li> FEAR 3 has the player hit in the head again, as both the Point man and Fettel.

</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em> game has a brief but <em>exceptionally</em> annoying one about three-quarters of the way through, when you get caught unawares by a tear-gas canister. In most games that would be no big deal, but your character is <em>wearing a space suit</em> at the time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">How the hell does that even work?</a>
</li><li> In gameplay, monsters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve">Evolve</a></em> are behemoths capable of shrugging off enough firepower to level city blocks. In the ending cutscene for Evacuation, the hunters are dropping Stage 3 monsters left and right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> Vegas 2 - At the start of the last leg of the Recreation Center mission after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the chemical bomb has detonated in the stadium</span>, you and your team notice the main target of the mission as he attempts to leave the scene in disguise. Your character, who should be holding his gun in front of him and pointing it in the general direction of the target but isn't because guns are always lowered during cutscenes regardless of context, yells at him to stop. Instead he takes off clumsily after several seconds of limping and stumbling, during which your character (who is the LEADER of a trained counter terrorist squad and is standing barely fifty feet away) could easily shoot him in the leg, leading to a long chase during which you must fight through anywhere from one to several dozen of his flunkies (depending on difficulty) before you finally corner him. The player can actually avert this example if they react quickly enough by shooting him after their gun comes up as they exit the cutscene. However, doing so instantly kills him and nets you a game over (even if you shot him in the leg with a low powered SMG or pistol round.)

Whenever you don't win a fight, it's game over. But half the time you <em>do</em> win, the story immediately resumes with your character messing up, getting sucker-punched, the enemy being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, a bunch more enemies showing up, or whatever, forcing either the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment to win the day.

This is all well and good with smaller spiders, generic orcs, and the like. A typical hack and slash game. But after you beat Shelob (a gigantic spider)... The scene where Frodo is knocked out and believed dead makes perfect sense in the movie or book. But in the cutscene of this part, Sam hides from just <em>two</em> Orcs. After he just slaughtered at least 40 of them in the previous levels and a huge number of spiders in the cave by his wits and swordsmanship alone. And they're just regular orcs, too — no appearance from the awesome guy at the top of Cirith Ungol who can kangaroo kick people. He appears as a boss in the <em>next</em> level, where it's a requirement to kill at least 80 orcs by yourself, including miniboss varieties. You'd think that he'd defend Frodo's body a bit better.

Fair enough that she didn't know that would happen, but then she goes on to do it a second time.

Later, you can play this mission as Sun Jian himself. In the end-mission cutscene, there will be <em>two</em> Sun Jians: one will flee and one will stay. You guessed it: the one who stayed was the "real" one.

During these cutscenes, though, the heroes are intimidated enough to retreat and trap themselves inside an ancient building, or (later) to give up their Chaos Crystals to Lyric.

The first few ledges are done for you... by an AI that messes it up about 10% of the time and falls off the tower, causing minor damage. For a more straight example: the Robo-Collector captures Headdy in the opening cutscene. When it appears in-game, it is incapable of doing any damage at all.
</li><li> In the first few chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em>, the player becomes accustomed to out-running armed policemen, throwing themselves off buildings, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">jumping between two crane arms on parallel skyscrapers</span>; however, upon reaching Ropeburn, the player finds themselves in a cutscene involving being grabbed and thrown off a small drop by him.

Therefore, you're able to wander freely around the awesome environment solving all sorts of difficult mechanical puzzles and riddles, but whenever you encounter a living person, he either instantly escapes or instantly captures/traps you in some way. Not so bad the first time, but as the game goes on, it gets increasingly annoying.

After destroying the enemies defending the battering ram, a cutscene begins and about 10 fire giants appear, chase you away, and kill one of the heroes. In game, however, 3-4 heroes could easily take them down, and that isn't even counting all the soldiers you used to destroy the ram in the first place.
</li><li> Also in "Let's Go", Gargarensis (alone) taunts Arkantos (with a small army) from behind the iron bars of a big jail fence; once you gain control of your units, you can destroy the wall in less than 5-10 seconds.

For instance, the Demon Palace semi-finals against Alkaid. You get her HP down a certain amount and she'll use Beast Awakening (even if you've successfully countered her enough to lower her morale gauge) and start hitting you in rapid succession.

It's justified by the strength and swiftness of the assassins, but the fact that you are forced to stand there probably speaks to the creators' fear of you successfully intervening.
<ul><li> Later, there's another quest where you have to rescue someone who got suckered into a deadly maze. Completing the quest requires clearing the maze to get the key, and it leads back to the starting area. Immediately on return, you lose control and can't do anything at all until the person you want to rescue is killed. This example reaches absurd levels if the victim gets on a staircase. His would-be killer cannot reach him there, meaning the player can <em>never</em> move, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">and you'll have to reset</a>.
</li><li> There's also the finale of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a> questline. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to a traitor among the Dark Brotherhood tricking you into assassinating members of the Black Hand, the Brotherhood has been dealt a heavy blow. One of the victims happened to be the Listener, which means that the Brotherhood is unable to receive orders from the Night Mother, and thus cannot receive contracts. You and the 4 remaining members of the Black Hand enter a secret underground chamber to perform an ancient ritual in order to contact the spirit of the Night Mother, seeking her guidance. One of the remaining members of the Black Hand is actually the traitor, who intends to kill everyone present, including the Night Mother. This trope comes into play when said traitor makes his move, and the other members just stand there as he announces his intentions and brandishes a dagger. He kills two of the other members without any resistance before the only survivor left realizes "oh shit this guy needs to be stopped", and <em>then</em> the player is allowed to intervene.</span>

Similarly, the very first boss in the game is perhaps easier than the first wild monsters you encounter — if you spent any time at ALL leveling up, that is — and yet after you "defeat" it, your characters are completely exhausted despite the fact that any decent player will have full health, and Kratos will have to come and rescue your sorry ass.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny2">Tales of Destiny 2</a></em> the party has to save Harold from one of her robots gone rogue. Harold is the most powerful character in the game and could likely easily solo it on her own in normal gameplay. Perhaps justified as she was trying to gague the strength of the other characters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> does this in the cathedral in 600 AD; after defeating a large group of Naga-ettes, one will leap out and cheapshot Lucca, providing an opportunity for Frog to make a dramatic appearance and rescue. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> does this to the entire game.
<ul><li> Same goes for the setup for Ayla's first appearance. The party is "hopelessly outnumbered" by a party of 8 Reptites, when they'd just been able to defeat 5 of them moments before. While this might be reasonable your first playthrough (where the party might have just barely beat the reptites), during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> play, your party could very well be so powerful that Crono alone can single-handedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomp</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lavos</a>!
</li><li> Also the brilliance when fighting King Dalton —- your characters parry his fireball, but blithely look behind them —- when King Dalton asks them to, in the middle of a fight. Cue being captured.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> appears for one badass cutscene, before being easily swatted aside and rendered unplayable.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> Saemon Haevarian of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> series only appears in cutscenes. This is a way of enforcing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a> and make sure that the player doesn't get a chance to kill him for his constant (supposedly) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableTraitor">Lovable Traitor</a> ways.
<ul><li> If the player moves fast enough, they can kill Saemon twice. The first time on the ship, he can be killed. If the player has a fast enough spellcaster in the expansion, a finger of death can reach him before he teleports. His death save isn't all that high, so only one or two reloads are sufficient to make sure he dies. Quite possibly the most satisfying kills in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The cutscenes often do things like ensure the capture or death of a character as necessary to advance the storyline. One particular example occurs if you romance Jaheira: You wake up after camping to find a bandit holding her captive with a dagger. You can try to talk him into taking you captive instead of her, which makes the bandit have one of his friends arrow you in the face for exactly half your HP (or, if you're wearing Stone-/ or Iron Skin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">nada</a>). This one attack will always deal half your HP and will always hit you, and once battle is joined, he is just a regular archer. Jaheira does lampshade afterwards that attacks are a bit more deadly if you just stand there unresisting like a pincushion.
</li><li> Near the end, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s romantic interest gets captured by vampires. The problem? All the original four romantic interests use divine magic, three can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnUndead">Turn Undead</a>, and two can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">Holy Hand Grenade</a>-type spells. Even if they normally can make vampires cry uncle or explode into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Ludicrous Gibs</a>, they will get captured just the same. Try to use some kind of protection or seclusion spell on them, up to and including Imprisonment — it still won't work. The Enhanced Edition had the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> (who all can be romanced in some way) avert this trope during this cutscene, but it sort of highlighted the problem for the originals.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, Darth Malak appears as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a> about two-thirds of the way through the game. He's easy enough to beat... until the game takes your controls away from you and cuts away to show your character being defeated.
<ul><li> What makes it all the more jarring is that <em>KOTOR</em> is very deliberately paced with regard to level gaining. A reasonable guess can be made as to what level the player would be at that point, and thus the developers could have made Malak sufficiently powerful to defeat the player fairly. Though the experienced difficulty varies widely with the character level up choices made by the player. To the extent that the final boss can range from a virtual one-turn kill to being completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.
</li><li> Malak himself suffers from a reverse version of this trope in that first battle. It would be more logical for him to be vastly more powerful in game terms, but then he'd just kill you. So it all makes sense if you don't look at his hit points or any other number.
</li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when you are confronted outside your latest butchering ground by a police contingent which says you must surrender and stand trial. If you refuse, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a> statement repeatedly appears saying (in bolded text) that there is no way you could possibly fight your way to the spaceport and off-planet against the entire military. This is a reasonable conclusion, but still... It makes you wonder.
</li><li> No matter if you have a piece of equipment that would render you immune to poison, if a cutscene says you're going to get poisoned, you're going to get poisoned. This is especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in the sequel, where your character gets poisoned twice in cutscenes in rapid succession, then can, with the proper equipment, proceed to fight through a bar with a toxic atmosphere with no trouble whatsoever.
</li><li> The poison in the latter case can be at least partially forgiven, as the poisonous gases supposedly bypass breath masks and enters your body through the skin, requiring a full-on space suit <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or a special breathing force power</span> to survive. This never explains why your cybernetic immune-booster can't take care of it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">and in-game</a>, both those and breath masks will protect you. The <em>first</em> time, however, involves a woman introducing herself as one of the bounty-hunters chasing you, and <strong>somehow</strong> convinces you off-camera to meet with her at an obscure location of her choosing and gasses you there. To top it off, the reason she didn't go down despite breathing the same air as you? <em>She was wearing special protective equipment.</em>
</li><li> Likewise, the fights against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dark-side Bastila</span>. Even when your comrades get stunned, you can probably win in one or two strikes, but she will push you back and restore health fully, all while talking all kinds of smack. Actually justified because she's clinging to the hope of being unbeatable thanks to the power of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star Forge</span>, not her own abilities.
</li><li> As a lesser example, the first duel you see on Taris, Deadeye Duncan vs. Gerlon Two-Fingers, shows Duncan accidentally dropping his blaster just as the duel begins, and Gerlon shooting him as he bends down to pick it up. While Duncan is renowned as a terrible duelist and is by far the easiest enemy in the game outside of the tutorial, he's not quite that incompetent in actual gameplay.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> has a slightly bizarre variant where the cutscenes make 90% of the characters indifferent to their comrade getting wasted right in front of them. The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> case comes in the first game when the whole party stands around looking bored as Jr gets himself throttled from behind by a robot girl, about twenty inches from where they're standing at the time.
<ul><li> The third game certainly gives it a run for its money, though. Early on, the party comes across <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">T-Elos, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> of KOS-MOS</span>. After the obligatory boss fight, the cutscene commences. KOS-MOS states that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">T-Elos</span> is too powerful, and offers to hold her off, knowing she'll be beaten, in order for the party to escape an otherwise certain doom. Kosy charges in, and as promised, begins losing spectacularly. The party just <em>STANDS THERE</em> as KOS-MOS is treated like a rag doll. One would think that if they decided to stay, they would at least help out. Yet all they do is sit there and watch everyone's favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> is torn apart, with Shion occasionally shouting her name whenever a nasty blow is dealt. The result is KOS-MOS almost dying. Strangely enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later on in the game, after KOS-MOS has been rebuilt more uber than before, T-Elos shows up again and the party DOES try. Granted, they failed miserably, but one has to wonder where that team spirit was when KOS-MOS was being mutilated</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, the party is confronted by a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> and a couple of mooks, who demand they surrender. Despite the party having defeated said boss when they were 15-20 levels lower and having butchered their way through umpteen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> with the exact same mooks to get to that point, the party surrenders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CompilationOfFinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CompilationOfFinalFantasyVII">Compilation of Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Cloud is forced to flee from guards that are pathetically easy to defeat in battle. He does it again when the Turks appear in the Shinra building; you've just stormed their building and beaten up half of Shinra without a hitch, but as soon as Rude and Tseng step into the same elevator as Cloud, bam, instant capture. Doesn't help that you've already handed Reno's ass to him earlier in the game, and the Turks haven't been built up to be badass enough to make this believable.
</li><li> When the air tank explodes and traps Shera in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Cloud, who in gameplay is shown to have impossible physical strength, capable of doing anything with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>, suddenly can't lift up a sheet of scrap metal even with the help of a second party member.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> does this backwards and forwards. Zack is nearly unstoppable in gameplay, and one of his side missions has him fighting his way through 1000 Shinra soldiers without breaking a sweat. The opening cutscene and others have him performing similar feats (and more over the top stuff). Then Zack is <em>hurled</em> out of a small base if he's caught during a mandatory stealth mission. Even worse is the battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sephiroth</span>. With a character that is even minutely above minimum level for the fight, it is an utter <em>cakewalk</em> ...until the cutscene showing Zack getting his ass handed to him, to the point of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>total defeat</em> at his hands</span>, requiring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>completely untrained mook Cloud to beat him for you!</em></span>
</li></ul></li><li> In a memorable cutscene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, Tidus and the gang are forced to surrender when they are stopped and held up by guards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as they attempt to break up Seymour and Yuna's wedding</span>. However, in-game, such guards are relatively harmless enemies that are incapable of causing significant damage and can be disposed of in one or two attacks. It makes no sense as to why the party would view them as such a threat.
</li><li> Adding insult to injury on the <em>FFX</em> example above is that your group had just plowed through several waves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> to get to the spot where they are held up by the smaller group of Mooks.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor case shows up in the ending cinematic of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. The party has just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beaten the crud out of <strong>a god</strong>,</span> which comes with weathering the usual "destroy the battlefield" cinematic attacks. Then, during the ending movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fran is knocked unconscious by a few pieces of falling debris</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, events will always happen exactly as scripted regardless of how overpowered you are. However, the main character does call for a Phoenix Down when another character gets killed in a cutscene, which makes him rather smart for a Final Fantasy character; maybe if he'd been in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> he would have gotten one out when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Sephiroth killed Aeris</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, Cecil &amp; Co. defend the first of the Dark Crystals, held behind King Giott's throne room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">With help</a>, they defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Golbez</a> and his summoned monsters. In fact, they trounce him so badly he's reduced to a <em>hand</em>. After they congratulate each other for the victory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingHands">hand comes to life</a> and crawls towards the Crystal, and steals it. We say again: a Paladin, a Dragoon, a Master Monk, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Black Mage</a>/Summoner stand and <em>watch</em> as an animated hand steals the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> and do nothing to stop it.
<ul><li> The DS remake handles this scene a little bit more gracefully; Golbez waits until your team is at the door, THEN announces that he's still alive, gets up (instead of doing the creepy hand thing), dashes for the crystal and warps off with it, all in the space of 2 or 3 seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> does this so often that it sometimes feels like there's two versions of your character. In universe, you are worshipped and praised for stopping whatever evils that pop up and you can feel how strong you get when your character levels up and gets better gear. In a cutscene, however, you never get to actually fight and any fighting that does take place are always handled by an NPC or two while you either watch, escape, or get defeated. Because the game is an MMORPG, the devs can't exactly anticipate what class a player will be when a cutscene with fights happens and the animations would have to be altered for every playable class. There would also be the problem of certain classes that "should be able" to effortlessly dispel whatever problems pop up in the cutscene and potentially alter the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, one character who regularly faces terrible monsters in battle proves unable to take a punch when a cutscene rolls around.
<ul><li> Plus two characters who easily withstand fireballs, lightning bolts, sword slashes, grenades, gunshots, punches from monsters ten times their height and much, much more, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can't even survive a single gunshot <em>from the exact same gun that barely hurt them in combat</em> while under the awesome power of the cutscene</span>.
</li><li> It gets worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One of the guys that goes down to a bullet? He, with sufficient grinding, can gain a skill called 'Null Pierce' which unsurprisingly nullifies damage from 'Pierce' type attacks. Those bullets? They do Pierce Damage.</span>
</li><li> Even if you ignore all of the special abilities they have, at this point it's quite possible to equip your entire party with kevlar armor and various other equipment that could easily render the bullet non-lethal.
</li><li> At another point in the game, the heroes face <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aegis, who's been brainwashed and turned against them</span>. Despite the fact that there's a 7 to 1 advantage for the heroes (4 to 1 even if we assume that in-game battle mechanics apply), and that each side's respective stats would suggest this is going to be a pretty quick and effortless (if somewhat regrettable) beatdown for the good guys, the scene suddenly fades to black as they're attacked, and one scene transition later, they're all bound and ready to hear the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouandMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouandMe">brilliant evil plan</a>.
</li><li> During the October 4th operation, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the heroes arrive just in time to see Shinji get shot by Takaya. Not only do the heroes not heal their friend as he's dying (at least 3 or 4 of your party members have a powerful healing spell by this point), they let Takaya get away</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>, whenever a player character's HP reaches 0, the player can, if there's a nearby ally, always call for the medic. In a cutscene around halfway through the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Isara gets shot, and ultimately dies</span>... Even though all the rest of the main cast surrounding her never think to call Fina over.
<ul><li> What makes it worse is that, in a later cutscene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this time, Alicia gets shot</span>, the characters were quick to call for the medic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> has a particularly infuriating example - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when entering the Lower Ward for the first time, an in-game cutscene will play where two were-rats will grab Morte without him saying a word</span>. Why didn't the Nameless One stop this? Why, because he was talking to a clothes merchant!
<ul><li> The end, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your party gets shredded one by one by a creature they could at least heavily damage, or in Dak'kon's case probably destroy</span>. Oh, for a challenging <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">end boss</a>.</span> To be fair, while he defeats the others alone, he brings overwhelming odds against Dak'kon. Thus each separate fight is believable if we assume he could heal between them.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Dio"/Odie</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters">Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters</a></em> is presented as a bumbling, inept joke of a sorcerer. In actual gameplay, he's fairly powerful and a valuable addition to the team.
</li><li> An early plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII">Phantasy Star II</a></em> is that you need to stop Darum, a criminal, from causing trouble by rescuing his daughter Teim. So you rescue her and offer to bring her to Darum to defuse the whole situation. But since he's got enemies who might be gunning for her too, she dons a veil so they won't recognize her. Okay, fine, let's go have a loving reunion. But when you find Darum, she just walks up to him, veil <em>still on,</em> and since he doesn't recognize her, he demands money. She refuses <em>instead of taking off the veil.</em> So he gets pissed and kills her. <em>Then</em> he takes off her veil, realizes he's killed his own daughter, and commits suicide by explosives. In other words, two people just killed themselves over a tragic mistake while your party just <em>stood</em> there, not saying or doing anything that might've cleared the confusion. It may have been her plan all along to commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">suicide by proxy</a> out of the shame she felt for his actions, or give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>. That doesn't excuse the party for standing there and letting her, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse">Phantasy Star Universe</a></em> keeps mentioning the main characters ignorance and self-reliance in every other cutscene... even though the game forces the player to operate with a team or die. Probably one of the worst examples is two cutscenes during an early boss fight. During normal play the boss is vulnerable to guns and his special moves can be easily avoided by moving one step to the left or right. During the cutscenes, the boss is immune to guns and the special attacks can't be dodged.
</li><li> From the official add-ons for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/ShadowsOfUndrentide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/ShadowsOfUndrentide">Shadows of Undrentide</a></em>, you and your henchman inevitably get petrified by a medusa at the end of the Interlude between the campaign's two chapters: Heurodis, the Big Bad of the expansion. Normal game rules would allow you to attempt a Fortitude save to resist, but in this case you aren't even given a chance to try.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/HordesOfTheUnderdark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverwinterNights/HordesOfTheUnderdark">Hordes of the Underdark</a></em>, you have the option to take out a large number of drow holding a formian hive in slavery, or just sneak by. If you agree to save the formians, you're treated to a cutscene of your character storming through the gates and shouting to call the enemies' attention to themselves. Not very fun if you're playing say a rogue or some other character who was hoping to rely on stealth, tactics, and maybe not taking on every enemy in the area at once.
</li></ul></li><li> After completing the Mystech tunnels early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox">Anachronox</a></em>, you are assaulted by a cutscene with the gangster boss Detta and a couple of thugs, who proceed to demand you hand over your primary find. Your boss Grumpos insist on fighting since he really, REALLY wants to keep the rare find, but our hero Sly folds like a wet blanket, even knocking Grumpos down on his own. This comes back to bite everyone in the end. To be fair you fight a similar brand of mook as the bodyguards Detta has with him as somewhat-competent (for mooks) opponents in the last dungeon of the game. At the point you face Detta you just beat the very first boss in the game, your very low level and only have one ally. Assuming that the bodyguards are as strong as their mook counterparts run into later Sly and Grumpos were no where close to strong enough to beat them at this point. So in reality Sly probably made the right choice. A bigger question is why Detta claimed to need Sly and Grumpos to clear out all the monsters in the cave when his overpowered mook bodyguards could have done it easily. Another possibility is that, at this point in the game, Sly is still a borderline alcoholic shell of a man, and still has fresh in his mind a beating one of Detta's goons had given him at the beginning of the game. It seems likely that Sly was too scared of Detta and his goons at that stage of the game to dare cross them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> has a fairly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example. The Hero comes across his long-lost father Ortega in the depths of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zoma's</a> Castle. Ortega is fighting a battle against a powerful monster, and seems to be holding his own, but finally runs out of MP for healing and dies. Neither the Hero nor his party considers joining the battle, providing the needed healing, or using one of their spells or items to bring Ortega back to life after he dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em>. Your team is captured by guards that you could probably kill with a single attack each when they're accused of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing an important religious figure</span>. Naturally, they don't attempt to explain the actual situation at all, and let the guards throw them in a supposedly inescapable jail for the better part of a month, because... well, who knows? The heroes were not fighting back because the guards were innocent... but they probably could have just ran out onto the balcony and activated their portable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">Global Airship</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, on Feros, you encounter mind controlled colonists in the Zhu's Hope colony; you can try not to kill them (by using special narcotic gas grenades or punching them); this works quite well and many players manage to actually not kill any colonist at all - but then, the colony's leader Fai Dan appears in a cutscene, pointing a gun at Shepard and saying that he doesn't want to kill Shepard, then shooting himself in the head. However, the player would have already incapacitated him with a gas grenade at that point.
<ul><li> This also interacts hilariously with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> feature. As the first mission begins, you start with Kaidan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Richard L. Jenkins</a> as your squadmates. The latter seems like a normal party member, down to having skill points that you can allocate to abilities, but is killed by without firing a shot a couple minutes in by a basic Geth drone. In the first playthrough, he's weak enough for this to make sense. However, in a second playthrough, he, like everyone else, will be a level 50-something badass who you can give a fully maxed-out Combat Armor stat and the best armor in the game. He still dies in one shot.
</li><li> A villainous example in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kai Leng's fight against Thane Krios on the Citadel. Rather than simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssassinOutclassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssassinOutclassin">cloak, shoot Thane down with his palm blaster, stab the Councillor, and run</a> before Shepard can get down from the balcony s/he's standing on, he takes Thane in a fair fight - contrary to how you'd expect an <em>assassin</em> to fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">and his behaviour in the novels.</a> Thane does it too in that fight. He's an assassin as well, known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">sudden appearances</a> that usually result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">snapped necks</a>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">capable sniper</a> and is packing powerful biotics. Yet his entrance involves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClickHello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClickHello">*Click* Hello</a> with a pistol from roughly three feet away from Kai Leng (instead of just shooting him immediately), then choosing to engage him in a fistfight despite his opponent being a cybernetically-augmented martial artist with super strength (in that very scene Leng pulls a five meter vertical lump while wearing heavy armor), resulting in him getting stabbed. Mind you, Thane has a disease that makes physical activity very difficult</span>.
</li><li> Not to mention that Shepard and the rest of the party just sit back and watch the extended hand-to-hand fight, instead of trying to help out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> pretty much every character ever who dies in a cutscene has their armor turn into Stormtrooper armor, their shields are disabled, and they never use their medi-gel (or they lose it, and no one else uses it on them). And on top of all that, the weapons of Shepard's squadmates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">take on PC effectiveness</a>, rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">doing significantly less damage than everyone else's</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The sole exception to this rule is Urdnot Wrex, if you betray the krogan while he's in charge - assuming he removed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">biotic amp</a> to avoid Citadel sensors - he takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration">reasonable</a> amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Carnifex</a> or Avenger fire to take down, and gets to have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords">Last Words</a> too</span>.
</li><li> Kaidan is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">biotic</a>, and a powerful one at that; it's stated relatively often that the outdated implant he has, because he was one of the first human biotics, gives him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">severe migraines but also a significant boost to his biotic strength</a>. In the first game, if you level him up right, he can take on hordes of enemies by himself, and though he's slightly nerfed in the third game, he's still a force to be reckoned with if you play him right. Yet in every single cutscene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(apart from a single one in the Citadel DLC)</span> his biotics are completely forgotten about, and he simply relies on a pistol instead. This is especially jarring when he's paired with Liara, who takes every chance (especially in the first game), to show off her biotics in cutscenes.

<ul><li> During gameplay, your character can take shotgun blasts at point blank and not even be slowed down, particularly if you've been investing heavily in Stamina and Fortitude. In a cutscene, one cheap shot with a baseball bat is enough to knock you unconscious, and presumably would have left you incapacitated while three Sabbat vampires tortured you to death were it not for the intervention of another character. (On the other hand, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a> inside the gameplay is always an instant kill, even if you use a baseball bat on a vampire.)

The first major time is near the beginning when trying to escape Alfard, Sagi and Guillo find themselves at the sword-points of soldiers that they were (under player control) soundly and easily defeating so that Milly can come save them. It also happens every time you fight a machina arma; sometimes it would be impossible to beat, but other times you could easily have trashed the enemy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>: Every class has the ability to prevent enemy movement, with friendly fire very possible.

<ul><li> A rogue's stealth mode is instantly canceled when entering a cutscene. This is especially infuriating when you approach a group of enemies stealthed and then enter a cutscene for the Mooks to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner">Pre Ass Kicking One Liner</a> (seriously, not a dialogue, just one "Arrr, you might have the intestines of our 100 other comrades spray-painted on your armor, but THIS fight against 5 generic bandits will surely end differently" line).

The whole party will walk into the room even if they're supposed to be holding their position and be put to sleep.

</li><li> In the sequel, it has been shown that some of the characters can be quite competent even in cutscenes. For example, a Witty Hawke can throw a blade into a slaver's head during a cutscene while the slaver holds a hostage. Varric will shoot a supposed ally in the back when said ally starts turning on the group. Even so, when Grace turns on Ser Thrask and Hawke, no one bothers to take the next 3 dialogues worth of time to kill her. Hilariously, this can be inverted in the final battle against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Knight-Commander Meredith</span>. The villain has an attack that stuns everyone on the playing field while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> goes through a very, very extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>... but, if you've given Aveline or a sword-and-shield Hawke the 'Indomitable' ability, they're immune to stunning and can continue to wail on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">as much as they want</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most fans complain about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU">.hack//G.U.</a></em>: Volume One—in which an overpowered Haseo takes on an underpowered Alkaid in the arena, but before you land the finishing blow, a cutscene is triggered in which your character whines about how powerful his opponent is and summons his avatar for help. The game tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> this by having Alkaid during the gameplay part of the fight activate a hyper-mode, allowing her to wail on you while you sit there frozen in time. However, if you're grossly overleveled, our hero Haseo gets beaten by a flurry of attacks that each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">do 1-2 damage.</a>
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a> crops up frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, there are also times where the player, despite their skill and power giving them the edge, are forced to allow certain events to occur. Characters are stunned, the enemy is not targetable, an attack insta-kills despite all the abilities countering it. If Blizzard wants you to see a certain game event take place a certain way, you can't do anything about it.
<ul><li> Certain classes have magical powers that make resurrection from the dead even more trivial. However, if a character, no matter how powerful, needs to die for story reasons, their death will be considered permanent (assuming you're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow">Fighting a Shadow</a> and the character isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">Faking the Dead</a>). For example, Garrosh Hellscream's father, Grom, was killed during the events of <em>Warcraft III</em>. Lore dictates that he will never show up in Orgrimmar, alive, and say "What? I got a rez." Even though there are in-game events in which someone is brought back to life by NPCs and players alike, everyone just forgets about it when it would be convenient. There is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explanation for this discrepancy.
</li><li> Similarly there are a countless number of quests that involve healing a wounded, poisoned, or sick NPC. The player may have a dedicated healer that can bring the most powerful of heroic tanks from 1% health to full power in seconds, and yet they can't heal the orphan kid that tripped and sprained his ankle without a long quest chain. An argument may be made that the NPCs who suffer from sickness or poison are affected by obscure poisons the PC doesn't know how to heal, but this doesn't justify the countless wounded NPCs that either need to be saved by someone else or die after speaking to you while you don't lift a finger to heal them.
</li><li> Perhaps one of the most aggravating (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">and most tragic</a>) for some players in the original game was the difficult escort of Taelen Fordring out of Hearthglen. After fighting through dense clusters of elite mobs and nearing safety, the players have no choice but to watch him be killed at the climax of the quest.
</li><li> <em>Cataclysm</em>, with its more proactive storytelling, brings several annoyingly semi-justified instances. It's not that much of a stretch that you'd be unable to do anything but go down with the others onboard when your ship is attacked by a humongous kraken... except that you may well be sitting on a flying mount when the cutscene starts, and could easily be thirty meters up in the air in a matter of seconds. And sure, an endless stream of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> of your own level would be too much for anyone eventually, but it doesn't feel fair when this is represented by them stunning and grabbing you when you're still at something like 85% health. And an ogre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">feinting</a> and then grabbing you in his huge hands when your guard is down and threatening to drop you to your death from the airship makes some sense, but you'd think a character who may by then have defeated several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlords</a> personally would be able to do <em>something</em>... (At least the dungeon Throne of the Tides gives the satisfying chance to both save a character who's kept on saving you, and to grow giant-sized to easily kill that damn kraken.)
</li><li> The Harrison Jones questlines in Uldum. The most implausible would be Schnottz, our <em>World of Warcraft</em> parody of a Nazi leader, getting ready to kill you with a rocket gun, even though you've already fought off all manner of monsters and gods at this point.
</li><li> In the Silverpine Forest quests, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sylvanas</span> is killed with a single bullet from behind by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vincent Godfrey</span>. The shooter is either around Level 21 or a Level 87 5-man boss, whereas the victim has over 100 million health and requires a full raid to defeat. Additionally, the similarly strong Varian Wrynn's life is threatened by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> in his throne room, as he says he would have died if not for Anduin's shielding him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> goes down easily against a single Level 84 player and the guards.
</li><li> Another example involves a minor quest in one of the new <em>Cataclysm</em> zones. The hero is fighting an NPC that tosses him off the platform you're standing on, requiring you to be saved by another NPC before you fall to your doom. For most people this is appropriate: While nearly any character at this level has a flying mount, they couldn't be on the mount at the time they are tossed since they would have been dismounted when they started the fight; it would take too long to summon the mount before you fall. However, one class, the Druid, has the magical ability to turn into a bird at will and so should never be threatened by a fall of any height. While less blindingly obvious, the other classes also have other methods of avoiding damage from the fall, even if they couldn't immediately fly back up to confront the monster again the way a Druid can.
</li><li> Taken to ridiculous extremes in the <em>Legion</em> expansion. By this point, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> is a veteran of countless battles and has killed more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> than probably every major character in the series combined. And this isn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> either, the game is constantly going out of its way to tell you how awesome you are. If you're a Warrior, for example, Odyn will outright say you're the greatest living warrior on Azeroth. And now you're the head of your class's respective order, and you wield an artifact weapon of unimaginable power. Sounds like you're a real badass, right? Well, don't expect that to stop you from getting kidnapped by a couple of dim-witted Naga, or from some no-name NPC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount">stunning you and running away right before you kill them</a> every other quest.
</li></ul></li><li> Characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> have all sorts of crazy movement abilities (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirJousting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirJousting">midair combat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">lightning fast movement</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">rapid teleportation</a>) and spells in gameplay.

</li><li> Similarly, there is a scene where Riku and Kairi are struggling against a horde of <em>Shadow Heartless</em>. In-game, they are the weakest enemies and incredibly easy to kill, yet in this cutscene they're strategically jumping around and dodging the heroes' attacks.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one cutscene in <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>. At one point, Donald and Goofy are captured by a few Strafers (which are among the weakest Heartless in the game), and Sora orders his friends to "show them who's boss". Then the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMonsters">Heartless Commander</a>" shows up and orders them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">torture</a> the duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">right in front of Sora</a>, causing him to surrender.

The bit with Terra-Xehanort is probably the worst, where he wipes the floor with the team in spite of being outnumbered <em>nine-to-one.</em> To wit:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Aqua realizes that Terra is actually Terra-Xehanort, she makes no attempt to fight him and instead stands around waiting for him to make the first move.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After he strikes down Ventus, Aqua just kneels there and spends the rest of the battle processing what just happened.</span>

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em>: While not the player character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Eagun's</a> Lv. 50 Pikachu goes up against a Cipher Peon's Lv. 35 Shadow Hitmontop. The cutscene plays out like an actual battle... with the Pikachu using only Quick Attack. At that level, he could have easily roasted even a Shadow Pokémon using a move like Thunder.
</li><li> Done in real time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> where after defeating a Team Flare Grunt, he still refuses to move out of your way. The point of a hostile Pokémon battle is that it's dangerous for a human to try to fight even low level Pokémon on their own so once your team is exhausted you have no choice but to listen to the guy with an attack dog still on their feet or run for the nearest Pokémon Center. So it becomes pretty glaring when your way is completely stopped because a single completely helpless grunt can block off a path by standing there (with no other form of excuse like other similar walls where you might just be being polite).
</li><li> Happens early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em>. You are confronted by a large amount of guards. After fighting a couple of squads of them, your character decides there's just too many of them. Worth noting is that if the high-magic party member has the fire rune, she can usually end both fights with a single spell.
</li><li> Similar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: The Silver Star</a></em>. When approaching the Grindary, the party is surrounded by a wave of moves. After a single fight, where your two mages can effortlessly slaughter the whole group by themselves. Everyone fears for the worst, prompting another round with similarly effortless results. Cue good-bye "we're doomed" lines. Subverted earlier in the game, where the party of newbies is surrounded by monsters that are a decent challenge at normal level. After the first wave is driven off Laike appears and offers help. It clearly appears to be this trope, but if you consistently refuse his help, fighting a new wave of monsters each time, you will eventually defeat them all on your own. It will be a hard fight unless you've done a bit of grinding or loaded up on healing items though, the players are justified in being afraid of fighting without help.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI">Breath of Fire</a></em>, you get stranded on an island. Gobi shows up and extorts you into a huge debt in return for him getting the Gills that will allow you to breathe underwater and leave the island. Nina has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">warp spell</a> that will teleport you instantly to any town you've visited, but since the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">switches you to Gobi</a> until you finish the Gills quest, you never get the opportunity to cast it. Then again, your destination is somewhere you've never reached before and considering the trouble you went to getting a ship, only for it to get attacked by the Dark Dragons and sink, it's reasonable to take Gobi up on his offer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> has a cutscene with the player character standing still and doing nothing while the villain kills his dog, kidnaps his allies, and shoots him in the face. The hero has a gun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em>, when you encounter an enemy who can be a friend during gameplay, you can select the talk option. In Eliwood's game, however, the dragon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ninian</span> appears to you in a cutscene, leading to a quick slice followed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">breaking speech</a> from Nergal once Eliwood discovers what he did. Lampshaded when Eliwood comments that the legendary weapon seemed to carry him along of its own will (and he says this before the reveal, so it isn't just dodging blame).
<ul><li> Inverted in a few cutscenes after the Hold Out For X Turns types of missions, where highly powerful and valuable enemy troops will suddenly flee when a small reinforcement contingent of the allied troops arrives that they had been tearing apart just a few turns earlier.
</li><li> Similarly, some "Survive" or "Defend" missions - even a handful of "Rout" missions - feature scripted sequences in which your protagonists will sound desperate, saying things like "There are too many!" or "We can't hold out much longer!"...even if you're completely destroying the enemy. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> almost certainly arrive at this point.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>:
<ul><li> A partial example; at the end of Chapter 13, Chrom is attacked by an assassin, but is narrowly saved by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lucina</span>. What makes this amusing is that the dreaded assassin fights Chrom within the normal combat interface, and is given completely unremarkable stats. It's difficult to take the attempt on Chrom's life seriously when the game clearly displays that the assassin wouldn't have been capable of doing more than single-digit damage, if any at all, and the assassin never procs the Assassin skill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Lethality</a> in that cutscene, which is odd, because that would have totally eliminated this trope because Dual Guarding is one of the very few ways (apart from proccing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">Miracle</a> or dodging) one can be saved from Lethality.
</li><li> In a bizarre case of this happening to a villain instead of a hero, in Chapter 5, Ricken is able to stun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Aversa</a> long enough for him to free Maribelle and make a run for it by hitting her with wind magic. At this point in the game, Ricken is only level 3, while Aversa is a near-endgame boss and has the stats you'd expect from one. Using their ingame stats Ricken's attack would have done absolutely no damage, even with the damage bonus from hitting a flier with wind magic (and Aversa wasn't even on her pegasus at the time) but the cutscene acts like the attack completely crippled her.
</li></ul></li><li> A somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonName">Corrin</a> frequently gets handed the cutscene incompetence ball when fighting their older brothers. On the one hand, Xander and Ryoma <em>are</em> established to be strong warriors, and have the stats to back it up... But it gets somewhat egregious late in the game when Corrin is <em>still</em> getting their ass handed to them by Xander before his final boss fight. Even if Corrin's stats are close to or better than his by this point, you wouldn't guess that from the cutscene's dialogue. One of the fights with Ryoma is especially bad since, in the cutscene <em>before</em> the chapter, Corrin's Cutscene Incompetence allows Laslow to get a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> instead.
</li><li> The original <em>Prophecies</em> campaign to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> had a frustrating example in that Prince Rurik's death while leading his people to safety is an important plot point of the game's first Act. The fact that the party of four players present will have at least one person capable of resurrecting him in <em>3 to 8 seconds</em> is never brought up as the party opts to leave him dead in the wilderness without so much as a proper burial. The closest thing to a justification is that a tree fell on him.
</li><li> Dog in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum">Arcanum</a></em> suffers an instance of 'off-screen incompetence' shortly before you first meet him. He's one of the most useful followers you can recruit to assist you in combat, starting off as a level 12 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> and becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> at later levels. When you find him, he's been subdued by a level one gnome civilian.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> games are constantly forcing Lan and MegaMan to avoid fights they could easily win. A particularly blatant example occurs in BN5 when you're faced with a small army of HeelNavis; MegaMan and ProtoMan/Colonel decide to recruit a tank for their team and come back. What's wrong with this? Not only <em>could</em> you win this fight, the previous game required you to! Tetsuke's scenario pit MegaMan against 20 HeelNavis, and that was without three teammates backing him up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> this seems to be the ultimate superpower of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Iconians</a>. When one makes its first appearance on Qo'nos, it casually vaporizes the Klingon High Council then disappears <em>while a virtual army of NPCs and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> are standing there</em> doing nothing. The entirety of Season 10: The Iconian War shows this trope in full swing as a player could have equipment and skills powerful enough to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Herald</a> ships and troops disappear just by blinking, but the game and the NPCs will tell you that, no, you're caught in a losing battle.

When you see the battle, not only are their stats nowhere near what they should be, but you can see that they've been reduced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">having ALL their Djinn ready to summon</a> (a situation that should only occur at the <em>beginning</em> of a boss battle, and even then only if you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">confident your party can survive in their weakened state</a>).

You can still fight - and beat them easily; but, with the game being what it is, player then simply gets bashed with a hammer in a cutscene. May be justified, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> the combat (at least, between kids) is just live action role play.
</li><li> This happens quite often in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries">Trails Series</a></em>.

<ul><li> Early in the game your first wingman, 'Shadow', is shot down in a cutscene during a battle that you are present for while you just sit there and watch.
</li><li> After discovering Jazz is the traitor you go after him and shoot him down and he ejects. Then there's a cutscene of him in your sights while he pleads for you not to shoot him. You get no option to shoot him before another pilot swoops in and tractors him in to take him back to the carrier to stand trial. Unsurprisingly he later escapes and one of your fellow pilots chews you out for not shooting him when you had the chance...
</li><li> Also from cutscenes we learn the TCS Concordia has the worst security of any ship in the Terran navy, which is saying a lot considering how many times the Confederation is infiltrated throughout the series. Cutscenes show a saboteur on the Concordia literally gets away with murder for a long time until he's arrested in an unrelated incident. He also manages to disable flight operations on the ship not once, but twice, by planting bombs on the flight deck. As if that wasn't absurd enough, the cutscenes show the bombs planted in the exact same spot on the flight deck both times! That spot might as well have a sign stating "plant bombs here".

Had the player been in control at that point, Snake could have easily defeated the guards, or even snuck around the camera altogether.

Unless the player thinks to hit the Start button to end the cutscene; unlike skipping most cutscenes, the game does <em>not</em> jump to the aftermath of it. Instead, Ocelot will still be in the middle of his reload and the now player-controlled Snake can get in a free hit.

</li><li> To say nothing of Snake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">not simply shooting Liquid in the head with his M4 carbine</a> and ending the game right there in a cutscene in Act 3, instead inexplicably choosing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">approach the unarmed, much younger, and equally as skilled martial artist</a>, gleefully getting in position where he can be grappled, disarmed and stabbed with his own knife. This is even more egregious when you consider that the explicit objective of Snake's mission throughout the entire game is to assassinate Liquid, and when handed a golden opportunity, he promptly forgets what a 'trigger finger' is.

This doesn't even count the free shot Snake has at Liquid in ACT ONE. Not only does he have several rifles in his inventory, he attempts to snipe Liquid with his handgun. He then stands there for about 30 straight seconds while nobody even knows he's there, and never does actually attempt to fire.

This results in one of the team members being killed in an ambush, while your helicopter pilot responds by taking off and leaving the team behind.
</li><li> In the original game, Jill Valentine needs to be saved by Barry from: A ceiling trap, snake poison, a giant plant, a Hunter, Wesker, and even a single zombie. The thing is, most of these cutscenes are optional depending on your path, and Jill is completely able to deal with everything by herself in-game. In the <em>REmake</em>, she at least will stomp on the zombie that pops out of a bath tub you're required to drain. Chris just stands there and waits for it to get up. Also, he actually loses his handgun in the game's opening FMV, forcing him to spend the first 5 minutes of the game with only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">puny knife.</a>

This is even more glaring in <em>Zero</em>, which takes place a day before the first <em>Resident Evil</em>, where she is more competent than she was in the original game. Rebecca's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> is sometimes fan-justified because, by the point Chris meets her in <em>Resident Evil</em>, she has been awake for several days and her team is found dead over the course of the game.

Everything from from falling from a pole on a broken bridge, a <em>gust of wind</em>, falling from a helicopter (that she somehow grabbed onto), and twice being grabbed and pulled out of the way of something. And the two times <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she and Jake are captured by Carla Radames/Neo-Umbrella</span> she is effortlessly taken out first.

Yet, in a late-game cutscene, he is attacked by <em>the single weakest monster type in the game</em>. It knocks him down and gets on top of him, rendering him apparently completely helpless and he forgets he has that building-hurling weapon and every single one of those aforementioned powers, any of which could have saved him.

He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> how he's clumsy and screwing up.

Then they have to go through a whole town full of armed humans. The player's reward for all this is being treated to a scene in which Ellie is choked out and captured by one man attacking her in a frontal assault. The game hits this trope a couple of times. One of the game mechanics is a skill called "Listening" which acts as a sort of sonar to show images of enemies behind walls and in other rooms. Perfect for avoiding or spotting upcoming ambushes, right? Except occasionally the game decides it's time for a scripted ambush for plot reasons and that's when listening suddenly doesn't reveal the enemies who ambush, even if the ambush looks very obvious from the level design. The above example is particularly bad because when its triggered, you've likely just finished clearing a room, see a blocked door, and making sure you can't be ambushed, attempt to open the door only for an enemy to just teleport in behind Ellie and grab her.
<p></p></li><li> In one level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAssault">Star Fox: Assault</a></em>, Fox is forced to fight on foot as he destroys devices jamming the friendly pilots' radar. After doing so, he is given an Arwing to join the sky battle - cue cutscene. The Arwing explodes as Fox approaches it, apparently sabotaged by the aparoids, which then jump up to surround Fox on the rooftop. These are the same enemies that you've spent the whole level (and most of the game) mowing down by the hundred, and you're almost certainly packing a machine gun and rocket launcher at this point. But Fox doesn't even draw his weapon - he just stands there awkwardly as the aparoids loom menacingly instead of attacking - cutscene incompetence on their part, come to think of it. Wolf rightfully calls him a "pitiful sight" as he flies to the rescue.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em>, Isaac Clarke fights through hordes of Necromorphs and his armor in game is able to survive most of their hits, and in sections of the game can tank assault weaponry. He also has the strength to fight off Necromorph attacks and smash them with his punches. However in Chapter 5, Clarke walks into a room while disengaging his helmet and is suddenly ambushed and grabbed by his shoulders by two armorless henchmen. He stands there apparently restrained, not bothering to put his helmet back up, apparently about to be escorted to his enslavement before being saved by a gunship trying to take him down. Later in the game Clarke also encounters a crazy man (Stross) attempting to take out Isaac's eyeball with a screwdriver. The moment the armorless Stross grabs Clarke, Clarke's nearly indestructible helmet disengages, and Clarke now has trouble fighting off Stross despite Clarke's superior strength.

Never mind the fact that there were only about 5 or so and CJ can easily take down more than twice that in normal gameplay, plus the 50 or so enemy gang members he just killed before the cutscene. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though to be fair most of the time he doesn't have his brother next to him struggling to stay alive from gunshot wounds.</span>
</li><li> In "Ice Cold Killa", the mission objectives force you to sneak into Jizzy B.'s brothel through a skylight, then take a stealthy route to the main floor, cap Jizzy, and take his phone. Not only does CJ interrupt the game with a cutscene in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">completely breaks cover and waves a gun in Jizzy's face</a>, but CJ <em>still fails to shoot him</em>. When the game resumes, Jizzy is long gone, and CJ is pinned down by his guards. The only way to make any part of CJ's plan look even halfway-intelligent is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoot out the tires of the car Jizzy will use to escape before you get inside</span>.
</li><li> Even better example: One late-game mission features CJ meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tenpenny</a> in the middle of the desert for another typically shady deal with no witnesses. CJ not only hands over all his weapons the moment Pulaski points a gun at him, but also digs graves for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Hernandez</a> (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant">executed</a> in cold blood in front of him) and himself, so Pulaski doesn't have to get sweaty. If it wasn't for the fact that Hernandez <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">wasn't quite dead yet</a>, the cutscene very likely would have led to CJ letting himself be buried in an unmarked grave, neither he nor his snazzy jetpack to ever be seen again.
</li><li> The story missions rely on this more and more as the later games in the series move toward more complex storylines rather than just doing stuff for money. Because when you're playing as the kind of sublime badass that is a GTA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">the obvious solution</a> to being blackmailed or threatened with violence comes to mind pretty quickly. And it isn't to placate the offenders by running errands for them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">GTA 5</a></em> is probably the most egregious, because you now have <em>three</em> guys who each qualify as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> running jobs for increasingly unlikeable people. While there's the occasional bit of catharsis, it's typically infuriating, not helped when one of the other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">asks to your face</a> why you didn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">kill the bastard</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the so-called "death wish" ending, you do. Every, single, one of them that gave you trouble along the way ends up in a very bad way. And it's typically <em>easier</em> to do that than most of the missions that lead up to it!</span> In particular, Trevor is a psychotic lunatic with a short fuse and a penchant for violence with no flair for long-term planning and utter contempt for anyone who tries to tell him what to do. How he didn't cave in the skull of smug <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> Steve Haines within seconds of meeting him is a mystery.
</li><li> <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> has this happen in the Doomsday Heist update. At the end of it, you're tasked with killing the main villain who's fleeing in a jetpack. Once you catch up with him, all four player characters instantly lose all of their brain cells, pull out the <em>starting pistol</em> for no reason at all and simply let the baddie taunt them as he just casually floats right in front of them before he flies off into the sky while everyone suddenly gets Stormtrooper aim when they try to shoot him down. This is egregiously hard to watch if you're doing the Criminal Mastermind challenges, because it all could just easily end right there, had the player characters still been in our control.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em>, just before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you get to save Lyn</span>, you get knocked out by a single hit from a baseball bat. Never mind that in game you would have just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">turned around and instantly shot him</a> with your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">.44 Shepherd</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> averts this trope. The player character can absorb dozens of rifle bullets and grenades even while high and drunk at the same time, kill a hundred enforcers with body armor and rifles so advanced that the U.S. military doesn't even have them, and ignore explosions several feet away that send cars flipping through the air. And in one mission, he is captured by the Sons of Samedi after he's so busy shooting one of his unconscious attackers to finish him off, he doesn't notice the guy running up at him and whacking him in the chin with a baseball bat. This seems like this trope if you've never been hit by an in-game baseball bat, but knocking you out of the fight for a few seconds is exactly what a baseball bat <em>does</em> in the game, and if you've been hit by one before this moment it's far more acceptable.
</li><li> At least it happens to enemies, too: when you're battling Maero man-to-man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFleshWeakSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFleshWeakSteel">he can take several times more damage than an armored personnel carrier</a>. During a later cutscene, you kill him with a single 9mm bullet (admittedly, that bullet goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">right to the temple</a>).
</li><li> Another cutscene from the end of the Ronin storyline zig-zags this. The fight preceding it ends with you likely stabbing your opponent through the chest with a katana, then in the cutscene afterwards he's not only alive and well, but suddenly and effortlessly kicking your ass, taunting the Boss and asking if they really thought they could beat him in a sword fight. The Boss admits they can't, so then decides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">they're just gonna cheat</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a> 2</em>, there's one point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Manganos</span> take over some of your businesses while you're forced to watch the cutscene of them doing so. If it were gameplay you could have gone into action and stopped at least one attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs">Sleeping Dogs</a></em>, the protagonist spends the game beating gangs of bad guys, yet in the final mission a single thug knocks him out from behind and captures him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza">Yakuza</a></em>: all character's IQ drops about 50 points whenever a gun enters the situation. Kazuma Kiryu especially has a bad habit of just walking away from armed villains he just beat in a fistfight, often leading to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> people he cares about getting killed by the people he just beat up</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeNewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeNewYorkCity">True Crime: New York City</a></em>, Marcus enters Benjamin's studio where upon entering, he is grabbed from behind. He is then shown to be tied to a chair and is about to be killed by Benjamin, but gets lucky. Never mind the fact that Marcus could easily free himself from being grabbed, fight a group of people single handedly, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">possibly know every fighting style the dojos have to offer.</a>
</li><li> Very common throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> series. Examples:
<ul><li> In the first game, Frank West can be captured and stripped naked by a scrawny little punk with a gun after spending the whole game getting shot at and slicing through zombies.
</li><li> In the third game, one of the boss fights begins with Nick getting ambushed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">evil doctor</a> despite, again, spending his time getting shot at and slicing through zombies.
</li><li> Even bosses aren't immune: there's an optional boss fight against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">basement-dwelling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek">Geek</a> Kenny Dermot. While he's no pushover in-game <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gjdv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gjdv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gjdv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he's sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss">Mirror Boss</a>, as his motivation is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeYou">take Nick's place</a></span>, the cutscenes show Kenny to be a hapless, out of shape dork; he gets no respect from his hostage, and when defeated, he falls to the ground wheezing and begs Nick to save him from incoming zombies.

<ul><li> Any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> game that follows the movies, allowing the player to plow through enemies but still get captured and/or defeated as required, for example having the player face Darth Vader in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> and defeat him in gameplay, only to have him cut off Luke's hand in a cutscene. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> gets a notable example in its recreation of the Battle of Hoth, wherein you effortlessly destroy all of the AT-STs and AT-ATs attacking the base before they can close in, only for the shield generator to blow up anyway once you've passed the required number of waves. Some later games which straight-up recreate the Battle of Hoth, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefrontII">Star Wars: Battlefront II</a></em>, notably avoid the issue of the Rebels somehow losing despite all in-game logic and reason saying otherwise by having you play as the Empire instead.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Non Video Game Examples </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the old school book-based adventure <em>Deathtrap Equalizer</em> for the tabletop RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TunnelsAndTrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TunnelsAndTrolls">Tunnels &amp; Trolls</a></em> a scenario exists where the player is faced with a sorceress wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">stripperiffic</a> outfit and accompanied by two polar bears. If the player attempts to use offensive magic, the book tells the player that the magic doesn't work and the sorceress has noticed the attempt and she has ordered her bears to attack you. The player dies because "you have no magic to help you". However, if you attack the bears with weapons they prove tough, but not completely impossible for a competent character to defeat without magic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSwarm">The Tyranids</a> encounter this in their codex for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40K</a></em>. While most Codices are filled with the annals of success for their respective armies (with maybe a few crushing defeats or pyrrhic victories thrown in for flavor) the Tyranids lose every single one of their battles listed in the codex, and at one point are out-adapted by the Tau, a race notorious for rigid doctrine and regimented discipline. Much blame has been laid on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the writer of said codex being notoriously hateful of the Tyranids</a>, though the in-universe justification seems to be "if they won, you wouldn't be around to hear about it".
</li><li> A common trope in pulp novels is "hero gets captured by bad guy". The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem">Pulp Hero</a></em> rulebook notes that players <em>hate</em> to have their characters be captured. Their recommendation is to talk to the players ahead of time if you really want to run a capture-and-escape, and make sure everyone is cool with the occasional GM-fiat capture.
