These are not historically accurate, for the most part, being depicted in places and times when there were no witch-hunts, or misrepresenting ones that did occur. In particular, one of the most famous episodes of witch-hunting, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials">Salem Witch Trials<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, featured <em>no</em> burnings at all.

Popular belief makes it out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>, saying that if the 'witch' floated, they'd pull her out and kill her. If the "witch" drowned, on the other hand... well, they were still dead, they just weren't a witch. Actually she would be tied to a rope: if she did float, they would pull her out, and the fact would be regarded as incriminating. (Of course sometimes they wouldn't do this quick enough, and she'd still drown. "Floating" could also be achieved by trickery with the ropes). If she sank, they would pull her out all the same, but cleared of charges. The ducking stool is an unrelated, non-lethal device of punishment where a woman was dunked in cold water for being a public nuisance of some sort.

<ul><li> <em>Code Geass</em> has this when a mystical trap causes Lelouch to see images of C.C.'s past, including multiple gruesome "deaths" — one of which was, of course, burning at the stake.

In her defense, Maphohetka may be innocent of whatever she was accused of (since the exact nature of Bizenghast's misfortune is never revealed) and the townspeople do actually verge on the "evil and bigoted" side (keeping up their witch lynching traditions well into the late 19th-early 20th century).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheTarotCafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheTarotCafe">The Tarot Cafe</a></em>, Pamela's mother (a midwife) was accused of witchcraft after the baby she was delivering and the child's mother both died. She confessed to witchcraft just so that she could plead for her daughter's safety and was burned at the stake. Pamela was later accused of witchcraft because she could see the future and because she rejected a creepy old priest's advances on her.

</li><li> The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who was a materialist and did not believe in witchcraft, nonetheless argued in his book <em>Leviathan</em> that witches were justly punished, as if <em>they</em> believed it, their attempts to harm people with magic were still criminal (apparently he felt all accusations were true), much like a person who tries to shoot somebody dead with a gun that turns out to be unloaded.

The White Council of Wizards' own approach to people who use black magic is completely in line with the older meaning: Their punishment for a first offense is usually decapitation, and ignorance of the laws of magic or having good motives is no excuse. It's possible to be spared, but only if another wizard speaks up for them, agrees to train them and ensure it never happens again, potentially at the cost of their own life if they do relapse.

She is the first woman he's ever met who loved him (back), but being a rather naive 16th century man, he doesn't dismiss the possibility of her being a witch until he witnesses the trial, which is a turning point for his life and he becomes more cynical. The trial itself plays this trope straight, although instead of the swim test, they use more conventional torture methods. And of course, she gets burned in the end, but only after "confessing" that her accomplice was the witch catcher who caught her. (Which causes a chain reaction as the witch catcher "confesses" that pretty much everyone he's had troubles with is an accomplice and a servant of Satan.)

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> games:
<ul><li> The majority of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> magic users end up in this manner. Unusually for this trope, many of the witches actually <em>are</em> in contact with malign supernatural beings. In one piece of background material a witch hunter burns a 6-year-old girl at the stake because her parents went to a mad scientist to heal her broken leg and ended up mutated as a result. The witch hunter got her drunk because he knew that she was an innocent who just had the misfortune to have the traveling doctor be an insane lunatic, but she couldn't be allowed to live because of the mutations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> is actually somewhat nuanced on the subject. There's a distinction between <em>psykers</em> and <em>witches</em>. Psykers have an innate connection with the warp. There's always a chance they could be possessed, but they can (provided that they're strong enough, and receive the proper training, and are lucky not to attract a dangerous demon, they can survive). <em>Witches</em>, on the other hand, are those who deliberately use rituals and spells to draw power form the warp, usually by making some pact with some malevolent warp entity or daemon. Also, inquisitors and witchhunters are very numerous and diverse. Some of them are diehard witch-burners, others are compromising pragmatists, others are severe radicals who will use witches for their own purposes. In fact, the Imperium needs psykers, Astropaths for communication and Navigators to guide starships through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">Warp</a>, and just about every branch of the Imperial military uses sanctioned psykers, there are even many Inquisitors who are psykers. While those who are too weak to use for those purposes can be fed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>. So, needless to say, a lot of Inquisitors try to take psykers who aren't involved with Chaos alive. If a witch is deemed dangerous enough however, they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">burn the whole planet</a> just to be safe. Outside of the Inquisition itself this distinction is almost completely unknown, and all psykers get lumped together as witches; the more sophisticated might avoid using the term for sanctioned psychers out of politeness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda">Necromunda</a></em> the religious fanatics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">House Cawdor</a> and members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Cult of Redemption</a> possess an intense loathing of psykers and Wyrds, believing that the best fate for such witches is immolation by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon">flamer weaponry</a>. During the 1st and 2nd Edition of the game Redemptionist Crusade even had a rule that they would automatically burn any Wyrd they capture at the stake unless their comrades could rescue them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> zigzags this trope. In general, practitioners of arcane magic are feared and shunned in all save a few of the most "enlightened" Domains, such as the comparatively high-magic land of Darkon, but people actually being dragged to the stake and burned by a lynch mob generally doesn't happen without a lot of provocation or unless you're in one of the more backwater regions. Played straight with the domain of Tepest, which is based on a combination of Witch Trials Salem and Grimm Fairy Tales — their Darklord is even a coven of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">hags</a> called the Sisters Mindefisk. Unusually, their ire is directed less at magic-users and more at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">fey</a>, whom they live in terror of; "witches" are people who are willingly in league with the fey, although they're so backwards that they can't identify that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> and so anyone who practices non-clerical magic is a "witch" in their eyes. Burning them is justified because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">malevolent inquisition</a> steadily amassing political power has its roots in the domain's worship of a sun god named Belenus. Tepest is regarded as one of the most backwards and primitive domains in the Demiplane of Dread.
<ul><li> Tepest features heavily in the 2nd edition module <em>Servants of Darkness</em>, which gives PCs the opportunity to derail this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">trope</a>, proving an accused woman's innocence by exposing the evil fey creature which is truly to blame for the misfortunes plaguing a Tepestani village. This is referenced in the 3e sourcebook covering the Tepest region, which reveals that the head of the Tepestani Inquisition was actually shaken so much that he has since tried to stamp down the anti-fey and anti-witch hysteria that his organization is building its power around.
</li></ul></li><li> The generic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> module "The Apocalypse Stone" has a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. The player characters come upon a town where they are about to "burn the witch". They must (to pass a test of character they don't know about, anyway) find out the truth about her guilt. At first it appears she is innocent, and the missing child she's accused of killing can be found elsewhere - but looking into it more carefully reveals that yes, she is still a witch who's into human sacrifice and worships a devil. Mind you, even if the burning takes place, the local good-aligned community leader intends to quickly strangle her under the cover of smoke instead, so that's another aspect that's subverted.
<ul><li> Played straight with the Order of Seropaenes from the sourcebook <em>Tome of Magic</em>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">binder</a> playable class standing in for the witch.
</li><li> Generally, though, most D&amp;D settings avert this under the rather understandable logic that witch-burning cannot be a 100% effective way of eliminating wizards before they achieve high-levels and, when that happens, the resultant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> will <em>not</em> look kindly on the people who spent his or her youth threatening him. Given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">high-level wizard</a> is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> whose powers range from "merely" incredibly destructive to absolutely nightmarish<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6yv0l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6yv0l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6yv0l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">conjurers, for example, can summon literal <em>armies</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a> who will happily kill you painfully and then subject your soul to eternal torment, whilst necromancers can subject you to all kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> fates on their own</span>, the population of witch-burners, and those willing to support witch-burners, would experience a very sudden, very <em>sharp</em>, decline.
<ul><li> This is even lampshaded in a couple of sourcebooks. For example, the backstory of Vecna, a half-fiend necromancer and demonologist who ascended to become first a lich and then a full-fledged god. One of the first things he did after mastering his powers was come back to the city where he was born, and from which he was exiled when they tried to burn him at the stake and only succeeded at killing his mother. He effortlessly slaughtered every last one of them, save for the city's leaders; them he spared because they had dared to offer their own lives in exchange for the lives of their citizens.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is the core concept of the party game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Werewolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Werewolf">Werewolf</a></em>. There are monsters hiding in the village and killing people at night, but you can't tell them from the innocent villagers by looking at them. What's the solution? Grab a pitchfork or a torch, form a lynch mob, and tie a rope to the old hanging tree.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning">Hunter: The Reckoning</a></em> implies repeatedly that the Salem and Inquisitorial witch hunts were both justified and effective. Of course, in the Old World of Darkness, that's not entirely ridiculous.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy">Fighting Fantasy</a></em> gamebook <em>Spellbreaker</em> contains a notable subversion in that the witch hunters are the <em>good guys</em>, fighting against an evil coven of witches and warlocks that are trying to free a powerful demon from its mystic prison. The reader can even encounter a supposed witch-burning, although the young woman about to be burned is actually innocent, and the warlock is actually the inquisitor who's about to burn her, having framed her as a way of throwing suspicion off himself.
</li><li> House Karanok in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> burns every arcane caster they can get their hands on. Presumably, they haven't yet gotten their hands on Elminster. Why? They still <em>exist</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns">Fading Suns</a></em> this used to be the Urth Orthodox Church's policy with psychics, but after the Eskatonic Order showed that their powers could fight the Symbiots the Church began to grudgingly accept "Penitent" psychics. Though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Temple Avesti</a> still likes to go on Witch Hunts, making them extremely unpopular among the populace, at least one Avestite has been burned at the stake for accusing a well-loved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Amalthean</a> healer of heresy.
</li><li> Being burned at the stake is mentioned to be the fate of most "witches" (read: people with supernatural powers) caught by either the Inquisition, after being tormented at its hands, or the people of certain countries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AnimaBeyondFantasy">Anima: Beyond Fantasy</a></em>. Since in that game spellcasting can be done even tied and/or gagged, presumably the chains and the like used to hold the victim would nullify their powers.

If Geralt saves her, the player later has to fight off most of the important villagers (while fighting a hell hound variant).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> An utterly bizarre example occurred with the death of the two last <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_auk">Great Auks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; apparently the last two individuals were killed because their capture occurred at the same time a storm came, leading the sailors to think the birds were witches.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the methods for dealing with suspected witches varied greatly between areas and eras:
<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">the Middle Ages proper</a> witchcraft wasn't a major crime — 'cunning folk' were practitioners of low-level magic that were generally not persecuted legally, unless they were accused of cheating their customers out of the supposed effects of the magic sold. Lethal magic was treated essentially as a subsection of poisoning, and punished accordingly with death, though not by burning, while lesser offenses could only lead to a fine or corporal punishment. Only with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">The Late Middle Ages</a> and the publication of the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalleusMaleficarum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalleusMaleficarum">Malleus</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum">Maleficarum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> did the mass witch hunts begin. Prior to this, the Church's position was largely that witches were not even real - or rather, that magic was not real, simply illusions of the Devil. The <em>Malleus</em> itself was banned when it came out as the heretical ravings of a lunatic, but unfortunately enthusiastic amateurs got a hold of it anyway, causing a boom among both Catholic and Protestant laymen.
</li><li> After the Reformation witch-hunts gained rapid popularity on both sides of the fence, as religious paranoia rose to ridiculous degrees. Most of the witch-trials were performed by secular courts or minor clergy with little idea how to perform any actual investigation, though in Protestant countries even higher levels of clergy sometimes got themselves involved. Martin Luther was recorded saying something to the effect of: "I would gladly burn them myself."
</li><li> In England and America, witches were usually simply hanged, and sometimes burned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">post mortem</a></em> to prevent them from coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">back as undead</a>. However, in continental Europe, burning alive was a very popular method of execution for witches and heretics alike — the distinction between the two was often narrow, to say the least. Not until Henry IV's statute "De Heretico Comburendo" was burning authorized in England as a punishment for heresy, and this sentence was rarely passed. Interestingly enough, getting convicted of witchcraft didn't mean an automatic death sentence. In England and Wales, the vast majority of those accused of witchcraft were pardoned. Apparently people liked a good trial, but couldn't be bothered to actually carry out the sentence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition">The Spanish Inquisition</a> actually refused to do this after the late-16th century, and even before then they were rather lax on witchcraft, very rarely ending in true executions. The Grand Inquisitor himself pronounced the tales of mass "sabbats" unlikely and unsupported by any evidence (it was considered much more credible that testimonies of people hosting Satanic meetings in the woods were probably just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookersAndBlow">lustful sinners celebrating regular orgies</a>, sometimes with the help of rudimentary party drugs), and stated that any person claiming to be a witch was either a liar or clinically insane. Even if declared witches, most accused actually survived with only "minor" torture and fairly small official punishment; execution itself was so rare that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">caused the few cases to be spectacularly publicized</a>, which probably contributed to the legend that the Inquisition was having its hands full on the witch-killing topic. The Inquisition was more concerned about Jews and Moors, in particular the remnant population of Muslims in Spain: Castile-Leon had only conquered Granada in 1492, so the region and its Muslim people were something of an ongoing problem for the Christian rulers until the last of them were ethnically cleansed in the early 17th century. That said, this probably didn't stop non-Royal and non-Church town authorities (i.e. about 2/3 of all towns) from holding witch trials and hanging 'witches', or angry mobs from doing likewise.
</li></ul></li><li> Sadly, the practice continues today in various African countries.
</li><li> In Iceland, from 1625-1683, 21 people were executed by burning after being accused of witchcraft (which could include just keeping magical talismans in their homes). All but one of these people were male, as men were believed to be the only people capable of being witches in Icelandic society. There's an interesting, albeit somewhat cheesy, museum dedicated to Icelandic witchcraft in the 17th century in the town of Hólmavík, in the West Fjords.
</li><li> A common misconception, even in Massachusetts, is that the victims of the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 were burned, when in fact, most were hanged, with the exception of Giles Corey, who was pressed to death (i.e., had a large board the size of a door laid on top of him and then rocks were piled onto the board, till he suffocated. He got special treatment because he refused to enter a plea and was found in contempt of court. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">He just told them to add more weight</a>). He was actually trying to spare his family the loss of his property, which would happen on a conviction of witchcraft (as was inevitable). Under common law, no trial could be held if the accused would not enter a plea. "Pressing" under heavy stones was the method used to force this out of one that refused to. Giles died, but he did so legally innocent and his family inherited his land.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Grandier">Urbain Grandier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a French Catholic priest in Loudun who was accused of a diabolical pact and causing a whole convent of nuns to become possessed. His case is notable in having inspired a book by Aldous Huxley (<em>The Devils of Loudun</em>), a film by Ken Russell (<em>The Devils</em>), and an opera by Krzysztof Penderecki (<em>Die Teufel von Loudun</em>).
</li><li> In Sweden, about 300 "witches" were burned between 1668 and 1676. Most of them admitted to having committed witchcraft, and were rewarded by being decapitated before the burning. The only one to be burned alive was Malin Matsdotter, to whom this was punishment for refusing to admit anything. Before she was burned alive, she noticed that one of her daughters (the one that had accused her) stood in the crowd and told her and everyone present that her daughter now belonged to the devil. She (reportedly) did not scream when she was burned. It was probably due to a sack of gunpowder being placed around her neck out of mercy. <br/><br/>The Swedish trials ended with the church, who had been against the trials from the beginning but forced to prosecute them due to the sheer number of accusations, declaring that all witches had forever been exorcised from Sweden. They then proceeded to publically torture and burn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">some of the accusers</a> (most of which where in their teens!) saying that they were the last remaining witches.
</li><li> In Germany, the trial of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappenheimer_family">Pappenheimer family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, considered to be <em>the worst witch trial</em> in German history. Don't read the article if you have a weak stomach. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The parents and the eldest sons were to be executed together with two other men. The bodies of the men were torn six times each with irons, Anna's breasts were cut off and rubbed in the faces of her adult sons, the skeletons of the men were broken on the wheel, the father was subjected to impalement on a pike, and finally, they were burned at the stake. </span>
</li><li> The Würzburg witch-trials. Over the course of six years, <em>nine hundred people</em> were burnt as witches in Germany, including many children, some as young as <em>four</em>.
</li><li> Translation:
<ul><li> Interestingly, the passage quoted at the top of this page, from the King James Version, is actually a rather iffy translation. The term "witch" is a more recent invention of the English language, and of course no particular method of execution was prescribed. The word used in the original language roughly translates to "sorceress" with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">one who twists the minds of others</a> for personal gain" connotations. Though rulers who served God often stamped out <em>all</em> practitioners; this is why Saul had trouble finding one when he decided to actually consult one.
</li><li> Another translation renders the word as <em>prostitute</em>. Sacred prostitutes often served the god(desse)s of the nations opposing Israel. They were seen as trying to tempt God's people away from him. Some may have practiced sacred rites.
</li><li> It's also possible that the original word was <em>poisoner</em>, as there was overlap between the Greek and Latin words for "poisoner" and "witch"; King James was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">rather obsessed with witchcraft</a>, which may have influenced the translation.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the first recorded convictions of witchcraft in Europe occurred in Ireland in 1324 and involved <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Kyteler">Alice Kyteler<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a wealthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWitch">four-time widow</a> accused by the local bishop and gossips of poisoning her former husbands for their estates, sacrificing animals to demons, heresy, sorcery and having sex with an incubus. In reality, she was probably only guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">moneylending</a>, which piss-poor Middle Ages folk would have deeply resented. Something of an aversion, in that it was Kyteler's servant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">Jack Bauer'd</a> into giving a possibly false confession, who was burned at the stake, while Kyteler herself fled to Europe and promptly disappeared from history. Her former house, in which authorities allegedly found such items as "body parts of an unbaptized infant; evil powders; communion wafers imprinted with satanic images; the fingernails and toenails of corpses boiled in the skull of a robber; candles made of human fat", is now a popular local pub.

</li><li> In Denmark, a holiday based around the history of burning witches (St John's Eve) has been a tradition. Of course, no real person is used, but a scarecrow-like-doll that looks like a stereotypical witch is burned instead. It's also more like a bonfire with a doll stuck in it.
</li><li> A similar folk tradition exists in the Czech Republic, on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walpurgisnacht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walpurgisnacht">Walpurgis Night</a> (30th of April).
