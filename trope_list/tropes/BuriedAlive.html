Nope. He's got something far worse planned: he's going to bury the hero. Alive.
</p><p>Sometimes, he'll tie the hero up before dumping him/her in the coffin. If the villain's a sporting sort of fellow, he'll provide a flashlight or an air canister. If he's even more sadistic than usual, he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigYourOwnGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigYourOwnGrave">force them to dig the hole themselves</a>. Regardless, the villain is going to kill the hero in one of the most appalling ways imaginable.
</p><p>There's a wide range of reasons a bad guy does this. He might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">righteously angry at the hero</a> and is intent on making him suffer for past misdeeds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">("37 years ago you stole my Froot Loops at recess. Now, it's payback time!")</a> It could be a matter of security; there's no murder weapon and you don't have to worry about disposing of the body, since, hey, you just did. Often, however, it's just a matter of the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">being a sadistic prick.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Of course, as with most forms of killing the hero that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">favor cruelty over efficiency</a>, the hero manages to dig their way out, or a sidekick will pop out of the bushes and dig him up the moment the villain leaves.
</p><p>Heroes generally don't do this, even to bad guys. It's a pretty awful thing to do to another human being, no matter how evil they are. The exception to that comes when the hero blows up an ancient building or tomb while the villain remains inside. If the bad guy survives the blast and falling debris, he is technically buried alive. Usually this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> situation. Another exception is when the villain has already done the same kind of thing to the hero or one of his friends, in which case it can be a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>.
</p><p>Very popular because it really does touch on something that just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear">creeps the living hell out of people</a>. Claustrophobia is widespread, and the specific fear of being buried alive is just slightly less so.

In the days before modern medicine, it would happen accidentally when the doctors made a mistake about whether someone was really dead.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandNecktie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandNecktie">Sand Necktie</a>, where a character is buried vertically up to their neck, with the intention of death from the incoming tide, dehydration, or nasty animal-related death.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a> stories:
<ul><li> "Jury Duty!" (<em>Crime SuspenStories</em> #6) is a tale of a man who was hanged and declared dead. The twist was that his neck was broken but his spinal cord was not severed — so he was still very much alive. He went on to be a complete bastard to the town that had punished him, because it was impossible to prosecute a legally dead man for any crime. However, some of his enemies decided to use that loophole to their advantage as well, because there is nothing in the world wrong with <em>burying</em> a dead man, either....
</li><li> "Chatter-Boxed!" (<em>The Haunt of Fear</em> #15), a story set in December 1941, features an elderly man who suffers from catalepsy, making him appear dead when he isn't. He leaves instructions to be buried with a telephone, allowing him to call for help lest he regain consciousness. Sure enough, he is buried after having an episode behind the wheel and does exactly that, only to find every phone line tied. After futilely trying to get a call through and finally running out of oxygen, the operator angrily snaps at the man's blue-faced corpse for being ignorant of what's just taken place: the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
</li><li> "The Thing From The Grave" (<em>Tales From the Crypt</em> #22) has this occur when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> forms between a woman and two men, ostensibly all friends.

There was a plague epidemic going on in that prison, and the escaper counted on the burial detail being in too big a hurry for little details like nailing the coffin lid tightly or shoveling very much dirt on top.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> book <em>Killer Profile</em> mentions a serial killer whose MO was burying his victims in homemade coffins, which had pipes leading to the surface, so they could breathe. The guy also enjoyed giving his victims false hope by leaving them with a bit of water and hammer they could try and escape with.

The story then flashes between the present and to several weeks earlier, showing how she came to this fate and leaving the reader to decipher who her would-be killer is, all the while inserting her frantic efforts to remain conscious until help arrives, which it does at the last minute.
</li><li> Dutch novel <em>The Golden Egg</em> has a girl undergo this treatment when travelling Europe. Her boyfriend spends the rest of the novel trying to find out where she is until at the end he meets his girlfriend's killer, and says he'd do anything to find out what happens to her.

Because it was a serious concern at the time, coffins were rigged with bells and escape latches and such which would pop open if the person moved around inside the coffin. They fake a dead body and have the coffin open on the platform, grossing out the police inspector who otherwise would have searched it and found the hidden man.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StephaniePlum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StephaniePlum">Stephanie Plum</a></em> book, Stephanie is trapped in a coffin by the bad guy.

At the highest understanding of the Oracle, a Sin-Eater can effectively wander freely as long as they want; the corebook makes reference to an urban legend amongst the Bound about a Mafioso who was buried in wet cement while knocked unconscious and has been using the Oracle for <em>decades</em> to keep his body in suspended animation.

<ul><li> This was a very real fear in the 18th and 19th centuries. Back in those days, most civilizations had unreliable ways to identify death, and so stories of the recently buried screaming for help were not uncommon. We can't know how often people were in fact buried alive, but the sheer horrific quality of being buried prematurely led to the creation of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_coffin">Safety coffins,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which were essentially coffins with a bell or flag stuck above ground to give the recently buried a method of communication with the outside. One of these can be seen in the movie <em>The First Great Train Robbery</em>.
<ul><li> Mary Roach's <em>Stiff</em> includes a section on live burial, the bizarre methods doctors once used to try to distinguish death from mere unconsciousness (e.g. an automatic tongue-pulling device!), and so on. She notes that the "coffin bells" never once saved a person who'd been prematurely buried, although some were disinterred when the corpse's decomposition caused its weight to shift and sound a false alarm.
<ul><li> Similarly, fears of accidental live burial in German-speaking countries led to the creation of "waiting mortuaries", where corpses were kept above ground until they showed clear signs of decomposition. Again, there is no recorded case of a person actually reviving in one.
</li></ul></li><li> These days, accidental live burial would only be possible if the person's body was neither autopsied nor embalmed. In most jurisdictions, one if not both procedures are required by law for the majority of human burials. If you were unlucky enough to get to the mortician or the coroner while still alive, the autopsy and/or embalming process will definitely kill you (or wake you up) before you are buried.
<ul><li> In most US jurisdictions, neither embalming nor an autopsy are required for the majority of human burials. Only about 20% of US deaths are even subject to investigation by coroners or medical examiners. Of those, less than 25% are subject to autopsy. State laws and FTC rules prohibit the requiring of embalming. The FTC rule says, "Except in certain special cases, embalming is not required by law." A "special case" would include a funeral with viewing .

Thankfully, everyone escaped.
</li><li> On his deathbed, George Washington requested that his body be kept unburied for two days to make sure he was actually dead. This is actually <em>still</em> common practice in the form of the wake. A wake, for those who do not know, was when the family and friends of the deceased would place the corpse, in the coffin, in a prominent place in their home. The said family and friends would then sit up with the dead in case they woke up. This was done for 1 to 2 days before burial.

</li><li> Subverted with Anthony Spilotro, on whom the character of Nicky Santoro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casino">Casino</a></em> was based (see the entry in Film above), and his brother Michael. While sand was allegedly found in their lungs, indicating live burial, it was confirmed years later that they had been murdered in a basement before being buried in the cornfield.
</li><li> In an interview, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> said that her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">boggart</a> would be her being buried alive.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>, supposedly the punishment for a Vestal Virgin that had broken her vow of chastity was being walled up in a crypt and left to die. This was because it was forbidden to spill the blood of a Vestal Virgin. Why they didn't just strangle them is their own secret. However, it was also used a kind of trial: they were left with a small amount of bread and water so that the goddess Vesta could save them if they were truly innocent. <br/><br/>In fact, one version of the story of Romulus and Remus claims that their mother was a Vestal Virgin seduced by Mars, and she was sentenced to this fate by her uncle, who also orders the death of the twins by exposure. Both means would avoid his direct blood-guilt, but her sons are luckier; the servant tasked with killing them can't bring himself to do so, and leaves them by the banks of the Thebes, where they are found by Lupa.
</li><li> And British statesman Lord Chesterfield wrote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LettersToHisSon">Letters to His Son</a></em>: "All I desire for my own burial is not to be buried alive; but how or where, I think must be entirely indifferent to every rational creature." (letter 311)
</li><li> In the First World War, the sheer ferocity of the artillery barrages was sufficient to dislodge large enough volumes of earth to cover over some of those it did not blow apart. Fortunately for quite a few soldiers thus buried, trench warfare being what it was meant that there was always an immediate and plentiful supply of willing hands to dig you out and shovels with which they could do so. Some people survived this treatment more than once.
</li><li> Then there was the underground war, where (predominantly but not exclusively) British and German diggers tunneled under the battlefield to lay explosive charges and undermine each other's trenches. This sort of warfare was slow, laborious and terrifying, especially when Your Tunnel met Their Tunnel very suddenly.
</li><li> During the first Gulf War, US tanks equipped with plows were used to fill in trenches manned by Iraqi soldiers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">rather than send in soldiers to clear the trenches with hand-to-hand fighting</a>.
</li><li> This was a common punishment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">for women</a> in Medieval Sweden, usually for theft. Men were hanged instead. The reason for this was because women might kick and thrash about with their legs when hanged, and then onlookers might get to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">see something inappropriate.</a> This type of punishment was called "Kvick I Jord" which literally means "(Lying) Conscious In The Earth".
</li><li> Prairie dogs, gopher-like colonial rodents of the North American plains, have been known to fight back against burrowing predators such as black-footed ferrets by filling up the carnivores' tunnel entrances when they're sleeping or suckling young underground. The predator can normally dig itself out again, but wastes time and energy doing so while the prairie dogs can forage in safety.
</li><li> According to the Roman historian Tacitus, this was the punishment for men caught having sex with other men among the German tribes. <em>Literally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">burying your gays</a>...
</li><li> A not very common, but not exactly unheard way to execute Christians, whose victims included: Saint Daria (apparently a former Vestal priestess) and her husband Saint Chrisanthus, Saint Paulina and her mother Saint Candida, Saint Irene of Egypt and her brother Saint Athanasius, Blessed Maria Dolorosa van Brabant, Saint Andronik of Perm, <a class="urllink" href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Elizabeth_the_New_Martyr">Saint Elizabeth of Russia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the latter, in fact, was thrown into an open mineshaft together with several other people and then they were blown up with grenades), etc.
</li><li> The brothers and Sikh martyrs Sahibzada Fateh Singh and Sahibzada Zorawar Singh were two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">kids under 10</a> condemned to be bricked up alive inside a wall for not converting from Sikhism to Islam, during the persecutions of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In a subversion, the boys' executioners entombed them up to their shoulders and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">beheaded them</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">presumably out of pity.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailydisruption.com/dublin-man-buries-himself-alive-live-streams-from-the-grave/7686">Dublin man buries himself alive, live-streams from the "grave"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In the 1995 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampoong_Department_Store_collapse">Sampoong Department Store disaster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in South Korea, large portions of the building collapsed into the store's multiple basement levels, trapping anyone who had been in those levels under massive amounts of rubble. Several were found alive, a few after more than a week, with the last survivor being pulled from the wreckage an astonishing 17 days after the collapse. Evidence also suggested that others had survived the initial catastrophe, but died before they could be rescued.
</li><li> In 1977, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Einhorn">Holly Maddux<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> disappeared after returning to her abusive ex-boyfriend's apartment to collect her things. 1.5 years later, her remains were found stuffed in a trunk which was itself stuffed in the back of his closet. The position of her body—arms outstretched—indicated that despite the severe bludgeoning he administered, she was still alive when he placed her in the trunk and died trying to get out.
</li><li> In 1964, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Chaney,_Goodman,_and_Schwerner">three civil rights workers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> disappeared in Mississippi. When their bodies were discovered in an earthen dam several weeks later, one of they had clay in his lungs and clenched in his fists, indicating that he was still alive when placed in his grave.
</li><li> In 2013, 29-year old ship's cook Harrison Odjegba Okene survived a maritime version of this trope when the tugboat on which he was serving capsized and sank off the coast of Nigeria. With his ship resting on the floor of the Atlantic ocean, Okene survived for more than 60 hours in a small air pocket that had somehow not been filled with water, with a bottle of Coke as his only source of food or hydration until he was discovered by divers who had been sent to the ship on a salvage operation. Sadly, the 11 other men on board on the ship were not so fortunate.
</li><li> Following the Battle of Guandu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Cao Cao</a> took many of Yuan Shao's soldiers prisoner. When he learned a number of them tried to escape to rejoin Yuan, Cao had them buried alive as punishment, as well as a warning to the other prisoners.
