<h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Lawyers</a></h2>
Since they're trained to defend anyone, even if their client is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">obviously guilty</a> (or to prosecute anyone, even if the defendant is blatantly innocent), lawyers are often labelled as prolific, greedy liars who will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">find even the most vague of loopholes</a> in the law to get a good verdict. While there are, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">positive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">portrayals</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">in media</a>, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a></em>, they are still normally villains by default, and the source of many morality-based jokes. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">Evil Lawyer Joke</a>. It also doesn't help that the media is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a> stories. Usually defense attorneys or corporate lawyers get the brunt of this, but even prosecutors and other less prominent examples will get this treatment, with the former often portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">zealots obsessed with "purging" all traces of criminality everywhere</a> and the latter as literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyers</a>. The fact that any evil lawyer defending a guilty client or prosecuting an innocent is always paired against another lawyer trying to do the inverse seems to go over everyone's heads.

Who is referred to by Hammond as "the blood sucking lawyer".

<ul><li> The Nac Mac Feegle carry swords that glow in the presence of lawyers, much as elvish swords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> glow in the presence of orcs.

</li><li> Mr. Slant, a centuries old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Zombie</a> who is undisputed Head of the Guild of Lawyers, is presented as the amoral type to whom the letter of the Law means everything and the <em>spirit</em> of the Law is mere circumstantial evidence. It is said his reason for coming back as a Zombie was so as to be able to claim outstanding fees from errant clients. He has been seen providing the legal groundwork for a coup d'etat, so as to ensure the takeover is legally unimpeachable; but capable of unhesitatingly switching sides to defend the status quo when the revolution fails.

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></em> gives us everything from the nice ones (like Rumpole) to mercenary jerks.
<ul><li> Rumpole may be one of the nice ones, but he is often pretty underhanded. If he ever went on the prosecution, he would be a monster. Fortunately, Rumpole only defends.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0arue');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0arue" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0arue');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except for that one time...except it was a private prosecution, and he resigned that when it turned out that the whole thing was a scheme.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits">Suits</a></em> is a positive portrayal of lawyers and what they do. Or maybe it's not always so positive. The <em>protagonists</em> are lawyers and while the audience is presumably supposed to be on their side, they're not always <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">nice</a></em> (and they're certainly not always legally in the right; sometimes whether they're even <em>morally</em> in the right is questionable). Of course, the <em>antagonists</em> are often lawyers too, and to keep the audience's sympathy with the protagonists, their opponent will generally be depicted as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a> or at best as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. Louis Litt was an antagonist to start with, but later seasons have shown that he's not really a bad guy, he just cares more about the reputation of himself, his firm, and his profession than he cares about social niceties or politeness, so he's a bit of an ogre to anyone he thinks isn't performing up to an extremely high standard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A. Law</a></em> saw a similar distribution.
</li><li> Averted when it comes to state prosecutors, which, thanks to shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, are practically seen as heroes.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> is often seen as the first subversion to an even older image. <em>Perry Mason</em> depicted poor, ineffectual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Hamilton Burger</a> who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> at best and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>, always eager to send people to the gas chamber at absolute worst.
</li><li> Most of the defense attorneys get a fair shake as well, because at <em>worst</em> they're seen doing their best for their client, and at best they can be seen objecting to overzealous prosecution or taking the case because they believe that some Constitutional rights (usually Free Speech) are being infringed upon.
<ul><li> Prosecuting attorneys have been getting more and more of a bad rap as of late and are now frequently portrayed as amoral, sociopathic crooks who care more about their own perceived effectiveness and less about playing by the rules, which leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheEvidence">the withholding of evidence harmful to their case</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">fabrication of helpful evidence</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryAndWitnessTampering">witness coercion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheEvidence">the "loss" of crucial paperwork</a>, and, if they're <em>really</em> nasty, backroom deals with judges and jurors.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, where the military lawyers are the really good and honorable guys.
<ul><li> However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> played this trope majorly straight in season seven with M. Alison Hart, whom the fen nicknamed "Bitchy McLawyer" because her only real purpose on the show was to use her legal services to hinder the team's investigations wherever possible. And she had serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">BST</a> with Gibbs.
<ul><li> The depiction of lawyers in <em>NCIS</em> is even more funny, because usually, if a client goes so far as to request a lawyer's assistance against the very often unfair and unprofessional treatment by the agents, these lawyers are mostly ineffective, even though some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">try to</a> depict traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">evil lawyers</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> pilot, which shows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> 21st century, where the society got rid of all lawyers. Of course, the so-called "court of facts" is, in fact, nothing more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>, where the accused are already assumed to be guilty and must prove their innocence with hard evidence.
<ul><li> Also, in <em>Measure of a Man</em>, Picard butts heads with a Starfleet JAG because he feels she showed excess zeal during his court martial. This largely amounts to being Picard's bias as she's shown to be perfectly reasonable during the proceedings against Data. (Although the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheLostEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheLostEra">Star Trek: The Lost Era</a></em> novel <em>The Buried Age</em> shows that he was right about the court martial  it also has her superior at that court martial having to remind her that it's not the 20th century, and their goal is to find the truth, not win at all costs. Apparently, it's a lesson she's learnt since.)

</li><li> 'Get Over It' by The Eagles has the lyric "Let's kill all the lawyers. Kill them tonight".
<ul><li> Which, of course, is a paraphrase of a quote from <em>Henry VI</em> by William Shakespeare.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Theatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Theatre">Theatre</a></span>
</p><ul><li> The (in)famous "Let's kill all the lawyers." line from <em>Henry VI, Part 2</em>. Sometimes mistaken for a subversion  (the line is spoken by a follower of the unsympathetic rebel)  but is in fact the punchline of an extended joke about the "perfect" society: free food, free clothes, free beer, and NO LAWYERS!
<ul><li> Followed by a more sober reflection on the evils of law without conscience:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings: but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since."

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a></em> has this as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>  in one later level, the player has to get a group of bad people into heaven. If the player uses the magnifying glass to identify which objects they are, they will find out that one of them is a lawyer.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series inverts this with prosecutors, who by and large care more about getting a guilty verdict and maintaining a perfect record than actually finding the guilty party. In "Justice for All", Phoenix considers all prosecutors to be this way without exception, and bitterly complains about how the prosecutors persist even though they know they're not in the right, making it more difficult for him to defend his clients. It helps that you play as the defense attorney, and your clients <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(except for Matt Engarde)</span> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLawyersGoodClients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLawyersGoodClients">always innocent</a>.
<ul><li> Though a lot of Phoenix's bad attitude towards prosecutors in the second game is related more to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edgeworth's disappearance at the end of the first game, which Phoenix considered a personal betrayal</span> than any actual antagonism towards the profession. He doesn't express any such thoughts in the first game or the ones after <em>Justice For All</em>.

<h2>Accountants</h2>
If you see an accountant in fiction, chances are they're dull, boring, and completely structured, being unable to relax or think outside the box. Many a story begins with an accountant discontent with their career and wanting to break out of the humdrum of cubicle life. If male, they're prime fodder for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a>. It seems the only accounts who <em>enjoy</em> their jobs are the ones scheming with their employer to help circumvent income tax laws or cover up illegal financial activities. They may or may not also be predators looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Nouveau Riche</a> individuals who suddenly need to manage large amounts of money, or elderly estate-holders who might be less able to keep track of their assets, with the intent of funneling money from them. Closely related jobs are not exempt: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">Auditors and Tax Collectors are unnervingly strict, heartless and unforgiving</a>. The reason this perception is so pervasive is because fiction writers are bound by their own biases; to someone who makes their living with their creativity, the idea of working in a cubicle crunching numbers all day would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.

</p><ul><li> Harold Crick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangerThanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangerThanFiction">Stranger Than Fiction</a></em> is a tax worker who is definitely dull, boring, and completely structured, but <em>not</em> heartless, and is in fact portrayed as a good man.

</li><li> He is also banking on the fact that "Hong Kong would never extradite [a Chinese national]". Batman doesn't recognize national sovereignty and the hurdles of due process.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Counsellor:</strong> Yes, but you see, Mr. Anchovy, your report here says that you are an extremely dull person.

Bankers have always generally been portrayed as greedy and amoral, believing they can always get their way if they throw enough money at the problem (and it will rarely be their money they're throwing).

This is done very rarely because they allow to decrease debts, but some works outright like to mock them for helping corrupt people that deserve to pay high debts. Of course, in works where those people are mocked, the debt collectors are usually portrayed as sympathetic, hardworking, and fair men.

Their job is to sell property, no matter how run-down or decrepit that property is, so naturally, they'll be accused of being liars in the media. It doesn't help that, in the UK at least, they are almost completely unregulated, and any crook can become one. A consumer watchdog set up an estate agency in central London with £143 and some fake properties and THAT WAS IT. In the US, it's far more heavily regulated, but there are plenty who seriously test those rules. While there are lots of honest agents who obey both the letter and spirit of the law, there are plenty of sleazeballs who will do just about anything that they think they can get away with just to get some extra cash in their pocket.

<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> - HR are responsible for vetting job applications, usually without any knowledge of what skills are needed to do that job. So they tend to be responsible for stopping you from getting a job you could do in your sleep, hiring obvious morons, or firing the best worker in the department for some imaginary infraction. And they're never on your side; any offer they make to help you is all just to make corporate happy about being covered against lawsuits and potentially finding a way to drop some cubiclelander who isn't thrilled about being crammed into a chair for eight hours a day to do pointless work for insulting pay while surrounded by assholes. An observation runs "People who can do the job, do the job. People who are otherwise unemployable end up working in Human Resources."
<p></p><h2>Salespersons</h2>
Paradoxically, this group is highly inclusive (in that it accepts people of any race, creed, gender, etc.) while it is still portrayed as being somewhat elitist ("If you're not in sales, you're in overhead"). The basic stereotype assumes that every member of this department will try to sell their company's product or service to anyone, regardless of whether or not the client-to-be has any need for the product (such as the proverbial "selling a refrigerator to Eskimos") and will not take "No" for an answer. As far as everyone else is concerned, the sales department is a den of iniquity staffed with inveterate liars with absolutely zero integrity who will say anything to anyone if they think it'll get them a sale, and no matter how many lies they tell and how many impossible promises they make, the only way that they'll have to face actual consequences instead of getting a slap on the wrist or being able to throw someone else under the bus is if they do something that could potentially get the company sued.
<p></p><h2>Architects</h2>
<p>While they tend to receive a generally positive portrayal, they are one of the first stops when choosing to a pretentious, artsy professional; the opposite of the stereotypical engineer, in essence.

</p><ul><li> American architects have brought some of this on themselves, by lobbying and self-regulating for decades to put as much legal responsibility as possible on their consulting engineers. Within the construction industry they definitely have the reputation as artsy can't-do-math types. Things are somewhat better in Europe, where architects are more likely to have some extensive structural engineering knowledge.
<ul><li> Also there is the saying "An architect is someone who is too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">gay</a> for Engineering, but too straight for Fashion Design".
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Graphic Designers</h2>
<p>Pretty much the same boat as architects, with the occasional added conviction that it's "not a <em>real</em> job".

With the exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers">Mario</a> (whose profession is rarely mentioned), plumbers in media are dumb rednecks with poor hygiene. Who have never heard of a belt... or long shirts.
<ul><li> Or/and are like other tradesmen (electricians, builders... ) portrayed as rip-off merchants always willing to overcharge or use delaying tactics ("Oh, we haven't got that part in stock, it will take a few days") to bump up the costs if they are being paid by the hour. Not to mention to charge an arm and a leg for what looks like a very simple repair.
</li><li> In the Swedish movie <em>Drömkåken</em> ("The Dream House"), the protagonist is at one point bullied by a whole crew of craftsmen who insult him, tear out a large part of the floor, and spend their worktime (which they expect to be paid for by the hour) talking on the phone. When the protagonist mentions that he may have difficulties paying for everything due to losing his job, they immediately walk out... and stick him with the bill for their unfinished work. He later fixes up the whole house (including the busted floor) with only some help and motivation from a friend, implying that the craftsmen were deliberately exaggerating the situation.
</li><li> Two auto mechanics try to stiff Stanley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em>, making him sign an unpriced bill and making a bet on whether they can trick him into paying for an imaginary engine part <em>while he's in earshot</em>. They later get their humiliating comeuppance by the Mask. (A similar situation appears in the original, much more violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMask">comic</a>, although the mechanics ended up brutally killed instead.)
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Truck Drivers</h2>
Often portrayed as unintelligent, crude, and untrustworthy. Occasionally, they are also perverts and/or womanizers. When they're not perverts, they only have paid sex, having a family or not.
<p></p><h2>Construction Workers</h2>
Like plumbers, portrayed as ignorant idiots with the added aspect of wolf whistling, catcalling, and making lewd sexual comments towards vulnerable or shy women in the street below where they are working on scaffolding where they are out of the way of any repercussions.

At least in the United States, anybody who works at McDonald's, Burger King, or some other fast-food chain is destined to be illiterate, unintelligent, and/or a stoner. "Flipping burgers at McDonald's for minimum wage" is used as a cautionary tale of what might happen if one doesn't at least finish high-school. Also, it is frowned upon to date someone who holds this type of job.

They suffer a lot, but to a lesser extent than workers of the fast food outlets. Depending on the type of retail, they are either respectable people or are illiterate illegal immigrants and mentally disabled who'll never get anywhere in life.
<ul><li> To many, <strong>Managers of Retail Stores and fast food chains</strong>. Horror stories of managers and bosses exploiting people such as forcing people to clock out, then clock <em>back in</em> for another consecutive shift without getting a break or forcing others to come in on their one day off to cover for an absentee worker, sexually extorting employees via threats of dismissal or (for illegal immigrants) deportation, or firing good workers to avoid having to pay for benefits abound, making this somewhat justified...even if a bit cruel since not every manager or boss is like that.
</li><li> Convenience Store Clerks usually end up getting the worst sides of both general retail and fast-food as well as frequently dealing with people in a rush. However, it's common that they don't have the luxury of passing the customer off on a manager, nor the authority to bend/break rules in the customer's favor, as they're usually the only one there. If that convenience store also sells gas (especially in the U.S.) then they also become the sole human face for the entire oil industry, thus having the pleasure of dealing with every customer that has an axe to grind over the cost of fuel.

Frequently portrayed as dimwitted, thuggish assholes who refuse to let people in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and who seem to be concerned with starting fights instead of preventing them just so they can have an excuse to beat someone half to death. Also expect them to randomly harass rule-abiding patrons minding their own business, leer at and sexually harass women, and ignore bad situations that are unfolding until they've grown out of control, which always results in someone getting seriously hurt. Particularly unsympathetic examples are frequently drugged-out, racist, or on the take from various criminal organizations, if not outright part of them. If there are good, honest bouncers working at an establishment as well, you can expect the bad ones to try and either corrupt them or force them out if they won't bend.

<p></p><h2>Actors &amp; Actresses, as well as any other kind of celebrity</h2>
Always shown as living by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>, also hated for having nearly <em>every</em> aspect of their life. Often shown as being a complete doofus subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> and being targeted by "Sleazy Tabloids". (examples: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>, and Jade Goody, at least before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">she died of cancer</a>)
<ul><li> Celebrities are often hated for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">tendency to choke news networks</a> upon deaths. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> and OJ Simpson, for example, developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">hatedoms</a> merely <em>because</em> people were so sick of turning on the TV and finding nothing but <em>more</em> news on their death or trial.
<ul><li> They're also hated by people who lost loved ones to similar causes that weren't taken seriously because no-one famous had died from it yet.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there are the actors/actresses that aren't famous. When they aren't portrayed like wanna-be celebrities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingForABreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaitingForABreak">Waiting for a Break</a>, they're usually shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Starving Artists</a> and weirdos that can break into random monologue at any moment.
</li><li> In Renaissance Times, acting, at worst, was a step or two above prostitution. This view even persisted from the 1600s up until the late 19th-early 20th century, generally due to the Puritans and their views of anything filled with frivolity and fun, or which glamorized dishonesty (since pretending to be someone else, or telling fictional stories, is a form of lying) as a horrible sin. This idea had consequences ranging from the banning of Maypoles and other light-hearted festivals to the picketing and boycotting of theaters and the refusal by English rulers to authorize or endorse playwrights.
<ul><li> This also carried on across the pond thanks to the belief in the American dream and "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps", and the fact that being paid to act, dance, and sing not only appeared like laziness but was generally not a very good way of making a living (see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Starving Artist</a>). This view showed up a great deal in literature of the time; prominent examples would be Theodore Dreiser's <em>Sister Carrie</em> and Paul Laurence Dunbar's <em>The Sport of the Gods</em>, as well as the Willa Cather short story, "A Gold Slipper".
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>'s musicalization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFrogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFrogs">The Frogs</a></em>, the opening "Invocation" addresses the gods as "You who look down on actors (and who doesn't?)"
</li><li> Many seem incapable of forming a loving long-term relationship and just marry whomever's young, hot and available. If the relationship hits a snag, they'll just trade their spouse for someone better.
</li><li> There's been a rising trend in the number of male celebrities from the 1970s who have been exposed or at least accused of sexual abuse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais">Ricky Gervais</a> once joked that anyone on TV in the 70s should just save the police the effort and turn themselves in.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Artists</h2>
Mainly of the screen-painting or sculpting kind, are usually viewed by people as spaced-out loons, obnoxious egomaniacs or lazy people who can't get better jobs for a living, despite most of these (especially sculptors) give months of their hard work into a single picture.
<ul><li> Modern abstract artists of the Tracey Emin or Damien Hirst type come in for a lot of derision and ridicule. Tracey Emin is best known for entering a representation of her unmade bed and personal living space into an exhibition as a "statement", and her rather abrasive, confrontational personality has attracted parody and sly sniggering. Damien Hirst's best-known work is a laterally dissected dead cow in a tank of formaldehyde. A regular cartoon strip in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye">Private Eye</a></em> is called "Young British Artists" and mercilessly pillories the attitudes and output of these Young Turks.
<ul><li> The art-collectors who esteem this sort of work and pay eye-watering sums for it also come in for flak. Charles Saatchi, a champion of Hirst and Emin, attracted a lot of laughter when he bought Marc Quinn's self-portrait bust, cast in his own blood, only to lose it when a cleaner unplugged the freezer that was keeping the precious work frozen, in order to plug in her hoover. The blood statue defrosted and melted. When the warehouse, in which Saatchi was storing his treasures of Modern British Art, caught fire and burnt down, the general opinion was that the quality of British art had leapt upwards overnight.
</li><li> Not that the dead artists don't have any haters. Living musicians also have their share of hatedom, see the Actors &amp; Actresses section below.
</li></ul></li><li> Animators get it pretty bad too thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a>. People tend to view them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Man Children</a> because they work on shows and movies for little kids while most normal people would've outgrown liking that stuff by now. Like the artist they can spend countless hours of work for only a couple of minutes of animation yet most of the public at large assumes that "drawing cartoons" is something a kid can do. There's also elements of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">Basement-Dweller</a> since an animator could spend days working at his station without seeing sunlight as well as sharing similar nerdy tendencies.
<ul><li> If you're an overseas animator, chances are you'll be seen as a technically proficient yet creatively void worker drone who's only purpose is to mimic the style of the show you're commissioned to work on. There's a reason why US animation studios send all their inbetweening work overseas.
</li><li> Logo animators avert this, since its in general considered to be important for business to make a logo. Not to mention all the social contacts you have with that business. In general most animators can detract people by mentioning all the company logo's they created.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Writers</h2>
Writers also get their share of ridicule. Unless you're a million-selling hit, good luck finding respect from the masses. Even worse if you're an aspiring writer, as the fact that you're not even published is taken as a sign, in and of itself, that your work must suck (never mind that even good novels can take YEARS to get published for a variety of reasons having little to nothing to do with the work itself). It's very common for aspiring writers to be told to give up their silly "hobby" and get a "real job."
<ul><li> Writers have the additional handicap of working in a medium which does not produce fast reactions in the way that music or paintings do. It's more difficult to convince a naysayer to take the time and effort to read your work as opposed to looking at a picture or listening to a few minutes of music.
</li><li> It's even worse if you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPublishing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPublishing">self-published</a> as many people will assume that your work was too poor to get published by a company and you have to sell it on Amazon. Never mind that sending in a manuscript means that you could be waiting months or even a year for a response that may be a rejection and self-publishing guarantees a substantially greater sum of royalties (70% compared to 15%). This stereotype is still persisting despite best-selling authors like John Locke and Hugh Howey (Whose series is being turned into a film by Ridley Scott) and published authors who have made more online than through print.
<ul><li> "I've got a terrific idea for a book. I'll tell it to you, you write it, and we'll split the money!"
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Ballet dancers</h2>
Male ballet dancers are almost always presented as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a>, sissy, weak men who are doing a "gender inappropriate" role. If they are straight, they are always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">effeminate</a>. Never mind that ballet is one of the most intense physical workouts the human body can experience, these guys are <em>wusses</em>. Recently, however, they're sometimes portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">Camp Straight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">Real Men Wear Pink</a>. They are <em>very</em> strong, lifting adult women (the female ballet dancers) over their heads for hours at a time, and <em>will</em> crush your hands in a firm handshake using his own, moisturized, silky-smooth hands if you decide to mock him or his profession.
<p>Female ballerinas don't get off much better. Often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking">chain-smoking</a> epitome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">Beauty Is Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean">Lean and Mean</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">French Jerk</a> (even though she's frequently Russian). The requisite dainty figure and young retirement age also seems to imply that even the most serious performer is just the plaything of fetishistic men (and only men of course, female creepy "admirers" get a pass no matter what).
</p><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film">Film</a></span>
</p><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan">Black Swan</a></em>, Nina, a ballet dancer, is obsessive and repressed, and eats very little to keep a slim figure. The only other dancers focused on are Lily, who might be trying to steal Nina's role, Beth, whose early retirement left her bitter, and Veronica, who is only a minor character but is very bitchy. Lily smokes as well.

</p><p></p><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmoralRealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmoralRealityShow">Reality TV showrunners</a></h2>
Creators of Reality TV (or human interest shows) are rarely ever portrayed positively in fiction, even at the height of their popularity. Often they are considered to be sociopaths that love exploiting the pain and suffering of others to attract sensation, extremely abusive with no respect whatsoever for the man that becomes the subject of their show, narcissistic and very condemning towards anyone that is not "normal" enough (whatever the last term means). It is telling that the most critically acclaimed Flemish program ever (<em>In de gloria</em>) is all about laughing with those people.
<p></p><h2>Clowns</h2>
As discussed at the trope entry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a> is about the <em>only</em> clown portrayal that exists in fiction these days, aside from the occasional case of the clown who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesTheJobLovesTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesTheJobLovesTheLimelight">Hates the Job, Loves the Limelight</a> or the clown as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> responsible for corrupting the circus they are working on and turning it into something morally reprehensible (animal abuse and drug stories abound), which isn't much better. While the basis for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> mime dislike is their being annoying, clowns have the baggage of more ostentatious appearances and criminals (i.e., murderers, pedophiles) like John Wayne Gacy. On top of this, they're not seen as particularly talented performers even in non-evil portrayals (i.e., the obnoxious birthday party clown). The fact that circus, the medium in which most of the best and often non-stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> clowns work, is not as popular as it once was doesn't help.

</p><ul><li> Oddly enough, the founding father of modern mime, Marcel Marceau, was beloved the world over - <em>despite</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">being French</a> and <em>despite</em> inventing (or at least codifying) most of the mime techniques (including those mentioned above) that have been endlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> and mocked in the popular media. The fact that he was a war hero (helping a great many Jews, including himself, escape from Nazi-occupied France) might have a little to do with his positive portrayal, although one suspects that he also benefited from becoming popular (he first started performing widely in the mid-1950s) long, <em>long</em> before the streets of major world cities became inundated with silent, white-faced buffoons. These many inept imitators (who at certain points in recent history have almost seemed to be ubiquitous) have probably had much to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks">cheapening the image of mime</a>.
<ul><li> This became apparent after Marcel Marceau's death. One team reporting the news mentioned his death in a joking manner. The next day on <em>The View,</em> Whoopi Goldberg completely shredded the two of them. She mentioned that Marcel had a large impact on her acting (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole">Star-Derailing Role</a> aside, she is still an Oscar winner) that performing anything completely in pantomime is incredibly difficult, and that they should be ashamed of themselves.

It's probably because he creates his own original acts, whereas the hated mimes just do cheap imitations of Marcel Marceau.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Musicians</h2>
Professional musicians are another category of artist that get this treatment. Unless you're a rock/pop/hip-hop/country star or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">centuries-dead composer</a>, the stereotype is that you're living in a box or your mom's house. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">Or a box in your mom's house</a>.
<p></p><h3>Touring Musicians</h3>
<ul><li> Can go either way, but are often portrayed as drunken, obnoxious idiots who complain about anything and everything, treat fans like shit, act like divas and storm offstage over completely trivial matters, and inevitably vandalize hotel rooms and/or venue backstage areas. Expect serious delusions of grandeur and a pervasive rockstar mentality regardless of how big the band is, ESPECIALLY if they're slumming it in a run-down van that breaks down constantly.
<ul><li> Opera artists are a weird subset of this. It's not just the assumption of diva-dom, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrawnHilda">Brawn Hilda</a> trope is so ubiquitous that the uninitiated often have the idea that a high BMI is somehow necessary for the voice. Not only this, but the fact that opera is expensive to create tends to erroneously lead people to bracket them under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> tropes too (it's clear from the names of the tropes that most of these are targeted particularly at females.) And the fact that they're supposed to have excruciating, glass-shattering voices that they unleash at any opportunity.
</li><li> Promoters get an even worse rap. Most cultural portrayals of them paint them as dishonest, exploitative sleazeballs who lie to agents and bands and promise impossible things, gather a ludicrous amount of high school bands full of kids who don't know any better to buy tickets at a huge cost and sell them just so they can do the promoting for them and help them make guarantees that they would have no hope of clearing otherwise, and once the night of the show comes, the promoter will invariably fail to do most of the things they said they would and will look at bands like they're out of their minds if questioned about those things. Also, if the show doesn't go as planned, you can expect the promoter and their associates to vanish with the money and suddenly be impossible to reach. Finally, if a promoter somehow is portrayed well, they will <em>always</em> be struggling to survive amidst all the sleazy, unfair tactic-using competition who stay in business just by fucking people over and always being able to avoid trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> Among actual touring musicians, you have tagalong merch attendants. No, not professionals who do it for a living - we're talking random friends or significant others of band members. Did someone leave the van unlocked in a bad area, wander off to go drinking with a dead phone, wind up stranded an hour away in the wrong direction after venturing off to get laid, drunkenly vomit all over the inside of the van, have drugs on them at the border, or give discounts or free shit to their buddies, someone willing to hand them weed, or someone they wanted to sleep with? If so, it's generally a safe bet that it was probably a temporary merch guy, and even if they don't do anything inordinately stupid, they probably still managed to piss the band off somehow and probably also helped sour relations with the member who suggested them or insisted that they were cool.
</li><li> Also known to touring musicians are the dregs of the local openers. Virtually every act started out as a local and the vast majority of touring acts can name plenty of great locals that they love to share the stage with. We're not talking about those guys. We're talking about the stereotypical scumbag local: the one who takes too long to set up and soundcheck, complains loudly and obnoxiously about their timeslot and/or goes over and puts the entire show behind, leaves their shit all over the place when they break down after their set so that they can take off to the bar and get trashed, trashes other locals and has nothing to do with the local scene beyond what is necessary for personal gain, and generally acts like a hotshot jackass with a temporarily embarrassed millionaire mindset.

</li></ul><p></p><h3>Historical</h3>
<ul><li> In many historical cultures, including the Medieval and Renaissance West, musicians were essentially viewed as a type of prostitute, similarly to actors. The major exception was for religious and ceremonial music, which were considered a totally separate medium from secular music. This attitude still exists in many highly conservative varieties of Islam.

<p></p><h2>Pro Bodybuilders</h2>
Often portrayed as grotesque freaks or meatheaded gymrats, often stereotyped as taking every drug under the sun and not actually being very fit (in reality top-tier bodybuilders often have a training schedule reaching up to 12 hours a day; (although not all of it is spent in the gym) sometimes on top of a regular job, not to mention they afford themselves very little luxuries in terms of food), at least not compared to 'real' athletes.

The commercials are meant to appeal to casual gym goers that are too "gymtimidated" by the environment of other gyms, while discouraging the "lunks" that make up said environments from visiting Planet Fitness. This is even carried over to the actual facilities, which have a "Lunk Alarm" installed to signal unwanted gym behavior, along with a general disdain for "lunks". This, among many other issues, has made Planet Fitness itself an acceptable target amongst gymrats.

<h2>Soldiers</h2>
In general: drinking, womanizing troublemakers at best, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">rapists, pillagers and casual murderers at worst</a>. Both can show up even in ostensibly sympathetic works.

In military-themed works, lieutenants tend to be a punchline. As they combine a level of command responsibility with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">a complete lack of experience</a>, the <em>best</em> they can hope for is to be treated as puppies who might someday grow up to be someone useful if they listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Sergeant Rock</a>. At worst, "the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass." This is normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, though. Lieutenants' screwups actually getting people killed is rarer in fiction (though it happens), because that's more depressing than entertaining.

Rico himself says about the rank "If anybody ever saluted a Third Lieutenant, the light was bad."

They like to hang around at checkpoints and harass everyone for money, booze, or both. They're either people who can't function in regular society or are psychopathic manchildren from rich countries whose idea of a party is getting paid big bucks to terrorize poor people in wartorn lands just because they can and they're getting paid.

Furthermore, they are generally viewed as management's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">compliance dogs</a>, rather than actually making hard decisions when the interests of the workers and of management don't align - when their jobs are on the line, they will usually kowtow to management, then bark a big game about how the workers are their real boss, when they really don't care about anything other than their own self-interest.

The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is <em>profoundly</em> unpopular in the United States. Stereotypes run from mere annoyances (who can, at worst, slow you down and cause you to miss your plane) to sadistic fascists who enjoy stripping passengers of their shoes, possessions, and basic dignity. The security screeners who work out of sight may also be in the game, rifling through the passengers' luggage and taking items of value.
<p></p><h2>Firefighters and rescue services</h2>
Yes, even the occupations that include risking one's life on a daily basis to save other peoples' lives and, if possible, property — firemen, rescue service officers and the like — are not always immune. There is the trope of a firefighter (or somebody who aspires to be one) who himself starts fires in hopes that this will allow him to prove himself in action or out of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroismAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroismAddiction">a desire to feel needed</a>. (Yes, these characters are usually male.) And specifically in the US, there's the whole FEMA conspiracy theory... In the US Fire Service in particular, Volunteer Firefighters (Volleys) have a reputation of being "fire-hobbyists" compared to members of career departments, this can be ascribed to generally more lax physical fitness standards and more informal command structures. In media depictions the characters in these departments often tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything</a> or woefully unprepared for a real emergency.

<p></p><h2>Physicians</h2>
Most portrayals of physicians are fairly positive; it's hard to get down on an occupation whose sole raison d'etre is healing the sick and alleviating suffering. However, when physicians go wrong, they go terribly wrong. Given the gravitas of the Hippocratic Oath, there's intense drama to be played out when a physician chooses to go against his code. It's still acceptable to portray a doctor as a complete quack, especially in a comedy. In dramatic works, expect a cold sociopath who sees patients as dollars or a collection of symptoms whose suffering is irrelevant.
<ul><li> A growing stereotype is that of the doctor who only cares about getting positive feedback from patients, even at the expense of the patients' actual health. Such doctors will casually prescribe unnecessary, addictive, or otherwise dangerous drugs at the patients' request, let impending health problems go untreated, and make sure only to tell the patients what they want to hear rather than give them advice on healthy living that might be seen as insulting. (Note that this may not be <em>entirely</em> the doctor's fault: many doctors these days have to answer to insurers, hospital administrators, the Joint Commission, and others in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adminisphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adminisphere">Adminisphere</a>, who hold them to strict metrics like Press-Ganey, HCAHPS, and patient satisfaction surveys. If they do not meet these metrics, or if they get a bad review on a site like Yelp from a patient who's irate because the doctor told them something they didn't want to hear, they can be penalized, up to and including being fired from the hospital or clinic where they work.)
</li><li> On a related note, practitioners of alternative health care will often be portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Granola Girl</a> ditzes or knowingly malign peddlers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalSnakeOil">All-Natural Snake Oil</a> in works which embrace Enlightenment on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment">Romanticism Versus Enlightenment</a> conflict.
</li><li> Another topic is the illegal organ trade.
</li><li> Physicians who treat life-or-death cases are likely to be sued for malpractice when they fail to help a patient, even if there's nothing that could have been done. This means that they need extensive malpractice insurance, which invites accusations that they are incompetent or casual murderers. After all, why would a doctor insure himself against malpractice if he didn't plan on committing some?
</li><li> What's the difference between a doctor and a lawyer? A lawyer will rob you; a doctor will rob you <em>and</em> kill you.
</li><li> Among doctors and medical students, primary care doctors tend to be acceptable career targets, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">they don't specialize</a>, and they don't make as much money as specialists. (Which is one reason why there's a shortage of PCPs; so many medical students are choosing specialties instead.)
</li><li> Subject to changes depending on geography. Countries with universal healthcare systems (i.e. where patients don't get billed for medical care) tend to have a more positive portrayal of doctors, due to the lack of any financial motive.

Often, the only psychiatry depicted will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">electroshock therapy</a>.
<ul><li> Oh, psychotherapy is a lot more sinister than that. After all, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">messing</a> with your <em>mind</em>, maaan!

</li><li> And of course, you'll rarely see any that subscribe to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">biological, cognitive or behavioral models</a> of psychopathology.
</li><li> Or prescribe any medication (since psychologists and psychiatrists are the same thing, and also because all of them are Freudians who want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianCouch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianCouch">talk about your neuroses for an hour while you lie on a couch</a>). If they do, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMedicationForMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMedicationForMe">their patients will refuse to take it</a>, which is depicted as being liberating instead of risky or dangerous.
</li><li> Even sympathetic psychiatric workers will usually have the conflict of being the voice of wisdom and experience in the office while being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes">plagued by personal issues they can't solve</a> at home.

</li><li> Another somewhat sympathetic portrayal will show them as futilely attempting to treat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> villain of the work. Invariably, the villain will prove to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">too evil to help</a>, with the poor doctor unaware of this until he becomes the next victim. Expect at least one scene with the psychiatrist ineffectually begging his patient to step off the path of destruction he's following.
</li><li> A certain group, referred to on this wiki as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Church of Happyology</a>, considers psychiatrists to be their mortal enemy (perhaps because if there's one thing a meme can't stand, it's competition and the possibility of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deprogramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deprogramming">deprogramming</a>). Consequently, they spend an inordinate effort attempting to discredit this profession. Some of the anti-psychiatry ideas floating around out there may have originated with this Church.
</li><li> Not to mention the cliche where people with mental illness are portrayed as mildly eccentric goofballs who just need a person to listen to them and offer a kind word and helping hand rather than professional care or medication. This subtly implies that psychiatrists and psychologists do not listen and never, ever offer a kind word or helping hand. It also implies mental illness is not really a disease but a personality trait, which is a rather dangerous implication.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Comic Books</span>
</p><ul><li> Raoul Cauvin's work <em>Psy</em> is a gag-a-day strip mocking with the profession of psychologists. While his other gag-a-day strips have also laughed with professions (such as is the case with gravediggers (<em>Pierre Tombal</em>) and cops (<em>Agent 212</em>)) they portray the characters that do that profession in a positive and sympathetic light. This is pretty much lacking in this work, since the main character is a workaholic freudworshipping asshole that even gets the most basic aspects of psychiatry wrong.

</li></ul><p></p><h2>Nurses</h2>
<ul><li> Portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalHottie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HospitalHottie">oversexed</a> bimboes who spend more time flirting with doctors (or occasionally patients) than treating patients, and who weren't smart enough to make it through medical school and got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredForTheirLooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredForTheirLooks">Hired for Their Looks</a>. (Which is, of course, not true at all; nurses work just as hard as doctors, arguably moreso, and nursing school is <em>most assuredly</em> not something that just anyone can do or is cut out for.) Because nursing is a primarily female-dominated profession, its portrayal <em>frequently</em> comes with a heaping helping of misogyny. Male nurses (if they're shown at all) are almost always portrayed as either gay, or using their profession to get with female nurses or patients. Female nurses still wear short white dresses and caps, occasionally with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki">thigh-high stockings underneath</a>, even though nurses haven't worn outfits like that for decades; in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, both male and female nurses wear scrubs.

</li><li> All physicists ever do is nukes. Some of them may also develop God complexes or build other types of superweapons, but in the end, it all boils down to nukes.
</li><li> Chemists are also seen as spouting Technobabble in the form of chemical nomenclature (under whose rules names of compounds can get long and messy). Chemists are also sometimes portrayed either as bomb-makers, as drug-makers, or as poisoners. If not, then they will usually have tendencies towards them, such as pyromania or toxomania. Chemistry is also seen as the science that is most harmful to the environment, and this coupled with some chemical disasters and the technobabble spouted by chemists has given rise to <em>chemophobia</em>, an irrational prejudice against "artificial" chemicals.

Despite being the reason for any profession's continuation. Parents are often blamed for a child's bad behavior, but if the child can barely count to ten on their fingers then it's all the teachers fault. Don't even start with the jokes involving sex or pedophilia. Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> aspects, not all teachers enjoy, want, or desire extracurricular activities with their students, even if they are in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher">Hot for Teacher</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian">Hot Librarian</a> category. Other insults include becoming a teacher "for the great holidays" and nothing else, digs about the wages (most common in US based shows), and running the gamut from alcoholic to depressive to passive-aggressive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieTeacher">pleasant but useless</a>. The reasoning behind teachers as acceptable targets could probably be put down to familiarity - almost everyone in countries where education is mandatory has met a teacher at some point. Not many of us can claim that a marine biologist was nasty to us, but most people had a teacher that they didn't like.
<ul><li> See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>, for the teachers who use their positions to abuse students.
</li><li> One popular insult aimed at teachers is "those who can, do. Those who can't, teach." Teachers of younger children get this particularly badly with comedians often cracking jokes such as "all you have to do is make stuff out of pasta". Tip: before making this comment, try teaching someone who doesn't know how to hold a pencil how to write. The fact that high school teachers are normally very well versed in their chosen field is normally dismissed, leading to characters who became teachers because "they weren't good at anything else".
</li><li> Once someone is identified as a piano teacher, you know what will happen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> shows several teacher stereotypes.
</li><li> There also is the stereotype of drama, music or other fine arts teachers as being washed up performers who can't get work anywhere else (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSteveHarveyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSteveHarveyShow">The Steve Harvey Show</a></em>).

Pretty much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a> subset of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>, with the added benefit of never actually helping or teaching anyone. Aside from looks of scorn, most will only get a trademark "SHHHHHHHHHH!" Outside their realm of power, they're depicted as lonely, bitter, anal-aggressive spinsters. This is somewhat amusing, as unless you're going to become an archivist or a cataloger, serving patrons is going to be the majority of what you do. However, as a contrast, there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotLibrarian">Hot Librarian</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Ms. Censordoll</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> is a text book example of this. Unlike most librarians, she actively embraces censoring books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She's just about to close up the library!!!</span> Oh yes, definitely the worst fate that could befall anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Unshelved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Unshelved">Unshelved</a></em> averts this trope, or rather uses stereotypes of librarians that librarians themselves use (aka Dewey the snarky and hip YA librarian, Mel the overworked and stressed out manager, Tamara the overly cheery children's librarian, the rarely-seen socially challenged and weird cataloger, etc). Colleen is the closest to the standard librarian stereotype, but she's portrayed as being largely a dinosaur in the modern world of librarianship. It also turns the tables in that most of the jokes make fun of library <em>patrons</em>. This may have something to do with the fact that the writer is himself a librarian.
</li><li> Th mid-90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParkerPosey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParkerPosey">Parker Posey</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PartyGirl">Party Girl</a></em> portrays working in a library relatively accurately (even pointing out that not everyone who works in a library is a librarian—as with doctors, lawyers, and teachers, to be a librarian requires earning a professional degree, in library science in this case). It's therefore become a bit of a cult classic amongst librarians.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Home Education</h2>
Anyone who's trained at home via anything like correspondence courses <em>will</em> be at best depicted as incompetent at their profession and at worst outright moronic overall, often without a hint of joking. Though nowadays in real life home computers, the internet, and video streaming technology have made home schooling a valid and effective means of education (sometimes more effective than a classroom setting), this is never the case on the screen.
<ul><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> issue had Jughead's cousin repair an air conditioner for Archie's family. As they're powering it on Jughead remarks his cousin knew what he was doing as he just finished his correspondence course in appliance repair. Cue Archie quipping "Correspondence course?! Now you tell me!" and the ac unit blowing the power for the whole neighborhood.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Anthology Of Interest I" Dr. Zoidberg remarks he has mail-order degrees in "Murderology" and "Murderonomy" and sets out to solve the case. Needless to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">it's Zoidberg</a> and he doesn't accomplish much before being murdered himself.

When you need a villain, look no further. All drug dealers are scum who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer">cruise the playgrounds looking for kids (the younger the better) to sell dope to</a>. If you need a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, just make him the leader of the gang. While all criminals get this treatment to a degree, drug dealers are considered especially heinous, in part due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonization</a> they've received due to the American War on Drugs and countless education films. Other criminal professions may at least be portrayed somewhat sympathetically, but rarely in fiction will you find a sympathetic drug dealer. The horrific violence inflicted both on rival criminals and unaffiliated civilians by groups such as the Mexican and Colombian drug cartels in recent decades has also had a profound impact, and suffice to say, there is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to their negative portrayal.

Whether they're exotic dancers, adult models, porn actresses, or sex workers, women who make a living with their bodies are only treated sympathetically if they have some kind of circumstance putting them into that line of work, like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMomStripper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMomStripper">child to feed</a> or college bills to pay. Women who actually <em>enjoy</em> the work are treated as airheaded bimbos at best and crackwhores at worst. Sex workers of all stripes also make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker">easy prey for murderers</a>, and when they become victims there is usually a subtle (or not-so-subtle) hint that they deserved it for being less innocent (and sympathetic) than a "wholesome" woman.

Bling's organization, the Happy Sperm Club, is noted for straight-up <em>kidnapping</em> and imprisoning girls — sometimes even <em>prepubescent</em> girls — and brutally conditioning them to sexually service men. (Said conditioning often takes the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">beatings</a> and starvation until the women are simply too weak to resist unwelcome advances.

However, Bling is also noted to care very much about his customers and his cronies, to the point where his business model would be downright commendable if he'd chosen a less immoral profession, and he reacts <em>very</em> poorly to his subordinates being injured, arrested, or killed. He actually goes very well out of his way to stay under the radar to protect his clients' reputations, as well. All of this does nothing to make him sympathetic, due to his aforementioned horrible treatment of women.

Almost no one at a strip club is ever portrayed sympathetically.

The standard joke being that no one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes">who became a freakin' guidance counselor</a></em> has any business helping young people decide what to do with their lives.
<p></p><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheMotivationalSpeaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheMotivationalSpeaker">Motivational Speakers</a></h2>
Take all the stereotypes of other "those who can't, teach" professions, and stick them in front of a room of office workers who are there not by choice, but by managerial coercion. Let all those office workers regress to the way they behaved the last time they were forced to sit in rows in front of an authority figure. Now take all that simmering resentment and put it in the heads of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">sitcom characters</a></em>, and stand well back.
<p></p><h2>Priests</h2>
Doesn't matter what religious order, or whatever good they might do in the community - as far as a lot of the population is concerned, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a> stereotype is invoked. In the cases where it isn't invoked, they're portrayed as rich aristocrat-types who are somewhat backward, despite as a rule having graduate degrees and many priests making somewhat less than teachers (there's a lot of clergy who have had to rely on charity to survive old age).
<ul><li> Even older than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a> stereotype is the stereotype of the priest as a willful con artist, someone who manipulates people's fears and superstitions in order to live without working. Voltaire loved this one: <em>"The first priest was the first rogue who met the first fool."</em>
</li><li> An even older one is the stereotype that priests often claim to be in the name of god but that they in fact are still doing sins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReynardTheFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReynardTheFox">Reynard the Fox</a> for instance spoke about one brief scene in which the priest was fucking with a woman and plenty of medieval intellectuals spoke out against the hypocrisy of the church when they made themselve luxurious all the while Jesus said that you had to live poor and sober.
</li><li> <em>Sleepers</em> inverts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a> stereotype; not only is the priest not the one who molested the four main characters, but he actively helps them punish the men who did.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Slavers</h2>
Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>, anyone who deals in slaves, and generally, anyone who owns slaves, will be depicted in the most negative light possible, and are highly likely to suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>. The same applies for hired slave-drivers and slave-catchers.
<p></p><h2>Landlords</h2>
Between their role in various housing crises and the inherently passive nature of the work (as it's largely just buying the property and waiting for rent to come in), landlords frequently don't get any respect. While the low-level homeowners renting out a bit of their property tend to get the comparatively lower-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrankyLandlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrankyLandlord">Cranky Landlord</a>, who is nasty and loutish but not much else, the wealthier ones who actively buy up lots of property with the purpose of renting it out will often be characterized as cruel, unempathetic, classist, gentrifying, and desiring nothing more than a return to serfdom, who would boot a cancer patient and her baby out on the street if she missed one month's rent or spilled milk on the floor.
<p><span class="asscaps">Anime and Manga</span>
</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s Frieza, of all characters, was stated by creator Akira Toriyama to be based on a landlord, with his business of conquering worlds, murdering their inhabitants, and selling them off for massive profits being essentially landlording on a massive scale.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Unemployed</h2>
Just when you thought you could escape this trope, they are lazy young people wasting their parents' and taxpayers' money, contributing nothing to society. Or 'welfare queens', though the latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets">strongly associated with racist stereotypes</a>.
<p></p></div>
<hr/><p><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Did we miss anyone?</a></em>
</p><ul><li> Carpenters, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">the world's most famous Carpenter</a> rendering this occupation unmockable. Despite this, there's actually rather compelling evidence that he was a stonemason rather than a carpenter, given his love of using rock terminology in metaphors.
