<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em> had Kino meet a woman and the man she had hired as a guard as they were about to set out on a journey. She sat with the man for a while, and learned that he had killed her husband several years ago accidentally while robbing his store, and had been reformed and set free by their justice system, on the condition that he make it up to the woman by mutual agreement. It's made clear that his reform and desire to help the woman any way he can in penance for his crime are genuine. They part, and later Kino is riding through the woods when she hears a gunshot  it turns out the woman wasn't so big on the penance idea after all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Sasuke starts to fall into this as his sanity goes off the deep end. At first, his revenge is reasonable; he just wants to kill Itachi for murdering his entire family (plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">mind raping</a> him). Then Itachi dies, and he finds out that Itachi was a good guy all along, but was pressured into killing the Uchihas because they were going to revolt. So Sasuke shifts his revenge to Danzo, the guy who got Itachi to kill his clan, ignoring that the Uchihas provoked it by threatening civil war (Mind you Danzo was responsible for a truck load of just as horrible actions that likely would have seen him executed had everything been exposed and once he is gone nobody is really shedding tears over it). And once Danzo dies, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">shifts his revenge</a> to <em>everyone in Konoha</em> for being happy at the same time his brother was suffering.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>, Jin killed his master Mariya Enshirou in self-defense. Try telling that to Mariya's <em>other</em> students, who are hunting for Jin throughout the series to avenge him. Particularly notable is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">Not-So-Harmless Villain</a> Ogura Bunta, who managed to hold his own against Jin when he finally encountered him. The shame of his defeat, however, caused Bunta to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>, according to Jin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> Yukimaru. For his part, Yukimaru doesn't care about their master, and just wants to kill Jin to absorb the reputation of the thousand man killer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both the Crane Hermit and Tien Shinhan are furious at Goku for killing Mercenary Tao, their younger brother and mentor, respectively. Goku calls them out on it, pointing out that Tao was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> who was hired by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmiesAreEvil">Red Ribbon Army</a> to kill <em>him</em> and killed one of his friends, and he was only defending himself; neither of them cares. Though Tien later gets over himself and becomes one of Goku's allies.
</li><li> Dr. Gero wants Goku dead because Goku destroyed the Red Ribbon Army and cost him his funding. This is ignoring the fact that the Red Ribbons were an evil group who terrorized innocent people and wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, and Gero willingly built killer robots to help them. Later material elaborates that Gero also wanted to avenge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">his son</a>, who died fighting for the army, but it's still incredibly myopic considering that Gero's son still died for a leader who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">didn't care</a> and a cause that would've made the world a worse place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>: Kuyou's entire motive when he comes back in Season II is to get revenge on Tsukune for defeating and humiliating him. Sure, never mind the fact that Kuyou is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">human-hating</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who abused his status as the head of the Student Police to make everyone at Yokai Academy miserable, and Tsukune defeated him <em>after</em> Kuyou threatened his friends and nearly killed him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burning him alive</a>, purely because he was a human.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kagari's</a> motivations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiSuzuneMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiSuzuneMagica">Puella Magi Suzune Magica</a></em> puts her schemes well into this territory. Kagari orchestrated the events of the series, from making Suzune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> to kill other magical girls to erasing the her memories of herself and her little sister Matsuri, because she wants revenge for Suzune killing their mutual mentor and mother figure Tsubaki. The problem is that while Suzune killed Tsubaki, it was both unintentional and necessary: Tsubaki had been <em>protecting</em> Suzune and ended up using too much magic, darkening her Soul Gem and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie">turning into a Witch</a>, forcing Suzune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">to put her down</a>. Heartbreaking yes, but a sad fact of their universe. Kagari seems to think that this makes her justified in forcing Suzune to kill other magical girls who are innocent in this feud before dropping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> on her head, which would force Suzune into despair and turn her into a Witch herself so Kagari can kill her and "make Suzune suffer just like Tsubaki did." Of course, Kagari is both insane and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadist</a>, and freely admits to Suzune she made the plan much more complicated than it needed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">because it gave her a thrill</a>, so some of the myopia was likely intentional.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: When Baron Ashura gets killed by Koji Kabuto, his boss Dr. Hell swears revenge on the heroes. The fact that Ashura had attempted to kill them literally several dozens of times, at the behest of Hell himself, until Koji and his friends had no option but to kill him in self-defence, is easily overlooked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, Yukishiro Enishi wants revenge on Kenshin for killing Tomoe's fiancee and destroying her happiness, before killing her (though by accident) and taking away the only person Enishi loved. However, Tomoe never died hating Kenshin but instead tried to protect him. He doesn't realize the truth until he is given her diary right at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SuteraretaYuushaNoEiyuutan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SuteraretaYuushaNoEiyuutan">Suterareta Yuusha No Eiyuutan</a></em>: Despite bullying Daichi, horrifically, for years, and throwing him into a monster pit to be Eaten Alive, he swears graphic vengeance on Daichi the moment Daichi has him cornered in a dungeon. That is, until Daichi kills him over, and over, and over again, so that he learns how being helplessly bullied feels like.

They're driven by vengeance towards Mega-City One for nuking their own home city - and Judge Dredd in particular, who launched the missiles.

Lexor blows up, Lex's family dies, and Luthor, who is all but physically unable to take responsibility for his own actions, swears revenge on Superman.
</li></ul></li><li> Slade Wilson aka <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a></em> has a bad history with this:
<ul><li> In his first story arc, Deathstroke blamed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Titans</a> for the death of his eldest son Grant. Except a) the only reason Grant died was because he underwent the same super soldier experiment that gave Slade his powers but which proved fatal to Grant and b) Grant died trying to kill the Titans. And despite not wanting his son to follow the same path as him, Slade chooses to blame the Titans for Grant's death rather than go after H.I.V.E., the organization that performed the fatal experiment on Grant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, Slade destroyed Blüdhaven, the city <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> protected by dropping the super villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Chemo</a>, a monster made of radioactive energies, into it. When confronted by Batman, Nightwing and Robin (Tim Drake) Slade goes into a rant about how Nightwing had turned his family against him when in reality Slade had either turned his back on his family or did a good enough job of making them hate him himself.

He does this by killing two of Jaime's relatives who were held captive, killing several men on his own side to get to them. It's pointed out that killing defenseless prisoners and your own allies is not the same as killing an enemy in battle, but the distinction seems lost on him since he's basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">half-mad with anger and grief</a> by that point.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> episode "Blind Alley", Mystique pretends to be Scott's brother Alex, supposedly stuck in Mexico after losing his passport, in order to lure Scott out on his own, knocking him out and leaving him stuck in the middle of the Mexican desert without his glasses to stop his eyes, saying "That's payback!" after Scott let her get captured inside a military base in "Day of Recovery". However Scott did that because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had abducted Professor X and impersonated him throughout the two-part episode "Day of Reckoning",</span> and refused to divulge the location of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the real Professor X.</span> Note that when he managed to find his way to the city, she intended to knock him out and do it again, somewhere even more remote.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> has a surprisingly low amount of this, as while most of Dan's revenge schemes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">pretty petty reasons and minuscule problems that wasn't an issue at first sight</a>, it turns out that he's coincidentally right about many of the targets deserving it. An exception, however, is "Neighbors", in which Dan learns that new neighbors (who are much nicer and Dan never liked to begin with) are now moving next door to him. It takes a pie they baked him to fall on his car to finally take revenge on them, ignoring the fact that Dan was the one who dropped the pie on his own car in the first place.
<ul><li> Interestingly inverted in "Telemarketers", where Dan's imposter stalks and tortures Dan via telemarketing as revenge for getting him locked up in "Dan", which was for trying to steal Dan's identity and life in the latter episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> segment <em>Mandarker</em> cements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Mandark's</a> motive for outshining Dexter, as revenge for destroying his lab (through Dee Dee). But while it does a good job creating sympathy for Mandark, what it fails to mention is that Dexter did that in retaliation for Mandark forcing him to shut down <em>his</em> lab. He curiously doesn't blame Dee Dee (who he has a crush on) even accusing Dexter of tricking her into doing it. A later episode reveals that Mandark's real motive is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">payback for Dexter making fun of his original name</a> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">"Susan"</a>.
</li><li> Frizz and Nug were at the constant receiving end of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>. The heroes thrived on punishing them for trying to steal the title stone and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">ruin dreams</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">often far more severely than the crime itself</a>). They never take notice to the fact they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragAlong">The Drag-Along</a> in every instance, either due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressGanged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressGanged">Press-Ganged</a> by Sgt Blob and Urpgor or because Zordrak threatens to <em>execute</em> them if they don't. It's implied the heroes went through a great few Urpneys in this manner, before Zordrak simply got bored of offing minions. Later episodes try to make the heroes more pragmatic, as well as give them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">a much better provocation</a> so their vendetta seems more proportionate, though the fact nearly all Urpneys are unwilling slaves is still never remotely brought up between them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Starlight Glimmer wants revenge on Twilight Sparkle and her friends for taking Starlight's village away from her. She's completely ignorant of that her village was a horrible place to live, that the villagers there were under duress and threatened with imprisonment and borderline torture for any dissent, or that the entire reason Twilight ruined it was in order to free herself and her friends after being kidnapped, imprisoned, and borderline tortured into joining her cult.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em>, the Winter Soldier claims to be out to avenge himself on Red Skull, but is willing to murder plenty of innocents in the process if he has to.
