They also tend to use a unique variations of this trope especially with the dreamseers. Who can see the possible futures both good and bad. They'll tell the rest of the cast whenever the future is good, however when the future is generally bad they won't say anything. The reason behind this is because as long as they don't tell the key players that future then they can change it, but telling others of that future can set it in stone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And the <em>only</em> dreamseer who actually DID say the future was still unchanged... said so after <em>her</em> death</span>.

</li><li> Also during the second tag duel in the fifth movie, Ataru refuses to say that he loves Lum despite the stakes — because under those circumstances the words wouldn't be meaningful.

<ul><li> The Wolkenritter are concerned about Hayate being uncovered as master of the Book of Darkness and being labeled a criminal as a result, which could be one reason why they don't tell Nanoha and her friends their story.
</li><li> Also, all of the TSAB's experience with them at that point was as emotionless, deadly constructs who would stop at nothing to protect the Book of Darkness - not exactly people with a trustworthy reputation.

Unfortunately, Rakan swore them to silence until he "acknowledges Negi as a man", seemingly so that Negi would have even more incentive to beat him in their upcoming fight.
</li><li> Naturally, it's then revealed with no build up at all, by a newly introduced character. It's later confirmed by Jack Rakan, in the same offhand manner:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory">My Love Story!!</a></em> plays this straight between Takeo and Rinko for about three episodes before Makoto gets annoyed and forces them both to tell the truth, resulting in the two going steady almost immediately. Makoto basically spares the audience about 20 episodes worth of angst and romantic tension.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em> plays with this trope in just about every way possible. In the first chapter it's averted, with protagonist Asahi going to confess to his classmate Youko...only to get thrown off his stride when he walks into the classroom and sees her with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">fangs and giant bat wings</a>.

He hides his true feelings for a while, but in hindsight he decides it's better this way since if he'd said "Be my girlfriend" right then, it would have looked like he was blackmailing her. A couple of friends who have known him for years also think it's a good thing, since Asahi has a tendency to admire girls and mistake that admiration for love<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0okh5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0okh5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0okh5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is exactly what happened with Youko — she projected the image of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">cool beauty</a>, but is actually cheerful, friendly, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">kind of an airhead</a></span>, but by being friends first he gets to know the real Youko and develop actual feelings for her. He does end up confessing for real about halfway through the series, and the two become a couple, though the confession letter he wrote in the first chapter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">doesn't get opened until the very last</a>.
<ul><li> There's also other characters who have feelings for Asahi, and can't spit it out for various reasons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a> Nagisa is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">an alien who got most of her knowledge on Earth by reading manga</a>, and is also incredibly insecure about her feelings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Shiho</a> tries to deny her feelings for Asahi because she and Youko have known each other since they were kids and she'd never do anything as scummy as stealing her best friend's boyfriend. And of course, both of them are major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shippers on Deck</a> for the couple (while Youko ships Nagisa with Asahi before realizing her own feelings). Both of them actually do confess, but entirely so that Asahi can let them down gently and they can move on with their lives.
</li><li> And then there's the non-romantic version with the main plot, which is most prominent with Rin, Asahi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Granddaughter from the Future</a>. She could very easily clear up a lot of the mysteries and confusion about the plot (in particular whom Asahi ends up marrying), but she's expressly forbidden from revealing future knowledge, with her punishment for doing so being barred from returning to the future for some time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Near the end of the series, as the cast starts to put things together, she says "To hell with the rules" and owns up to everything because she wants to prevent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> she comes from where practically the entire cast are alone and sad due to their friendships and lives breaking down.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em> is obviously attracted to Jean, even though she otherwise claims he's merely a friend. Unfortunately she is unable to admit her love for him <em>or</em> what she actually wants from him because she simply doesn't know how to act appropriately except through rage (she gradually changes that behavior). Jean, by contrast, is much more open, honest, and demonstrative.

</li><li> Naruto. He had extreme admiration and fondness for his teammate Sasuke, viewing him as his best friend and the person he could relate to more than anyone else, wanting his acknowledgment. However, he was too stubborn, prideful and jealous of Sasuke's skills and reputation to ever admit it, and acted like he hated him most of the time. Until Sasuke stabbed a chidori through his chest and nearly killed him... yeah, it took that much. Of course, their relationship was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">complicated, even in the best of times</a>.
</li><li> Naruto was also this with his other teammate Sakura; he couldn't confess that he had a crush on her due to his promise to bring back Sasuke. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> when Sakura used this promise to kill Sasuke and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim">spare Naruto further emotional pain</a> by giving him her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">infamous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession">fake love confession</a> so he'd stop chasing him.

Often even the exceptions turn out not to be exceptions. For example, Asuka's flamboyant confessions of love for Kaji <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy">are to mask her growing attraction</a> to Shinji.

She has a hard time speaking her feelings to her childhood friend, Shouta. This is compounded by her attempt to appeal to him by going along with what she incorrectly thinks is Shota's fetish for girls in diapers. She stumbles over her attempt to declare her love for Shouta while showing him she's wearing one and accidentally convinces him <em>she</em> has the fetish as a result. In a later chapter, she fantasizes about trying again but can't go through with it.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Ahiru can't tell Mytho that she loves him — Not because of nervousness, but because she will <em>cease to exist</em> once she does. This becomes very troublesome in the first season finale when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Princess Kraehe offers to return Mytho's emotion of love, but only if she says that she loves him.</span>

</li><li> Another example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople">Homura</a>. She knows she loves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madoka</span>, and is highly motivated by those feelings...but she can't express them without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">breaking down</a> and sobbing incoherently (as seen in episodes 8 and 12).

Kazama <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">likes girls too</a>, and very openly... But Sumika isn't her type, and is petrified that a confession of love would destroy their friendship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As of chapter 20, the tension is even more balanced on this, from both sides: Kazama is in love with Sumika as well, but doesn't know that Sumika likes girls (or even just her), so she is also terrified that confessing <em>her</em> love would tear them apart.</span>

Unfortunately, Miku can't bring herself to confess and Hibiki is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">far too dense</a> to figure it out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The final scene in the series has Miku finally work up the courage to presumably confess her love, with Hibiki replying that she <em>also</em> has something to tell Miku and hopes it's the same thing, but the series ends without any explicit confirmation</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> spent an entire episode milking the trope, as Momoka's attempts to refer to Fuyuki on a first-name basis lead to increasingly absurd changes in the conversation.

This, of course, drives her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsundere</a> behavior towards him; since she can't spit it out, beating him up works too.

She can't tell Kaede and Micchy she is more into fashion then otaku stuff, and she <em>really</em> can't say that she is in love with Kaede, especially to herself. This latter also causes her to have difficulty referring to Kaede by her first name.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure">Smile Pretty Cure!</a></em>, Yayoi decides to pull an April Fools prank, saying that she's going to get transferred to another school. It's all fine and dandy, except for one hitch - the person she told it to was Miyuki, who panics and begins spreading the news, spiraling into Reiko holding a farewell party with the rest of the class and Yayoi unable to say anything because the other girls keep putting words in her mouth. It isn't until Akaoni reveals the truth through a manga Yayoi drew and lost that the girls realize that it was a lie. They're pretty disappointed at her... until they realize it was Miyuki's fault for believing it in the first place!

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em>, an early episode has D-Boy's transformation crystal being broken, forcing him to use a modified Pegas robot to transform into Blade. Late in the series, when he's losing his memory due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a>, he forgets that his crystal broke and starts trying to transform on his own. Despite that he is searching the ground frantically and asking, over and over again, where his crystal is, Pegas refuses to say even something as simple is "I have your crystal, give me the command," instead uninformatively urging D-Boy to transform. Later, he dryly explains, "D-Boy refuses to access my Tek-Set function."

All it would take to save the group tons and tons of trouble every episode is for somebody to approach an Elf and say "Hello, there. This might seem like an odd request but my friends and I are looking for fragments of a very important spell that's been imprinted on the bodies of five random Elf women. You don't happen to have recently found yourself with a strange marking on your body, have you? You HAVE? Great! Would you mind if we went to a quiet, private location to check if it's one of the fragments and remove that for you if it is?" Instead of, y'know, randomly assaulting and ripping the clothes off every one they come across.
</li><li> Kotetsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> has this tendency to the point of it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>.

Both they and their human masters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">are not comfortable with this</a>. Sammy in particular is a good example: she hides her concern <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and growing affection</span> for her master Rikuo, and is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">afraid to be seen at the cafe even after he finds out she's a regular</span>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>. In the first chapter, Rito plays it straight and then subverts it when he does finally confess to Haruna. Only for Lala to get in the way. It then plays the trope fairly straight for a time. However the reason changes from shyness to indecisiveness as he is no longer sure of his feelings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As soon as he is sure of his feelings for Lala, he confesses to her immediately, then goes to confess to Haruna who he still loves, making it a subversion.</span>

That or circumstances will interrupt him, like a spacecraft suddenly about to plunge down onto the city. Of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">she has no clue</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura">Tona-Gura!</a></em>, would-be couple Kazuki Arisaka and Yuuji Kagura sometimes get so flustered by their obvious feelings that they cannot speak to each other at all, not out of anger, but out of trepidation. In one instance, where he has fallen on top of her (legit in this case, despite his immature tendency to grab at her), they are at this point so tongue-tied that a primal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Pervert</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> moment passes with only a few "Excuse Me"s — and that's all.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari">Umi Monogatari</a></em>, Kanon doesn't confess that she likes Kojima because she's afraid he'll reject her.

Also because she doesn't really know <em>how</em> — everything outside of "how to be a sexbot" she's had to learn on her own and is still very naive about most things.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>.

<ul><li> Catarina has a large mixed gender harem, all of whom were <em>supposed</em> to be interested in each other in various ways. Since she thinks that they still must be into each other like they are in the game they were based on, she doesn't factor herself into the group's romantic interactions. All of them are trying to get her to figure it out by being indirect and get frustrated when she completely blows them off. Only Maria and Mary get close to actually spitting it out. For Maria in particular there is no excuse: The lines she gives are ones that Catarina <em>knows</em> would be a confession if they were said to anyone else.
</li><li> Catarina's parents, the Duke and Duchess, had one in the backstory. They both fell in love with each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">at first sight</a>, but never <em>told</em> each other. Catarina's father basically proposed to her mother by going to her father instead, which he feels guilty about. In the original timeline, this eventually led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>; the Duke adopted a boy with strong magic, who the Duchess assumed was his illegitimate child. She hated the boy and shunned her husband, becoming a bitter old shrew and contributing both to Catarina's villainy (as she was left to be spoiled by her father) and Keith's womanizing (because he was starved for affection). In the new timeline, Catarina's attempts to be nice to Keith result in the Duchess confronting the Duke about it. When she realizes Keith is <em>not</em> her husband's bastard, she becomes much nicer to him, and the Duke and Duchess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">enter into a honeymoon phase</a>.

While initially Krystal insists that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriageOfConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriageOfConvenience">it's just a political marriage</a> and they don't have to do anything, they quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">realize that's stupid, admit they're in love with each other, and treat their marriage as real</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the manga was originally going to be a long case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>, but plans changed very early on.

</li><li> Charlotte Roselei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>. She has a very bad experience of this when it comes to the one she is in love with. When Yami only wants to ask her about the curse she suffered from, not only does she interrupt him but also <em>runs away screaming</em> when she thinks he is about to make her confess. Eventually, she admits her love for Yami to her squad and they are supportive about it, much to her surprise. But she's still completely unable to admit it it <em>to Yami</em>. For added hilarity, he shows up to talk to her almost immediately afterwards.

He never told Mary Jane while they were dating, either — <em>she</em> had to tell <em>him</em> that she knew his secret.
</li><li> When May <em>does</em> find out and talks to Peter, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/ComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/ComicBooks">one of the most touching scenes in comics</a>, including the part where she specifically points out that she's a big girl and she won't just keel over, and that she <em>will</em> be worried, but he has her blessing.

When Dr. Stephen Strange was staying at the Ancient One's retreat, he discovered that the Ancient One's disciple Baron Mordo was trying to kill his master. Mordo found out and placed a spell on Strange, magically gagging him whenever he tried to warn Mordo's master. Recognizing Mordo's evil and the need to counter it, Strange offered himself as the Ancient One's new disciple. The first thing the Ancient One did was remove Mordo's enchantment from Strange, which he knew about all along ("A student can have no secrets from his master.")

</li><li> This happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a> fanfic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildrenOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildrenOfTheStars">Children Of The Stars</a>, where Keleria - madly in love with Ayuri and most certainly wanting to express her feelings - <em>won't</em> allow herself to spit it out rather than wanting to and just getting cold feet.
</li><li> A huge point of plot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> fanfic <em>Toward the World's End</em>. Protagonist Arthur is clearly in love with Nanoha, which is obvious to everyone except Nanoha and <em>himself</em>. Arthur constantly grapples with the fact that he has no clue what he actualy feels for Nanoha, other than that it is more than friendship. He <em>does</em> reffer to Fate as his "rival for Nanoha's love" toward the end of the 2nd fanfic however, with the revelation more directed at the fact that Arthur now understood Fate's feelings, rather than his own. However, it may suggest that he is at least slightly comming to terms with how feels.
<ul><li> This gets so extreme that the other characters make jabs at Arthur about it, and several of them have a "side" that they're on (Either supporting Arthur or Fate ending up with Nanoha). Particualy, Arthur's fellow forwards often use this as a talking point at lunch time. Subaru in particular. None of these characters have any problem spitting it out to Nanoha either, making several jokes about Arthur's feelings around her.

<ul><li> The fall and damnation of Satan, the eternal struggle between heaven and hell, and the loss of quite a few demigods is due to all the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToReignInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToReignInHell">To Reign in Hell</a></em> performing an extended dance remix of this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos">The Rise of Endymion</a></em>, the main character spends a great deal of energy angsting over a period of time that his love spent unaccounted for while he was off touring planets, having kidney stones, and eluding the Space Pope. No, really. He deduces that this time was spent with another man, and angsts accordingly. At length. Of course, he can't bear to ask her about it; otherwise she might have told him that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thanks to some time travel tomfoolery, the other man was <em>him.</em></span> However, considering how much of the plot's pacing hinges on said lover's constant reluctance to give information that would explain anything to anyone, maybe not.

Each lies or hides the truth "for the greater good." The resulting confusion, interpersonal conflict, jealousy, and setbacks invariably stem from the main characters' inability or unwillingness to communicate. In the end, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the good guys are on the same side!</span> Who knew?
</li><li> A recurring theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s books, where couples spend entire books (occasionally several) pining for each other until something forces one or both to admit their feelings. (See: F'lar and Lessa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonflight</a></em>, Afra and Damia in <em>Damia</em>, Sebell and Menolly in <em>Dragonsinger</em>) The most absurd example has to be in <em>Dragonsdawn</em>, where Tarvi didn't tell Telgar he loved her until she was about to die... and they had been married for years and had several children.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em>, Kvothe finds himself unable to tell Denna how he feels, at first out of mischance (and her frequent, frustrating absences), but later it is because he fears he has nothing to offer her, and that if he were to pursue a romantic relationship with her it will end badly, as most of her relationships apparently do. Instead of trying to work up the courage anyway, he ends the book as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> used this trope a lot. His character's justification was usually that they thought the other person already knew, or that they didn't realize the information was important. Unless it's love, in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> generally covers it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">A Princess of Mars</a></em>, although aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a>, Dejah Thoris is so offended by John Carter than she declares him unfit to clean the teeth of her grandmother's cat. Later, when he finds that she is crying, believing him dead, he talks with her companion, saying that Dejah Thoris is distressed that her grandmother's cat would have no one to clean its teeth.
</li><li> A character fighting alongside another for several days before realizing the other character is his long lost father (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">The Gods of Mars</a></em>).

This memory is considered very vital by Dumbledore for understanding Voldemort. However, it takes a potion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">felix felicis</a> to get the memory from him. Horace was unwilling to part with the proper version of events because he was horrified and ashamed of what he had done, believing he had done "great damage".
</li><li> And let's not forget <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, where the adults' unwillingness to tell Harry about his connection with Voldemort and all that it entails is largely responsible for Sirius's death.
</li><li> Snape doing this arguably sets off the entire story. After he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> calls Lily a "Mudblood" in a fit of anger, he tries to apologize, but Lily points out that he acts prejudiced towards all Muggleborns, asking flat-out, "Why should I be any different?"</span> Snape seems about to answer for a moment, but ultimately remains silent, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they break off their friendship</span>. This, of course, leads directly to Snape's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, which itself leads to Voldemort learning of the prophecy and trying to kill Harry as a child.
</li><li> Harry finds out in the last book that Dumbledore had been eaten up with self loathing for causing his sisters death for about a century. He let his brother Aberforth continue to (understandably) resent him for that long. Aberforth had just assumed he was able to move on with his life and become the best wizard of the era. Harry has to be the one to explain to Aberforth that he was never free from it all because he could never bring himself to apologize to Aberforth or tell him that he loved him and their sister.

Nobody who has has <em>any</em> sort of vital information about <em>anything</em> can reveal it straight away, either because they for various reasons Cannot Spit It Out or because they're interrupted by someone else arriving or something important happening. The single exception to this rule is Butch, a minor character from <em>The Lost Hero,</em> who at his first appearance explains exactly what's going on the moment he's asked.
</li><li> <em>American Wife</em> has one of the most tragic examples of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em>:

</li><li> Lilac and Aiden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfFearAndFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfFearAndFaith">Of Fear and Faith</a></em> fall for each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">immediately</a> but can't spit it out due to fear (of being rejected and getting attached, respectively). Aiden, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">naturally</a>, still flirts with Lilac and she eventually musters up the nerve to flirt back, but they both try to pretend they don't have deeper feelings.

It's the story about young Beatrice, who's bullied and pressured by her abusive and tyrannical uncle into an engagement with a man. A man who's not only like forty years older than her, but he also treats women like they're dirt under his shoes. So what does she do? Of course, she tells nobody the truth about why she agreed to marry this man (he would get her beautiful but weak cousin instead, if she didn't sacrifice herself). To be fair, she really is in a crappy situation, but still, yikes... And unfortunately, her love interest Seth is no better. Since he thinks that she willingly rejected him to marry an old disgusting aristocrat, stupid pride keeps him from admitting that he loves her. Several misunderstandings between them (sigh...) leads to much misery for them both (including that Beatrice gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brutally raped and battered on her wedding night</span>).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWolfInTheSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWolfInTheSoul">A Wolf in the Soul</a></em>, Greg can't summon up the courage to tell anybody about the weirdness happening around him for the entire first two-thirds of the book. He even blames others for not seeing the pain he's working so hard to keep under wraps. At least in the last third of the book he gets better, but he can still barely bring himself to tell the people from whom he's begging for help unless they tell him they already know he's a werewolf.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, the first thing Darcy says about Elizabeth is that she's not pretty enough to dance with (which she overhears). When she walks to Netherfield to visit her ill sister, his opinion of her starts to change, but he doesn't do anything beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongingLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongingLook">Longing Looks</a> until he tries to propose to her many months later, fully expecting that she was <em>hoping</em> for it. He did have a good reason for keeping his feelings quiet; as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">helpfully explains</a>, he was trying to reason himself out of wanting to connect himself with her inferior family. How odd, then, that she should refuse him! Of course, after Elizabeth's refusal, Darcy takes stock of himself based on her complaints about him and starts to shape up, becoming a much more polite and empathetic person. This causes Elizabeth to begin loving <em>him</em>, but feels incredibly awkward about it given how violently she refused him, and also feels guilty because half of the jerkish acts she accused him of weren't even true. So she says nothing to him about it, partly due to the awkward and partly because she feels like he couldn't possibly love her back after the crap she gave him. <em>Then</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lydia elopes with Wickham, exposing the Bennet family to potential, devastating shame which would make Darcy's marrying Elizabeth social suicide on his part</span>, and complicates it all even <em>further.</em>

<ul><li> Had Doran Martell told his plans to his nieces and daughter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he wants to help the remaining Targaryens reclaim the throne as their revenge against the Lannisters, then Myrcella wouldn't have lost an ear and Ser Arys Oakheart wouldn't have died which would have prevented Qyburn in providing Cersei's Kingsguard champion for her upcoming trial</span>. In fact, this is Doran's weakness which Ser Barristan Selmy acknowledged to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quentyn Martell</span> that had he revealed it earlier, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then Daenarys Targaryen wouldn't have stayed in Mereen and married to one of the nobles to stabilize the city, something which Quentyn came too late</span>.

</li><li> In a somewhat unusual example, Richard Dalloway from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginiaWoolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginiaWoolf">Virginia Woolf</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsDalloway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsDalloway">Mrs. Dalloway</a></em> has a terrible time working up the courage to tell his <em>wife</em> that he loves her! (She understands his feelings anyway, and reciprocates them.)
</li><li> The gay action series <em>Cut &amp; Run</em> by Madeleine Urban and Abigail Roux has this in spades, as befits a pair of troubled FBI tough guys who enjoy antagonizing each other almost as much as sex, and whose relationship is shaped by brutal, successive traumas. Ty (who's never been in love) and Zane (whose long-dead wife was the love of his life, or so he thought) can't manage to acknowledge to <em>themselves</em> that they're in love, much less to each other.

While it's pretty apparent that she suspects this and likes him in return, kisses, dates, hugs, or other intimate moments are usually interrupted by Tommy turning wolfy (caused by feelings of extreme emotion) and thus forcing him to run away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:

</li><li> In Season 3's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E7Revelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E7Revelations">Revelations</a>", Willow wants to admit something to Buffy—which gets interrupted by a fight. Then Willow lies to Buffy to avoid saying what's going on and it later nearly costs Willow her relationship with Oz. Could've saved a half a season's worth of relationship drama (and she helped break up Xander/Cordelia).
</li><li> Yet another example was Xander's crush on Buffy in the first season. It took the entire season before Buffy caught on to the blatant hints as well as Willow's crush on Xander.
</li><li> A different application of this trope occurs with the Spike/Buffy relationship in Season 6, which she conceals from the Scoobies because she's ashamed of it. Tara eventually finds out, but has to guess it from Buffy's expression. It's only when she says to her old flame Riley, "I'm sleeping with Spike," (even though he already knows, having caught them in bed together) that Buffy finds the courage to end their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance">Destructive Romance</a>. When the Scoobies find out after the event, they're shocked, but generally supportive as they know Buffy has been going through a rough time.
</li><li> Buffy herself admits she has a hard time saying "I love you" to <em>anyone</em>, likely due to how Angel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a> crushed her completely when she told him. The only other times she says it are to Dawn and to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spike right before he pulls his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>.

<ul><li> The titular character averts this pretty hard, since he seemingly can't <em>stop</em> telling Sarah about how he feels about her, even though their relationship is supposed to just be a cover. Sarah, on the other hand, plays it very straight for the first two-and-a-half seasons.
</li><li> Sarah seemingly rubs off on Chuck in early season 3. Because it seems like they could save themselves about a dozen episodes' worth of heartbreak if they just got together and had one honest talk. Instead, they seem to be airing out their problems to just about anybody but each other. And because Chuck has to hide his secret from his family and friends, he can't even give them the full disclosure.
</li></ul></li><li> A fairly dark example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>. The police arrive at Gail's house and she is annoyed at them for being there. They have a hard time breaking some news to her and she tells them to go ahead and "spit it out" so they can leave.

</li><li> Especially during the Twelfth Doctor era, the writers have had the Doctor use euphemistic statements instead of straight "I love you", with three major examples occurring in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E11DarkWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E11DarkWater">Dark Water</a>" (confirmed by the showrunner as meaning "I love you"), "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied">The Girl Who Died</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">Hell Bent</a>". Clara herself has done this herself with regards to the Doctor on a few occasions, using alternate wording rather than a straight ILY.
</li></ul></li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Everwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Everwood">Everwood</a></em>. One of the fundamental sources of Ephram's antagonism toward Andy is the latter's seemingly-inexplicable decision to uproot his family and move from New York to the eponymous little mountain town. We learn in episode 1 that Andy did it because his wife made him promise before she died. Ephram even points this out in the season finale after Andy finally tells him (after they've worked out their differences): "You know, this would have been a lot easier if you had told me straight away."
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> has an example with Simon and Kaylee. Simon is rather distracted with protecting his sister, while Kaylee is concerned by the class divide. It is the source of much UST until the end of the Movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>:
<ul><li> Niles spends seven years pining after Daphne, his father's physical therapist and (default) housekeeper (in fairness, he does spend much of that time married). Despite trying to confess his feelings to her several times, his attempts are continually thwarted (usually owing to his own fear of rejection or, unwittingly, by Daphne herself). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He remains unable to give voice to his emotions until the eve of Daphne's marriage to another man, and even then only after learning that Frasier has already let slip Niles's little "secret"</span>.
</li><li> In the final season of the series Frasier and Niles's father, Martin, displays a similar inability to confess his growing feelings for his girlfriend, Ronee.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ross doesn't tell Rachel he loves her for the entire first season, chickening out every time the opportunity arises. This has the unfortunate result of Rachel only finding out from Chandler while Ross is on a trip to China, and when she realizes she loves him too, he's already met someone else there. Rachel herself then falls victim to this. She spends a good few season 2 episodes being unable to confront Ross about her feelings. It takes a lot of wine and borrowing a stranger's cellphone to spit it out properly.
</li><li> Subverted when Joey developed feelings for Rachel. His hesitance was more due to her being pregnant with Ross's baby (though they were no longer together) and he eventually did work up the courage to tell her.
</li><li> Inverted with Chandler's feelings for Monica—he Can't Hold It In. They are actually together, but are <em>very</em> cautious in moving forward, and vaguely describe their relationship as "being on London time", "goofing around", and "two friends who just want to spend more time together". At one point, he blurts out that he loves her and freaks out.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Monica knows she loves Chandler but decisively holds off saying so until <em>he's</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues">ready</a>. A justified case of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: Sam, either because of his oath or his overall awkwardness, is unwilling to admit any romantic feeling for Gilly despite her less-than-subtle hints that his affection would be welcome.
</li><li> Almost every single thing that happens between Serena and Dan towards the end of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> could have been avoided if she had just told him about Georgina.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, Fonzie cannot bring himself to say "sorry" when he's done something wrong to someone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The second season could have been about fifteen minutes long if characters who were on reasonably cordial terms at the end of the first season a) remembered each other's phone numbers and b) bothered to discuss the, y'know, impending pestilent apocalypse with each other.
</li><li> The Mohinder/Bennet subplot was a particularly awful in this regard: Mohinder spends the entire season obsessing about the world-killing virus. Bennet waits until the second to last episode of the season, after their partnership has imploded and Mohinder has consequently <em>shot</em> him, to mention, "Oh yeah, the Company has been experimenting with that for decades."
</li><li> Season One has a number of more specific examples of this, with metahumans hiding their powers from others. Particularly notable are Nathan's constant lying to everyone about his flying (he doesn't even think to tell his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">invulnerable</a></em> <em>daughter</em> what he can do), and the half-dozen or so times Claire tries to tell her parents (or, as she later admits, "trying to not tell" them) about her healing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> Barney goes the entire fourth season without telling Robin he's in love with her, mainly because he's terrified she'll laugh him off because he's built such an infamous reputation as a shallow, womanizing sleazeball. He does tell Lily (who then tells Marshall) and Ted figures it out halfway through the season, but Lily and Marshall don't know Ted knows and vice versa, so all three of them sit on their hands in impatient silence for several months waiting for Barney to get a grip or Robin to get a clue.
</li><li> This also comes up in Seasons 7 and 8, again with Barney and Robin while they deny their feelings to themselves/everyone else, until they got together again.
</li><li> Back in Season 2 when Ted and Robin were dating, Robin tries to summon the courage to say "I love you" to Ted. She almost does, but at the last second, rather than uttering the three dreaded words, she blurts out "falafel".
</li></ul></li><li> The last two episodes of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster">Jeeves and Wooster</a></em> has Bertie making several attempts to get Gussie to confess his love for Madeline Bassett. The first time, Gussie loses it just a little and starts rambling on about newts at length until Madeline, who is actually <em>waiting</em> for him to confess his love, gets fed up and leaves.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em>, Gordo pines after Lizzie for the entire duration of the show. He nearly tells her several times, but falls victim to this trope. Lizzie ends up finding out from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Kate</a>, not Gordo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> finally gets them together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode where they all think Sawyer has Shannon's inhaler. If he just told everyone he didn't have it, there would have been no torture, but also no first Kate/Sawyer kiss...
</li><li> And then of course, the castaways ignore good advice that is spit out. Even by themselves. "Don't wander alone in the woods full of tree-smashing monster-thingies." Always good advice. But no...
</li><li> There is no character on <em>Lost</em> who is capable of completely summing up any event completely. They'll tell one mysterious event on an expedition, but will not tell the rest. They also never pull everyone at the crash site together to compare notes.
</li></ul></li><li> This drives most of the entire story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>. If Don Draper came clean about his "dark secret", then he would be able to straighten things out with his wife, stop looking over his shoulder generally, and would have saved his brother's life. Near the end of season three, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>does</em> come clean to Betty about it, but only after she forces his hand by finding out about much of it herself. At the end of the season, it looks like they're headed straight for a divorce</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, most of the problems presented in each episode could be quite easily solved by briefing King Arthur as to what is going on. Somewhat justified because Merlin's magical abilities have to be kept secret, and displaying his knowledge in certain situations could lead to suspicion being cast his way. Also, on the occasions when he <em>does</em> try to warn people about some imminent danger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">they generally refuse to believe him</a>—even though he has been proven right again and again.
</li><li> Doubled down in "Tableau Vivant", a third-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>. Phil can't bring himself to tell Mitchell, his brother-in-law, that he's fired as the new agency's lawyer. Mitchell can't bear to tell Phil that he really doesn't like the work, which is in addition to his regular job.
</li><li> One of the worst ongoing examples is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>; the title character has obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it's almost never mentioned, even when it would help. On one occasion, he shook hands with two white women, then a black guy, then asked his assistant for a wipe, like he frequently does. The black guy assumes Monk is racist, and explicitly asks him if he has any excuse. They tried to say Monk wasn't racist with Natalie saying "He loves Rainbows!" and Monk doing a rainbow-type of a hand motion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> has a skit called "Miss Annie Elk" wherein the title character experiences a prolonged coughing fit whenever she tries to tell the host her theory on a certain dinosaur. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">This being Monty Python, the theory isn't exactly earth-shattering.</a></span> It was also included in the Pythons' farewell special, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonMostlyLiveOneDownFiveToGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonMostlyLiveOneDownFiveToGo">Monty Python Live (Mostly): One Down, Five to Go</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em> does this with Jim and Pam, with Jim not revealing his feelings for Pam. In one episode, Jim has been jinxed into not speaking and Pam tries goading him into talking (and thus, losing the game): "It looks like you have something to say." Cue longing look that says more than words could. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He eventually spits it out in the season two finale.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, a number of times characters try to make confessions to others but are unable to finish.
<ul><li> David's unsuccessful attempt to confess to Kathryn that he and Mary Margaret were having an affair.
</li><li> Emma tries to take back her lie to Henry about how his father died, but can't bring herself to do it.

One would think that the perfect time to finally reveal that she's his daughter would be when he has her tied to a chair and is demanding, on pain of death, to know who she really is, but even then, she manages to spend the entire interrogation rambling, and doesn't blurt out the truth until he's already given the order to kill her and is seconds away from leaving the room (fortunately, he listens).

</li><li> "Everybody Knows (Except You)" by The Divine Comedy. The narrator can tell literally anyone about his feelings, and does (his parents, his friends to the point of driving them crazy, random strangers on the street and even making a small child cry) but he cannot bring himself to tell the one oblivious object of his affections.

Tragically, Haruki's song, "Goodbye, Our Mutual Unrequited Love" reveals that he actually feels the same way about Mio, but likewise was too scared to actually confess to her.

</li><li> Mothy's "60 Second Love" sung by Rin Kagamine is about a school girl who is in love with a boy who reads her bus, but can't bring herself to tell him.
</li><li> "To the Reticent You" by the above producer and singer is about a girl who wishes for her boyfriend to tell her he loves her so that she knows his love for her is true.

<ul><li> This pretty much sums up the entire relationship between the Red Panda and the Flying Squirrel. For all her flirtation, the Flying Squirrel can't bring herself to say what she feels. By the same token, the Red Panda can't voice his own feelings and he thinks the Squirrel is just kidding around. At the end of Season 3, everything comes out into the open when the Red Panda thinks the Squirrel's been killed and plants a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKiss">"Shut Up" Kiss</a> on her when she reveals she's alive. Season four's intro proceeds to introduce the Flying Squirrel as the Red Panda's fiance, and season five onward introduces her as his wife.
</li><li> In the season three episode "The Terrible Two", supervillains the Mad Monkey and Jackrabbit team up. Upon capture, the two declare their love for one another, the Mad Monkey even forgoing his chance to escape since he can't do it without leaving her.

The Princess's evil aunt places a spell on her where she is unable to speak straight. Despite trying her hardest to explain that "Tant Aminella" (Aunt Taminella) is the evil witch, no one catches on.

Her inability to do so earns Cloud a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> at the hands of Sephiroth, which Tifa has to fix in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">Journey to the Center of the Mind</a>, after the damage has been done</span>.
</li><li> On another note, Tifa's inability to tell Cloud her feelings for him is a definite Cannot Spit It Out as well.

He shows interest in a female Shepard early on, but has difficulty spelling it out. The third game revealed that he had an even harder time spitting it out if Shepard is a man. Shepard being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> did not help. Shepard can call him on it, too:

If you attempt to inform your teammates to prevent the sabotage, the shuttle you're on suddenly hits turbulence and interrupts you, making it look like a straight example of this trope. You're given a second chance a couple of combat sequences later, and a third chance (to tell Mordin / Padok specifically) right before the curse is released.

Of course, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">androphobia</a> didn't exactly help...

<ul><li> Of course, this is entirely in-keeping with drow culture.

</li><li> Shandra's severe embarrassment when Grobnar inadvertently reveals her extreme concern for the PC's fate before said duel also probably qualifies her for this.
</li><li> Nathyrra in the original game has a bit of trouble with this.

She never takes the opportunity to tell Kotonoha that she's dating Makoto even though Kotonoha is one of the girls nice enough to instantly back off if her crush is taken. She also won't tell Makoto that the new substitute manager at Radish is her father, not her ex boyfriend. While Makoto's reaction is way overboard and rather dickish, the whole problem could have been resolved if she could just say four simple words: "Shun is my dad."

Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> Fluttershy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">quickly growing tired of the unwanted attention that comes with fame</a>, but trying not to show it because she thinks Rarity would be disappointed if she gave up. Both of them confide to Twilight Sparkle... but unfortunately for everyone involved they make Twilight swear to secrecy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingSecretsSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingSecretsSucks">Twilight promptly drives herself crazy trying to keep their respective secrets</a> even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">it would save everyone a lot of trouble</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">if she</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">didn't</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">keep said secrets</a>.
</li><li> Another example: from 'A Bird In The Hoof', Princess Celestia meets Twilight's friends for the first time in person. She's been told about them and what they do. When Fluttershy is introduced to Philomeena, Celestia merely asks Fluttershy "Isn't she lovely?" Cue the bird losing a few feathers off of her already near-featherless body and making a horrible hacking cough as though she's dying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(She is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">She gets better</a>.)</span>. Long story short, the entire episode could have been skipped if Celestia had simply thought to mention to Fluttershy that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Philomeena is a phoenix.</span>
