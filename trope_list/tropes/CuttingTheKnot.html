So she simply busts the oxygen tank to fill the cockpit with oxygen. Roger asks why she couldn't have been more gentle, such as using mouth to mouth (he wouldn't have asked that if he knew how small her internal tank was, apparently). She responds that the water displacement was quicker and far more effective by bursting the tank anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>: When Sakura, Syaoran and Tomoyo are trapped inside The Maze. Even after using other Clow Cards to cheat their way out, the group doesn't manage to do anything, until they meet their teacher Kaho Mizuki. She shows she has a special bell that is the way out of the maze: it can destroy the walls and create a path out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> To advance through part of the Hunter Exam, Gon is given the choice of two candles by his opponents, and they compete to keep theirs burning for the longest. After some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">I Know You Know I Know</a>, Gon ends up with the much faster-burning candle, but just uses the bigger flame to freely move around without fear of his candle getting blown out by the wind and blows out the other one.
</li><li> Later in the same arc, the group is confronted with two doors: one leads to a short path to the exit, but only allows three people from the group of five to pass, while the other has a long path (and will take too long for them to get to the exit in time, which will result in all of them failing the test) but will allow them all. Either some can make it, or no one? They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">take the third option</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cy2k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0cy2k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cy2k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The examiners were very prepared, having every weapon under the sun in the room. When fighting starts, Gon then notices that the weapons are able to damage the floor and concludes that they can be used to get through the walls.</span> They entered the long and difficult path, then cut a hole in the wall, to sneak in the short and easy path. It takes a lot of effort, but it's faster than the long passage would have been.
</li><li> Gon beats a guy who rotated super-fast to defend himself by ripping the floor out from under him.
</li><li> Gon and Killua are locked in a room with Nobunaga, who, if they try to escape using the room's one door, will kill them instantly. They know for sure that there's no way that they can defeat Nobunaga, and he will not move from the door. How do they escape? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">They bash in the wall opposite the door with one hit,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">and then run like hell.</a> He follows them, so they destroy half a dozen of walls, backtrack to the one before the last and simply use the door to exit the building while he is searching the last room.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em>, Okuyasu needed to quickly find out which of the two sailors is about to assassinate Joseph Joestar. However, he had little evidence and is rather dim-witted. His solution? Punch both and ask questions later. Thankfully he got the correct one on the first try.
</li><li> Ryuko's battle with Inumuta during the Naturals Election in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> ends with this, as Ryuko defeats an invisible Inumata not by sussing out his location but by transforming part of her suit into a giant flyswatter and hitting the whole arena at once, flattening him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em> has Nanoha's famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypass</a> to take out Quattro. So much for a ship full of super defenses, eh?
</li><li> In a two-parter from the 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> anime titled "The World's Strongest Robot", the mighty robot Pluto faces off against the German robot Gerhardt. Pluto's brute size and strength are useless against Gerhardt, as he is much smaller and nimbler. The massive horns on his head are too unwieldy to stab him, too, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">the electric current they emit is rendered useless by the special alloy that composes Gerhardt's body</a>. So what does Pluto do when Gerhardt grabs onto his horns to mock him? Tug on his horns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">split Gerhardt down the middle</a>. He then makes sure to bend his horns back into place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mouse">Mouse</a></em>, one ancient challenge was to figure out how to untie this extremely hard knot. Alexander the Great solved it by simply cutting it. So to make the next one more challenging, they made the second knot out of metal chains.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhiBrainPuzzleOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhiBrainPuzzleOfGod">Phi Brain: Puzzle of God</a></em>, Daimon Kaito is trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Fool's Puzzle</a> in the form of a burning tower. Ideally, he would use a maze of elevators to reach the top where the goal is, but the flames have risen high enough to block the route. His solution is to break off the door of one of the elevators so that he can jump off when it passes a floor that <em>will</em> let him take the route to the goal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> How Shizuo solves every one of his problems. Tangled and complicated schemes involving mafia and set-ups and supernatural creatures? It must be time to beat Izaya's face in again. Problem solved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode where the main characters are doing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyEscape">Indy Escape</a>. When they run out of places to... well, run, Honda/Tristan turns around and punches the boulder as it's about to crush them. It pops. Turns out it was a balloon with a speaker inside.
</li><li> Also, the episode in which Kaiba literally crashes Pegasus' mainframe—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">he smashes it with a satellite</a>. Subverted in the original Japanese version, where he takes over the satellite via a back door into its programming, and then uses it to hack the mainframe.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters">Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters</a></em>, the gang gets trapped in a maze and struggle to navigate their way through — until Tristan acquires a monster (Shovel Crusher) that smashes its way through the walls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> does this frequently, in order to make the characters actions more realistic. Emotional duelists usually use their fists first unless they're already engaged in a duel. The crazy possessed guy using card games to seal souls gets physically held down and away from his deck until he recovers. Duelists will research their opponent if the duel is pre-determined to build a deck specifically for the duel. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the corrupt Security call in for backup when the people they're trying to arrest beat them in a duel, and build road blocks to stop them from escaping</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> has a few examples. Ironically, of all characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>, in spite of both being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> and going around with the chariot that <em>has</em> the Gordian Knot, never does it:
<ul><li> Kayneth Archibald had rented most of a hotel and, for defense, filled it with magical traps, demons, gateways that open into other dimensions, and the likes. Kiritsugu just blew up the unprotected bottom floors and brought the whole thing down, with Kayneth still inside.
</li><li> That was part of another attempt at this: Saber's arm had been wounded by Lancer with a cursed weapon, so they could have made a few attempts at fighting a powerful curse...

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> example of this trope would probably have to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Heracles</a> (his legends date back to 600 BC, three hundred years before the trope naming legend, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> figured heavily). When met with a lion whose skin could not be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">pierced</a></em> with any blade or point, he <em>bludgeoned</em> it to death (or <em>strangled</em> it, depending on the translation). Later, when charged to wash out a massive set of stables in a very short time, he lifted up a river and washed them all out at once. Later still, he was told to go into the underworld to defeat and abduct Cerberus. Instead, he <em>quite literally</em> explains his situation to Hades and asks if he can borrow his dog for a while. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">Being one of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">the more decent gods</a>, Hades basically said "just bring him back when you're done" (other versions have Hades also require Heracles overpower Cerberus without "shield or iron" to leave with him, though Heracles asking first remains doubtlessly easier and more straightforward than trying to steal away an unwilling Cerberus out of the underworld without Hades' permission).
<ul><li> When Heracles felt that he offended a friend by being rowdy during his wife's funeral that was kept secret from him, he decided that the best way to make it up was to go off and bring the lady back to life by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath">wrestling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Thanatos</a> for her. Sure enough, before the end of the night, he came marching back to the house with the mans wife in his arms.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMakers">Trope Maker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> was the mythical, impossibly complex <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot">Gordian Knot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that, the oracles predicted, could only be untied by the future king of Asia. Alexander the Great tried in vain to untie it and then, when that didn't work, simply drew his sword and sliced it in two. Other versions of the story are the exact opposite of the trope, however, with Alexander finding a clever way to untie the knot without cutting it, like where he basically removes the main object that the knot was apparently wrapped around, thus loosening its entire structure; the equivalent of leveling a building by removing its foundation. By the ancient Greek definition of Asia, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia">he did indeed conquer all of it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Alexander's unorthodox strategy was technically allowed thanks to the wording of the prophecy. The Greek word used for "untie", actually meant "loosen". As cutting the knot, or for that matter removing the object it was tied around, does indeed loosen it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">the prophecy was technically fulfilled</a>. But one must imagine facepalms all around.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse legend</a>, a man once gambled with a giant, and wagered his son. Predictably, the man lost, and the giant gave him a day to forfeit the boy, lest the giant simply kill him and his whole family. The man pleaded with Odin of the Aesir to save his son: Odin did this by hiding the boy from the giant by transforming him into a feather on the head of a swan. The giant caught the swan and in the middle of plucking it bald, the boy ran away. The man then went to a second Aesir, Hönir, to save his son, which he did by transforming the boy into a grain hidden in a field of wheat. The giant found the specific plant, and in the middle of counting out the individual seeds, the boy again escaped him. Finally, the man pleaded with Loki of the Aesir to save his son. Rather than rely on similar sorcerous gimmicks to trick the giant, Loki simply took the boy, and challenged the giant to come and get the boy if he still dared, whereupon the giant then promptly fell dead into the booby trap Loki set specifically for him (although in some versions, Loki did try it first by transforming the boy into an egg in the roe of a shad fish and only resorted to the trap when it failed).

<ul><li> Airport security agents keep a set of bolt cutters, a large flathead screwdriver, and a mallet at each inspection station to force any locked bag open. The bolt cutters are nicknamed "the master key" because it will open any lock <em>and</em> render said lock unable to be reused (which may be a bug or a feature, depending on the nature of the lock that needs to be gone).
</li><li> The quickest way to disarm a nuclear weapon is <em>to blow it up</em>. While this is incredibly counter-intuitive, it is in fact a fool-proof method. Nuclear weapons are dependent upon the extremely precise detonation of a series of high-explosive plates within the mechanism within a fraction of a second. So if just one plate goes off too early, the chain-reaction will fail and a full-yield detonation won't occur. In fact, the resultant explosion may be barely, if at all, larger than that caused by the high explosives used within the mechanism alone. While it will of course still spray the (radioactive) uranium and/or plutonium across the landscape, most would consider this an acceptable trade-off for not being nuked.
<ul><li> Also works for conventional explosives as well. Skilled bombmakers will include all sorts of intricate anti-tampering mechanisms to prevent the warhead being disarmed, but firing a .50-calibre bullet through the timer almost never fails; at worst you'll set the thing off prematurely, but if you know the bomb's there then you can clear the blast radius before the EOD team arrive.
</li></ul></li><li> In the military, when opening a door in or around a combat zone that has not been previously entered, one must first check for booby traps, then carefully open the door, checking it for traps along the way— unless there is any chance whatsoever of a hostile inside the room, in which case you blow the hinges to hell with 12 gauge slugs or C4, then kick the door the rest of the way down. Incidentally, there is an under-slung shotgun attachment for the M-16 and M-4, known as the "Masterkey", marketed for this express purpose.
<ul><li> Additionally, rather than clearing a building full of hostiles, it's usually recommended to simply throw in a satchel charge, or call in an artillery/air strike from a safe distance. Of course, you <em>could</em> look for traps, blow the door, get shot at by ambushing hostiles, evacuate your wounded and send some other guys in, look for traps some more, check every single room in the building for more hostiles...but unless the enemy has hostages, or you need someone or something in there intact, blowing it up without ever placing your foot in the door is much easier and safer (at least for the would be breachers).
</li><li> Soldiers fighting in the Battle of Falujah found that, instead of attacking an enemy building by clearing it with infantry, throwing a large enough block of C4 in the front door would kill everyone inside. Barring that, so long as the occupants don't have a clear line of fire at you through a window, simply blocking the door of an enemy bolthole can instantly turn a nigh-impregnable bunker into a prison. Come back every now and then to check if they're out of water or their toilets have overflowed. Either way, they'll most likely be ready to deal.
</li><li> One particular Fallujah incident involved a three-story apartment block loaded with enemies and full of booby traps waiting to catch soldiers as they went inside, leaving the enemy safe to engage soldiers outside from the numerous upper-level windows and balconies. The enemy were not counting on a nearby tank simply firing its main gun through the walls...which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">set off all the booby-traps inside</a> and <em>completely destroyed the entire building.</em>
</li><li> If you <em>must</em> enter the building, but know that approaching the door is too dangerous, you can always just use explosives to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">Dynamic Entry</a> by blasting a man-sized hole in a wall to catch them by surprise. Extensive use of this in urban warfare is known as "Mouseholing".
</li><li> This also applies to other walls and hedge rows as well, especially for tanks. It's common knowledge that the weakest parts of a tank's armor is the sides or rear, and the best thing for infantry to do is simply hide and wait for the tank to pass and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">shoot an RPG up the tail pipe.</a> However, any competent Tank Commander will simply use his tank as a 60 -on battering ram, and burst through any obstacles in his path, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">crushing any would-be ambushers in their path.</a> Tanks fitted with dozer blades and mine plows are especially good for this, as the latter can give the semi-gratifying end to anti-tank troops by turning them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">human hood ornaments.</a> This method saves on ammo, which is also important.
</li></ul></li><li> In computer security, there are two ways to prevent a computer from being attacked and taken over via a network: (1) hideously complex Intrusion Detection Systems, firewalls, and meticulously written firewall rules, or (2) not plugging the thing into the network.
<ul><li> Which is exactly how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em> began...
</li><li> A prime example of this was related in Kevin Mitnick's <em>The Art Of Deception</em>: in his younger days (when he was already a notorious hacker) he visited an IT conference where some company was demonstrating a network security solution. They were so convinced it was unbeatable that they dared people to hack it (specifically access the protected server via the public terminal in the showroom) and promised a cash prize to whoever did. The reps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">were so confident</a> that they not only had the money bills pinned to their shirts, but also provided a list of usernames and passwords for privileged accounts (which were useless since the terminal was set up to only allow non-privileged accounts to log in). Mitnick won by...distracting the sales rep while his associate picked the lock to the server room and plugged the cable connected to the public terminal to a port that allowed privileged access (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">the port list was left in the cabinet</a>), then logged in via the account provided by the devs. Which turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>, since not only did the reps for some reason <em>leave the program's source code saved in the server</em> (which Mitnick then started <em>printing</em>), but the cash was most of the money the reps had, forcing them to stop by the bank.
</li><li> Also, <a class="urllink" href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Super-Hacker.aspx">the super hacker.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Most hackers who defeat malware for a living employ solutions that revolve around this trope. One of the simplest methods to defeat malware is to simply wipe the hard drive and start over. If you have stuff on the drive you need, boot from a flash drive or CD, thus circumventing the malware.
</li><li> And of course, if you're breaking INTO a computer system, you could exploit known security holes using complex methods, attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering">"phish"</a> the password out of a user...or just write a program to try every possible combination of letters and numbers that could make up the password (starting with the most common) as fast as possible and let it run for a few hours. This latter method is known as "brute-forcing".
<ul><li> Brute force attacks are not really practical in general. Adding most-likely-first logic will be very complex and time-consuming for all but the simplest common cases. And except for very badly chosen passwords (assuming you do take the time to include that logic in your code), it will likely take much, much more than "a few hours" to run. Most login codes will have a throttle to force a delay of a second or so between attempts, and/or a longer delay after a handful of failed attempts. Even with only digits and upper and lower case letters, and only a six-character password, there are still over 50,000,000,000 possible combinations. At one attempt per second, that's about 900 years on average.
</li></ul></li><li> For a different kind of brute force, there's always "rubber hose cryptanalysis", in which you bypass all the software/hardware troubles and just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">beat the passwords out of everyone involved.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> During the last Hubble Space Telescope <a class="urllink" href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a24509/a-view-of-earth/">servicing mission,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> several bolts on the telescope were found to be vacuum-welded, meaning that support struts that had been needed when the observatory was first launched now formed a block to replacing the broken instruments. After two hours of deliberation, the following advice came from Mission Control: "Pull on them. If that doesn't work, pull harder".
</li><li> Whoever was the first player of the Rubik's Cube that figured out how to pull it apart and rearrange the colors so it was "solved" proverbially cut the Gordian Rubik's Cube.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69ddl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note69ddl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69ddl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You have to jam it mid-turn and then force another turn for it to fall apart, though this is easier with cheap cubes.</span>
<ul><li> In the version with colored stickers, pulling them off and then rearranging them in the desired manner works just as well (at least as long as the sticky part holds up, or else, use glue).
</li></ul></li><li> According to Cognitive Psychology, compared with people with high attention spans who may try to come up with increasingly complex solutions, people with short attention spans are usually able to see simple answers to problems because they're able to notice their immediate surroundings.
</li><li> A tortoise is a rather tricky creature to eat, due to its hard shell. When it retreats into it, it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>, and most animals just can't pull out the meaty bits due to a lack of dexterity or due to the protective plates that come up to cover the holes for the tortoise's head, legs and tail. The eagle and the hyena get around this problem, the former by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">simply picking up and dropping the tortoise from high up over rocks</a>, the latter by biting it with its incredible bite force.
<ul><li> Large alligators solve the problem by swallowing turtles whole, then digesting them shell and all.
</li><li> The solution early humans discovered was simply to stick it in the fire or boil it with the shell, letting the heat break down the shell for them, then tearing open the softened shell.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1417, the city of Florence held a contest to decide which architect would be contracted to build the dome of Florence Cathedral. Filippo Brunelleschi, one of the contestants, challenged his rivals to stand an egg on a flat marble surface; if they couldn't do it and he could, they agreed to withdraw from the contest. When none of the others could manage it, Filippo took his egg, smashed one end of it and stood it on the smashed end, winning the contract.
</li><li> Sheds can be broken into quietly by simply removing the entire door, or even better, the latch that the lock is on. Since sheds are meant for storage, they typically have the hinges on the outside to allow the door to swing out. As an added bonus, it looks like you are merely performing maintenance on the shed until you start hauling stuff out.
</li><li> A tactic occasionally used to break into safes is to just steal the safe itself and open it at one's leisure.
<ul><li> Does not work so well with ATM's, simply due to the fact that they are designed so that the only way to open them is to literally blow them apart, destroying the ATM and all the money inside... unless you happened to steal or copy the key beforehand.
<ul><li> Or simply <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204594/ATM-gang-stole-700-000-using-circular-saws-cut-way-dozens-supermarkets-Britain.html">saw the door open<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Not much can't be done with enough application of brute force.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the easiest way to open a safe is with a crowbar and a hammer. A lot of Storage Liquidators would rather find the key, however, as the safes themselves might be worth money (which sometimes can be more than the possible content they hold).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Marvelman</em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman">Miracleman</a></em> stayed out of print for over twenty years due to numerous legal battles over who held the rights. During a trial concerning several intellectual property disputes between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> and Todd McFarlane it came out in testimony that the editor of Warrior magazine never actually held the rights to the character; he only found that they were held by the state as part of a bankruptcy deal, so it was unlikely that anyone was going to sue them for publishing a new series. Therefore the rights which everyone was fighting over didn't even exist. Marvel went and bought the real rights to Marvelman and ended the legal battle.
<ul><li> It should be noted that this lawsuit started in the first place because of ownership disputes between McFarlane and characters that Gaiman had created for <em>Spawn</em>, particularly the character Angela. McFarlane hoped to use the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman">Miracleman</a></em> rights (which Gaiman had been spending years to try to re-acquire in full so he could finish the story) as a bargaining chip. Once it was revealed McFarlane was essentially bluffing with an empty hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">the judge awarded Gaiman the full rights to Angela</a>, which he then promptly sold to Marvel as part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Miracleman">Miracleman</a></em> deal to be a new character in <em>Thor</em>. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">it's a safe bet Angela</a> will never appear in a <em>Spawn</em> comic ever again.
