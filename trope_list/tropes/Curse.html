They served as warnings to listeners against defying morality or doing the taboo, for fear of angering the gods and incurring some terrible punishment. What might bring down a curse? It depends entirely on the story. Eating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a>, crossing that bridge after midnight, speaking out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a> or even unkindness to strangers can trigger a curse.
</p><p>The curser might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">petty</a> god, a witch, or even a normal person driven to great anger. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordPower">Words</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic">Language</a> have power, especially spoken from the heart. Doubly so if the heart is filled with bitter rage. Triply so if the person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords">dying</a>. But even in ordinary circumstances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouSay">Be Careful What You Say</a>, or you may well cast a curse on a loved one. For that matter, if you make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise">The Promise</a> and say, "May [curse] fall on me if I fail!" you can curse yourself. Or the curse might not be cast by anyone at all, it may well be a 'maliceless' effect of breaking some taboo. And there's no guarantee that the cursed person is the offender; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse">Hereditary Curse</a> may steadily descend through a family.

Otherwise — and sometimes even when it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> — curses are the very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">darkest</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a>.
</p><p>The effect of the curse on a character and story is that of a potent driving force. Getting rid of it can drive a character to do great and terrible things. Enduring one can add drama and complicate a hero's life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseIsFoiledAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseIsFoiledAgain">Resolving it</a> is cause for a satisfying resolution.

</p><p>Curses can come in all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">shapes and sizes</a>. Common curses include:
</p><ul><li> Bad luck, sometimes in the form of an actual "cloud" of misfortune following them.
</li><li> A physical defect like BO, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">Involuntary Shapeshifting</a> (and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyToBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyToBeast">ugliness</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">clumsiness.</a>
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">Wound That Will Not Heal</a>. (A milder form is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever">scar</a> immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> or other healing magic.)

This may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateAndProphecyTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateAndProphecyTropes">prophecy</a>, if the curse is merely a cruel but accurate divination.
</li><li> To become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment">The Punishment</a>; an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpawnBroodling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpawnBroodling">inhuman monster</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouMonstrous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouMonstrous">wracked with suffering</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">extends that suffering</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation">anyone they can.</a>
</li><li> The curse may Include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTied">Tongue-Tied</a> clause that prevents the cursed character from saying they're cursed to make it more difficult to remove.
</li><li> If you're a sports fan it means your sports team is forever doomed to not win a championship.
</li></ul><p>Curses can also be put on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath">inanimate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfAttraction">objects</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedItem">swords</a>, and places, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse">houses</a> and lands. Places tend to turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a> under curses, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSmellsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSmellsBad">smell bad</a>, and both places and objects inflict bad things on the people about, or owning, them.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurseEscapeClause">Curses can be cut short</a> by:
</p><ul><li> Giving back a stolen item, apologizing, or otherwise setting right the original offense.
</li><li> Completing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">Impossible Task</a>.
</li><li> Dying and coming back, usually as part of finding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalLoophole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalLoophole">loophole</a> in the curse.
</li><li> Passing it on to someone else, like a bad penny.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. Sometimes this simply requires actually being loved by someone else, sometimes it requires the person to receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">True Love's Kiss</a> to seal the deal. Furthermore, many curses are susceptible to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">Power of Love</a> even if it's not supposed to be a condition of the curse.
</li></ul><p>For some reason, a curse that turns you into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">a member of the opposite sex</a> is <em>particularly</em> hard to break, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending">doubly so if you were a man</a>.

Arguably, just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">living in Midland</a></em> itself qualifies as a living curse.

It appears that her <em>remembering</em> that she is cursed is a key in the curse maintaining its effects. That, or her self-esteem issues. Whenever she appears more confident, she grows younger. When she goes back to being shy, she ages up. The book the film is adapted from features the same curse, which Howl attempts to secretly break on his own but discovers Sophie is unconsciously retaining on herself. Later, her concern for an injured Howl overcomes her shyness and the curse finally lifts.

<ul><li> A farmer who asked for a large pile of expensive cloth to sell so his family could make it through a harsh winter. His curse was to see the world upside down for the rest of his life; it was weird, but he got used to it.

</li><li> Dalinar doesn't remember exactly what he asked for, but the result was that he lost all memories of his wife, to the point that he can't even hear her name when it is spoken.

Athletes and sports fans are often a superstitious bunch, so if there's a long drought of success or a string of near-misses (especially those under odd circumstances), sports curses often come about. Here's some notable ones:
<p></p><h2>Multiple Sports</h2>
<ul><li> The city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and the Curse of Billy Penn. Philadelphia's City Hall is topped by a statue of William Penn (the founder of both the city and the entire colony-now-state of Pennsylvania), and for many decades there was a gentleman's agreement in place that didn't allow any building in the city to be higher than it. This agreement was broken in March 1987 by the opening of One Liberty Place three blocks away. Before then, all four of Philadelphia's major sports franchises had seen a good deal of recent success: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">the Phillies</a> had won the World Series in 1980 and had also clinched the NL Pennant in 1983 (if this doesn't seem like a lot, consider that the club predates the first World Series (1903) by twenty years and 1980 was their first World Series victory <em>ever</em> ); <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">the 76ers</a> had swept the Los Angeles Lakers to win the 1983 NBA Finals and also made the Finals in '77, '80, and '82; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">the Eagles</a> reached Super Bowl XV in 1980 before losing to the Oakland Raiders (a big deal for a team whose last NFL title was in 1960); <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">the Flyers</a> had won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and '75, as well as appearing in the Finals in '76, '80, and '85. Once the new skyscraper opened and the statue of Penn was overshadowed, none of these teams won a championship despite some close calls:
<ul><li> The Phillies lost the 1993 World Series in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays on Joe Carter's three-run walkoff homer.
</li><li> The 76ers lost to the Lakers in 2001 in five games (admittedly, they were big underdogs in that series).
</li><li> The Eagles probably had the most agonizing time - they lost the NFC Championship Game three years in a row (2002 to the St. Louis Rams, 2003 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2004 to the Carolina Panthers)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vobw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vobw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vobw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The 2003 and 2004 NFC Championship Game losses came with the Eagles at home - since the NFL started giving playoff home-field advantage to teams with better records, no other team has ever lost back-to-back Conference Championship games where they hosted</span> before finally beating the Atlanta Falcons in 2005 and reaching Super Bowl XXXIX...where they lost to the New England Patriots.
</li><li> The Flyers lost the Stanley Cup Finals to the Edmonton Oilers just two months after One Liberty Place opened. They also got swept by the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 after cruising through the first three rounds that year. They also made the Conference Finals five times (1989, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2008) before losing - 2000 especially stands out because the Flyers were up 3-1 in the best-of-seven series before dropping Games 5, 6, and 7 to the New Jersey Devils. <br/><br/>How did this end? In June 2007 the final beam of the new Comcast Center in downtown Philadelphia was erected, becoming the tallest building in the city. Workers planted a two-foot-high figure of William Penn to that beam, along with a tree and an old-school American flag. The figurine got stolen and a replacement one was quickly provided — sports in Philadelphia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">is a very big deal</a>. Forward to October 2008, and the Phillies win the World Series in five games against the Tampa Bay Rays.
</li></ul></li><li> For the latter half of the 20th Century and into the 21st, the city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a> became the pro sports world's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> for their lack of championships and procession of near-misses that border on the cruel. After the Cleveland Browns' 1964 NFL Championship win, Cleveland sports franchises (counting the Big Four members of baseball's Indians, basketball's Cavaliers, football's Browns, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">two seasons of hockey's Barons</a> before they folded and were absorbed by the Minnesota North Stars) endured a combined 147 seasons without a championship, the longest out of any North American city with a team in the Big Four sports. The disappointments are so numerous many are referred to by two-word titles starting with "The".
<ul><li> The Cleveland Indians' woes actually predate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, as their last AL pennant was in 1954 and their last World Series win was in 1948. Terry Pluto, who covered the Indians for <em>The Plain Dealer</em>, theorized The Curse of Rocky Colavito as for why the team was so consistently inept, stemming from the trading away of fan favorite right fielder Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers in early 1960. Since then, the Indians were constant basement-dwellers, never finishing less than 11 games out of first place. After his book was published in 1994, the Indians started to get good...only to move from perennial loser to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">Every Year They Fizzle Out</a> land:
<ul><li> The '94 season saw the Indians within 1 game of the Chicago White Sox for first place in the AL Central when the players' strike prematurely ended it, but it set up an even better 1995 season where the Indians made it all the way to the World Series for the first time since 1954 before losing in six games to the Atlanta Braves, including being held to one hit in the deciding Game 6 that ended 1-0. While these Braves were in the midst of an unprecedented 14-season streak of division titles, this would be the <em>only</em> year in that streak that the Braves actually won a World Series.
</li><li> The Indians returned to the World Series in 1997, this time facing off against a wild card Florida Marlins team that six years ago didn't even exist. The Series went seven games with the Indians holding a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the 9th of Game 7 in Miami, but closer Jose Mesa couldn't hang on to the lead and the Marlins tied it on a Craig Counsell sacrifice fly to right. Then in the 11th, the Indians, now with Charles Nagy on the mound, got it to two outs but Marlins had the bases loaded when Edgar Renteria managed to line-drive Nagy's pitch back at him, the ball just glancing off Nagy's glove and over second base into the outfield for the Series-winning single.
</li><li> The Indians still remained at the top of the AL Central and returned to the postseason in 1998, only to blow a 2-1 series lead to the New York Yankees in the ALCS. They got back in 1999, only to blow a 2-0 series lead to the Boston Red Sox in the ALDS. They got back in 2001, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">only to blow a 2-1 series lead to the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS</a>.
</li><li> 2007: Up three games to one on the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS with Cy Young winner CC Sabathia going for them at home in Game 5, the Red Sox instead blow the Indians out of the water in Games 5, 6, and 7 by a combined score of 30-5 in those three games.
</li><li> The Indians' choking woes didn't stop even after the Cavaliers broke the citywide drought: they lost the "Hell Freezes Over" 2016 World Series to the Chicago Cubs in an extra innings Game 7 at home, and blew a 2-0 series lead in the best-of-five 2017 ALDS to the Yankees.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cleveland Browns' woes are sometimes said to stretch all the way back to when Art Modell purchased the then-successful team in 1961 and the shoddy treatment of coach Paul Brown, whom the team was <em>named after</em>. Basically, Art Modell fired Brown in 1963 and the last championship for the city of Cleveland in any major sport happened the year afterward. Brown would go on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">found the Cincinnati Bengals</a> (whose stadium is named after him).
<ul><li> Jan 4, 1981: AFC Divisional playoffs, Browns are down 14-12 to the Oakland Raiders with less than a minute but have the ball on second down and are on the Raiders' 13-yard line, well within field goal range. Coach Sam Rutigliano called "Red Slot Right, Halfback Stay, 88" and told quarterback Brian Sipe to "throw it into Lake Erie" if the play wasn't wide open. The primary receiver Dave Logan <em>was</em> open but Sipe didn't see him and instead tried to force a pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome, which got intercepted and the Browns lose the game on "Red Right 88". The Raiders went on to win the Super Bowl that year.
</li><li> Jan 11, 1987: AFC Championship Game, Browns are up 20-13 against the Denver Broncos with 5:32 left in the fourth quarter after a 48-yard touchdown pass from Bernie Kosar and the ensuing kickoff left the Broncos stuck at their own 2-yard line. Broncos quarterback John Elway then orchestrated "The Drive", a 15-play, 98-yard series that ended with the game-tying touchdown with 39 seconds left; the Broncos would win the game 23-20 in overtime.
</li><li> Jan 17, 1988: Rematch of the previous year's AFC Championship Game, this time in Denver. The Browns fell behind early but was able to catch up in the second half, tying the score at 31. The Broncos scored another touchdown to make it 38-31 with six minutes left, but the Browns put together a solid drive to get to the Broncos' 8-yard-line with 1:12 left. Running back Earnest Byner, who had come alive for the Browns' offense and had been running roughshod over the Broncos defense, took the handoff on a draw play and ran to the outside with space, only needing to beat Broncos defensive back Jeremiah Castille to score the tying touchdown. Castille went for the strip and forced "The Fumble" at the one yard line and recovered the ball for the Broncos, who gave the Browns an intentional safety and won the game 38-33.
</li><li> By the 1990's, the Browns' Cleveland Stadium was showing its age and the City of Cleveland voted to approve the Gateway Project that gave new arenas to the Indians (Jacobs Field) and Cavaliers (Gund Arena). Modell had previously purchased Cleveland Stadium from the city in 1975 due to the city's financial problems and initially didn't participate in the Gateway Project because he didn't think his revenue stream was in jeopardy when it fact it very much was once the Indians left the stadium as tenants in 1994 and revenues crashed. Meanwhile, the team itself under coach Bill Belichick made the playoffs with an 11-5 record and won a playoff game and was a trendy pick to win their first Super Bowl the following season. The team started the 1995 season at 3-1 before muddling to a 4-5 record when Modell announced in November that the team would be moved to Baltimore the following season. Fans were outraged, and the team itself utterly collapsed at the morale blow to a 5-11 finish. After much lawsuit-wrangling it was agreed that, officially, the Cleveland Browns would suspend operations until the city built a new stadium while Modell's franchise moving to Baltimore would officially be an expansion team even though they had the old Browns' players and staff. Modell's name became an invective to be scorned in Northeast Ohio — though he sold the team in 2000 he never returned to Cleveland, and after he died in 2012 the new Browns elected not to commemorate his death at the request of Art's stepson David out of fear the fans would just boo and disrespect him (not that it stopped that anyway — a YouTube video was posted in July 2014 showing someone in a Browns jersey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDisrespects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDisrespects">emptying a catheter of urine onto Art Modell's grave</a>).
</li><li> The new Browns were reborn in 1999 to great enthusiasm (<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/b2ozXMzEVEw?t=135">see here how<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewCarey">Drew Carey</a> led the charge in their season opener) but typical expansion team woes, with a 43-0 drubbing in their opener against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">the Steelers</a> and a 5-27 record in their first two years. Things started to look up in Year 3 with new coach Butch Davis, finishing 7-9 in 2001 and reach 9-7 the following year and with it a Wild Card playoff spot...before losing 36-33 to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">the Steelers</a> while trying to get into field goal range to tie the game. The next four years were all losing seasons before the Browns managed to cobble together a 10-6 record in 2007...only to miss out on the playoffs due to losing a tiebreaker to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">the Steelers</a>. And the years since then have been mainly filled with instability at quarterback (the team started 30 different quarterbacks between 1999 and 2018) and despondent, miserable losing season after losing season, bottoming out in 2017 when they became only the second team ever to lose all 16 games in an NFL season. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/tRBDMMVctu8">The nonstop losing has become part of the Browns fandom's identity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And insult to injury, the former-Browns-now-Baltimore Ravens are still in their division and have won two Super Bowls.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cleveland Cavaliers are a team born from within the early throes of Cleveland's citywide championship curse in 1970. It was an inauspicious start, needing sixteen games to record the franchise's first victory. They gradually got better and by the mid-to-late 1970's the team made the playoffs, reaching as far as the Eastern Conference Finals thanks to the "Miracle at Richfield" in Game 7 of their series against the Washington Bullets before falling to the Boston Celtics in six games. Then...things took a turn:
<ul><li> First came the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Ted Stepien era of the Cavaliers in the early 1980's</a>, who soon proved himself to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement">an incredibly incompetent owner</a> who kept trading away first-round draft picks for players that didn't pan out, to the point where the NBA specifically passed the Ted Stepien Rule that disallows any team from trading their first-round pick for three consecutive years and eventually required any trade involving the Cavaliers to get league approval because other teams kept fleecing the Cavs in trade after trade. The Cavs under Stepien also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">had five head coaches in two seasons</a> as well as a new fight song based off of polka music and a dance team named the "Teddy Bears". The Cavs' on-court performance and attendance plummeted during his ownership, including a then-record 24-game losing streak and home games barely breaking 10% of the arena's capacity (with those going mainly voicing how much they hated Stepien and loved play-by-play announcer Joe Tait who had also been fired by Stepien). The Cavs' situation was so bad that in order to entice the Gund brothers to buy the team and keep it in Cleveland in 1983, the NBA granted them additional first-round picks to make up for the ones Stepien had traded away.
</li><li> By the late 1980's, though, the Cavs' new management was able to put together a good team that began challenging for the league's top spots. They just had the terrible luck of running into Michael Jordan was starting to show off his otherworldly talent that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">soon make the Chicago Bulls the dynasty of the 1990's</a>. Jordan and the Bulls beat Cleveland in their best-of-five first-round series in 1988, and met them again the following year in the first round. The teams split the first four games, and so Game 5 on May 7 was needed in Cleveland. It came down to the wire with the lead changing back and forth over the final minute; the Cavs were up 100-99 with three seconds left when Jordan took the inbound pass and made a jump shot from the foul line over Craig Ehlo to hit the buzzer-beating basket now know as just "The Shot" and win the series for the Bulls 101-100. The Cavs never seemed to recover after that — they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers next year, missed the playoffs after that, and though they made the playoffs in 1992, 1993, and 1994 they were knocked out by the Bulls each time.
</li><li> The mid-1990's through the first part of the 2000's were mostly bad years for Cleveland bereft of anything resembling success or hope, but at least in the NBA the draft lottery meant they had chances to get the top draft pick each of those terrible years. Which they eventually did in 2003, getting them hometown (well, Akron, but close enough) phenom LeBron James straight out of high school. For seven years James dazzled crowds and scored against defenses seemingly at will, but it became clear that James alone couldn't carry Cleveland to the promised land of an NBA championship — though the Cavs made it to the second round in James' third year, the team would always get eliminated along the way, with only one trip to the Finals in 2007 (and subsequently getting swept by the San Antonio Spurs). James' contract was up at the end of the 2010 season following a second-round loss to the Boston Celtics, and it was James' first time ever being courted for his services since he never went through the college recruitment thing most other players did. The Cavs were among those who made their pitch to him to stay, but so were other teams with bigger wallets and championship pedigrees like the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, and New York Knicks. In the end, James went a step further than other free agents and had a half-hour TV special with ESPN called "The Decision", where he announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">he would take his talents to South Beach</a> and sign with the Heat, where he could join with other big-name free agents signed by the Heat in Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade. Cleveland immediately <em>rioted</em> that night, Cavs fans burning his jersey in bonfires and Cavs owner Dan Gilbert sending out an angry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">poorly-edited</a> email declaring that the Cavs would win a championship before the "so-called King" would. The Cavs immediately collapsed to worst in the league the next season and into irrelevancy, with the only time anyone really paid attention to them was when the Heat came into town and everyone went to either boo LeBron or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">watch people boo LeBron</a>; James meanwhile won two championships in Miami.
</li><li> By 2014, the Cavs tried their best to regroup by drafting Kyrie Irving and trading for All-Star Kevin Love while rumors circulated once again due to James' contract with the Heat expiring. Seemingly learning his lesson from the backlash to the whole "Decision" thing, James just published a letter to fans announcing his intention to sign again with Cleveland. The Cavs immediately went back to the top of the Eastern Conference...just as they ran into yet <strong>another</strong> new dynasty in the making in the Golden State Warriors. They met in the 2015 NBA Finals, where the Warriors beat the Cavs in six games. The next season, they met <em>again</em> in the Finals and the Cavs went down three games to one, a basically-insurmountable deficit in the NBA playoffs. The Cavs then won Games 5 and 6, leading to Game 7 at Oakland; the game was close throughout, with the teams tied at 89 and under two minutes left when James, by now starting to show his age and usually not known for his defense, hustled all the way down the court to block an Andre Iguodala layup attempt for "The Block". Irving then made a three to put the Cavs up 92-89, and James would sink a free throw to seal the 93-89 victory, "The End" of Cleveland championship drought, and the biggest celebration for the city since 1964.
</li><li> Post-script: the Warriors and Cavs would meet <em>again</em> for the NBA championship in 2017 and <em>again</em> in 2018 — the Warriors won both times. James' contract expired again after 2018 and he left for the Los Angeles Lakers, though this time everyone had had time to get used to the idea and there was far less acrimony all around. The championship in 2016 probably helped it go down easier.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>American Football</h2>
<ul><li> The Arizona Cardinals and the Curse of the Pottsville Maroons. The 1925 NFL Championship game saw the Pottsville Maroons (Pottsville is a small coal-mining town in rural Pennsylvania) defeat the Chicago Cardinals 21-7, but the Maroons were stripped of their NFL championship after later playing in a supposedly unauthorized exhibition game in Philadelphia (both sides have disputed evidence on whether the game was sanctioned by the NFL). The Cardinals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisqualificationInducedVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisqualificationInducedVictory">took credit for the title</a> starting in 1933 under then-new owner Charles Bidwell (the Cardinals' owner in 1925, Chris O'Brien, actually <em>refused</em> to claim the title at the time because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">he felt his team didn't deserve to take the title from a team that beat them fairly</a>), an act that angered many Pottsville citizens. Legend says that the angered citizens cast a curse on the Cardinals that will deny the franchise a title until the championship is given back to Pottsville and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">returned to the proper shade of red</a>. The Cardinals won the NFL championship again in 1947, but it remains the last one for the Cardinals' franchise as of 2020 - after the 1947 championship they effectively dropped off the face of the earth as far as success (a total of five postseason appearances and one playoff win<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1fe65');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1fe65" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1fe65');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">1998 against the Dallas Cowboys</span> in <em>sixty years</em>). Things finally started to look up in 2008 with a revived Kurt Warner at the QB helm and an improbable run to Super Bowl XLIII...before losing a tight one to the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23 on a last-minute touchdown. Their closest approach since was 2015 (a 49-15 steamrolling at the hands of the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Championship Game).
<ul><li> Given that the impetus began with the Cardinals' claiming of the 1925 championship after they were purchased by Charles Bidwell and the team remains in the hands of his son Bill, some versions of the story direct the curse at the owners rather than the franchise itself.
</li><li> The NFL revisited the matter in 1963 but the vote among the owners was 12-2 in favor of continuing to recognize the Cardinals as 1925 champions; the two who voted against were Chicago Bears owner George Halas and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney. The matter was brought up again in 2003, but the owners decided 30-2 against reopening the case; the two who voted in favor of reopening were the Pittsburgh Steelers (again) and the Philadelphia Eagles. That the Steelers were the only team to support the Maroons' case both times lends some credence to the Cardinals' Super Bowl XLIII loss being curse-induced.
</li><li> Once the Chicago Cubs broke their championship drought in 2016, the Cardinals took the title of longest active championship drought in the Big Four North American sports.
</li></ul></li><li> The Detroit Lions and the Curse of Bobby Layne. Layne was a quarterback who spent 8 seasons with the Lions in the 1950's, leading them to several NFL championships in that time. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1958, to which supposedly he responded by saying the Lions would not win for 50 years<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20csa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20csa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20csa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">there's no first-hand record of him saying this, though</span>. In the 50 years since:
<ul><li> Not only did the Lions not win or even appear in another NFL championship or Super Bowl (the only other team to go so long without one is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Cleveland Browns</a>), they had the worst winning percentage of all teams.
</li><li> They had a total of ten postseason appearances, of which they won <em>one</em> playoff game (1991 against the Dallas Cowboys).
</li><li> The losing was so bad that Barry Sanders, probably the best Lion in recent memory, who played for the team in the 90's and during which the Lions had five of the said ten playoff appearances, retired while in peak physical form because he couldn't stand the losing culture and front office mismanagement.
</li><li> Insult to injury: the Steelers won Super Bowl XL in 2006, which was held at the Lions' home stadium of Ford Field that year.
</li><li> To cap it all off, in 2008 (the 50th year of the curse) the Lions became the first team in NFL history to lose every game in a 16-game season. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the only other team to have gone winless in a season (0-14 in 1976), and the Bucs had the excuse of being an expansion team in their first year of play. The Lions were later joined by the 2017 Cleveland Browns.

<ul><li> The Socceroos (Australia's national soccer team) and their witch doctor curse. For the 1970 World Cup AFC/OFC qualification, Australia travelled to Mozambique to play a two-game aggregate against Rhodesia. According to team captain Johnny Warren's 2002 autobiography, for the deciding game some team members consulted a local witch doctor, who proceeded to bury bones near the goal posts and place a curse on Rhodesia. Australia won 3-1 to proceed to the final round against Israel, but they couldn't come up with the fee the witch doctor requested, so the witch doctor hexed them as well. What followed:
<ul><li> Australia lost the home-and-home against Israel and the lone AFC/OFC spot to the World Cup.
</li><li> Australia did qualify for the 1974 World Cup, but didn't score a goal in three games and finished last in Group 1.
</li><li> Australia then failed to qualify for the next seven World Cups despite close calls in several of those qualifying campaigns (especially 1994, 1998, and 2002). The 1998 campaign especially stands out - Australia got to the OFC/AFC playoff against Iran for the final World Cup spot to be decided on a home-and-home playoff. The first game in Tehran ended 1-1, and in the second half of the second game in Melbourne Australia held a 2-0 lead until Iran scored goals in the 71st and 75th minute to earn the draw and qualify for the final World Cup spot on away goals.
</li><li> How it ended: two years after Warren's autobiography was published, John Safran read about it and travelled to Mozambique and hired a new witch doctor to lift the curse. The next year Australia qualified for the 2006 World Cup after defeating Uruguay in a shootout and with their move to AFC, Australia has become a major powerhouse in the Asian football/soccer scene and have qualified for every World Cup since then.

<ul><li> The Curse of Norm Smith: Norm Smith won six premierships as coach of the Melbourne Demons. In 1965, despite having won the premiership the previous year, he was controversially sacked, and subsequently claimed the club would never win another premiership. They didn't make the finals again until 1987, and as of 2017 are still yet to win the premiership again, with their closest attempts being grand final appearances in 1988 and 2000.

<ul><li> The "Andretti Curse" is the affliction of bad luck to the Andretti dynasty in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indianapolis 500</a> since Mario Andretti won the race in 1969. Despite there being five Andrettis (Mario, Michael, Jeff, John and Marco) to have raced at Indy since then, as of 2014 none have won another 500 as a driver (Michael Andretti won in 2005, 2007, and 2014 as a car owner). Some of the most notable examples of "Andretti luck" include Mario Andretti's finishing second after Bobby Unser was disqualified and then-reinstated as winner in 1981, finishing second behind Danny Sullivan (who spun his car but saved it earlier in the race), his engine blowing in 1987 after leading most of the race. Michael Andretti led most of the 1992 race but his engine failed ten laps from the finish. Marco Andretti was passed by Sam Hornish on the run to the finish line in 2006.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Baseball</h2>
<ul><li> The Boston Red Sox and the Curse of the Bambino. The Red Sox sold former player and baseball legend Babe Ruth to the now-hated rival New York Yankees in 1920. Prior to this, the Red Sox had a great deal of success, winning the World Series in 1915, 1916, and 1918; the Yankees, meanwhile, had been terrible since their inception. From 1923 through 2000, the Yankees won twenty-six World Series championships (at least one in every decade except the 1980's) and the Red Sox won zero. The curse finally ended in 2004, when the Red Sox won the World Series in a four-game sweep against the St. Louis Cardinals after coming back from a 3-0 series deficit in the ALCS against the Yankees, the only time such a comeback has ever happened in baseball. They've won another 3 World Series since then. Highlights in between:
<ul><li> The 1978 season. On July 18th, the Red Sox had a seemingly-insurmountable 14 game lead in the AL East before the Yankees got hot and managed to tie Boston in the standings on September 10th after a four-game sweep at Fenway Park by a combined score of 42-9, which fans took to calling the "Boston Massacre". The two teams ended the season tied atop the AL East, so a one-game playoff at Fenway was needed to decide who would play for the AL Pennant against Kansas City. Boston had a 2-0 lead in the top of the 7th before light-hitting Bucky Dent (who managed a total of 40 home runs in an 11-year career) got a 3-run homer over the Green Monster. The Yankees won 5-4 and went on to win the World Series, while Dent won the nickname Bucky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Fucking</a> Dent from Red Sox fans.
</li><li> The curse gained media prominence in the 1986 World Series, where the Red Sox had a 3-2 series lead against the New York Mets going into Game 6 and getting a 5-3 lead with 2 outs in the bottom of the 10th inning before losing that game (capped off by an error by first baseman Bill Buckner that let the winning run in) and Game 7. This led to George Vecsey's articles that posited the existence of the curse in national media.
</li><li> It got played again in 2003, when the Red Sox and Yankees met in the ALCS - Game 7 was at Yankee Stadium, where the Red Sox held a 5-2 lead with one out in the 8th inning before the Yankees tied it and eventually forced extra innings, where a pinch-hitting journeyman Aaron Boone hit a walkoff homer in the 11th. Comparisons to Dent's homer in 1978 were widespread, including being known as Aaron Fucking Boone by Red Sox Nation. The Red Sox would get their revenge the next year.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chicago Cubs and the Curse of the Billy Goat. As the story goes, during Game 4 of the 1945 World Series a bar owner named Billy Sianis brought his pet goat named Murphy to the game at Wrigley Field (even purchasing a separate ticket), but was kicked out because the goat's odor was bothering others. Sianis was infuriated and declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ncdr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ncdr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ncdr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His family claims he later sent a telegram to the Cubs' owner saying, "You are going to lose this World Series and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat."</span> The Cubs lost that game, lost the series, and did not play a World Series game again until 2016, the longest pennant drought in baseball. (The Cubs also hold the record for longest World Series drought - until their 2016 World Series victory, they hadn't won a championship since <em>1908</em>.) Highlights since:
<ul><li> The 1969 season. This was the first year each league was split into two divisions, and the Cubs had an 8 1/2-game lead in the NL East in mid-August and still held a 5-game on September 2nd over the second-place New York Mets. The Cubs then collapsed while the Mets went on a tear, ending with the Mets finishing first in the division with an 8-game lead over the Cubs. As if to drive home the point, a black cat had walked by Cubs captain Ron Santo while he was in the on-deck circle at Shea Stadium on September 9th - the next day the Mets took over first place in the division.
</li><li> The 1984 NLCS. The Cubs finished first in the NL East for the first time by 6 1/2 games. All that stood in their way was the NL West champ San Diego Padres in a best-of-5 series. The Cubs won the first two games at Wrigley, and fans could smell a return to the World Series. Then the Padres won Games 3 and 4 in San Diego. Then the deciding Game 5 - the Cubs had a 3-0 lead after two innings and still led 3-2 going into the bottom of the 7th. With a runner on second and one out, Tim Flannery of the Padres hit a grounder that went through the legs of Cubs first baseman Leon Durham, allowing San Diego to tie the game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4oi9w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4oi9w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4oi9w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If this seems similar to the Buckner error mentioned for the Red Sox, note that Bill Buckner started the 1984 season with the Cubs - he was traded to the Red Sox in May.</span> Then the next batter Tony Gwynn doubles in two more runs to give the Padres a lead which they would not relinquish.
</li><li> Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note562p9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note562p9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note562p9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">95 years to the day of the Cubs' last World Series victory; also, it was the Year of the Goat in the Chinese Zodiac</span>. The Cubs had a 3-2 series lead on the Florida Marlins and were up 3-0 with 1 out in the top of the 8th inning at Wrigley. Then a high foul ball towards the left field was hit, and a Cubs fan named Steve Bartman (among others) reached for it, knocking the ball into the stands, ruining any chance of making it the second out. The Cubs pleaded for fan interference but didn't get it. The Marlins then scored eight unanswered runs before the inning was over, winning that game as well as Game 7.
</li><li> In 2015, the Cubs had one of the strongest teams in the major leagues and won a playoff series for the first time since 2003. They made it to the NLCS...where they got swept by the Mets. The series MVP was Mets infielder Daniel Murphy, prompting jokes about how he wasn't the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">G.O.A.T.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6reoz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6reoz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6reoz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><strong>G</strong>reatest <strong>O</strong>f <strong>A</strong>ll <strong>T</strong>ime</span> to keep the Cubs out of the World Series; a Twitter post also made the rounds on the internet pointing out that "Murphy" had been present in several of the seasons connected to the still-ongoing curse (namely, that the Cubs' owner in 1908 was Charles Murphy, the 1969 Mets had a GM named Johnny Murphy and a radio announcer named Bob Murphy, and the Padres' home field in 1984 was named Jack Murphy Stadium). Additionally, the day they lost, October 21, 2015, was also the date traveled to in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">which also said that was the day they'd win the World Series</a>, which led many to dub this the "Back To The Future" Curse.
</li><li> In 2016, the Cubs would not only <em>finally</em> win the Pennant by beating the Dodgers in 6 games, but at long last win a World Series in a nail-biter against the Cleveland Indians. The latter was an especially tense victory, considering the Cubs were at one point down three games to one before they rallied back to win Games 5 and 6, and then in Game 7 took a 6-3 lead into the bottom of the 8th before the Indians tied it on a Rajai Davis home run, <em>and then</em> the game finished the regulation nine innings tied at 6 when a rain delay set in, making it seem like their curse wasn't quite done with them (or the Indians, who at that time had the second-longest World Series championship drought and had been dogged with curse talk of their own) yet.
</li></ul></li><li> In Japan, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Colonel">The Curse of the Colonel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has afflicted the Hanshin Tigers ever since fans threw a statue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken">Colonel Sanders</a> into the Dotonbori River after the 1985 Japanese Championship Series. It was believed that the Tigers would never win another championship until the statue was recovered, but they've kept losing since it was found in 2009. Some attribute this to the fact that the glasses and left hand are still missing.

<ul><li> The New York Rangers and the Curse of 1940. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1940, which was also the year the mortgage was paid off on Madison Square Garden, their home arena<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note73g3w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note73g3w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note73g3w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that it's <em>not</em> the current building known as Madison Square Garden that sits atop Penn Station - that one was opened in 1968</span>. Management celebrated by burning the mortgage document in the Cup itself - this was said to invoke the curse, and the Rangers did not win the Cup again for 54 years (a Stanley Cup drought record that still stands). "1940" would haunt Rangers fans all those years, <em>especially</em> once fans of the New York Islanders (who won the Cup four straight seasons between 1980 and 1983) and later the New Jersey Devils (whose old home Brendan Byrne<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8kzv1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8kzv1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8kzv1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">later Continental Airlines Arena, now the Izod Center</a></span> seats 19,040) weaponized it as a taunt of "19-40!".

<ul><li> Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals gets special mention because it seemed like the Curse would not die - the Rangers had a 1-0 lead in the closing seconds before Valeri Zelepukin of the Devils scored the tying goal with 7.7 seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Then Stephane Matteau scored in double overtime to send the Rangers to the Stanley Cup Finals.
</li><li> It could just be that the early 90's in general was when the Curse was vicious - the '91-'92 season saw the Rangers play well, winning the Presidents Trophy (best regular season record) before losing to eventual champ Pittsburgh in the Patrick Division Finals (during which goalie Mike Richter let in a goal from a shot from the blue line). The next season things started out looking good, but then defenseman Brian Leetch suffered a neck injury during a game in December and later broke his ankle; the Rangers finished last in the division that year. And how did Leetch break his ankle? He took a taxi from the Garden after a game against the San Jose Sharks, stepped out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">slipped on an ice patch in the street</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> No Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup since the Montreal Canadiens in 1993, by far the longest such stretch in the Cup's history. This despite several close calls from various Canadian teams during that stretch: the Vancouver Canucks in 1994 and 2011, both times losing in Game 7 (and both times seeing riots in Vancouver after those losses); the Calgary Flames in 2004 (who lost in Game 7); the Edmonton Oilers in 2006 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">who lost in Game 7</a>); and the Ottawa Senators in 2007 (who lost in five games). The blame for the curse seems to fall on the Canadiens, though the exact cause varies by source — some say it is retribution for Canadiens fans rioting in Montreal after their team won the Cup in 1993, causing millions of dollars in damages; others say it is for nabbing Los Angeles Kings defenseman Marty McSorley for using a stick that was too curvy in Game 2<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ydz6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10ydz6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ydz6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">McSorley was given a two-minute unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and Montreal scored the tying goal on the power play before winning in overtime</span> because the team asked Montreal Forum employees about whose sticks were illegal.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11vywj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11vywj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11vywj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Canadiens coach Jacques Demers denied they asked Forum employees and credits Canadiens captain Guy Carbonneau with spotting it on the ice.</span>

</li><li> <em>The Curse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> revolves around Guybrush trying to save Elaine from a cursed ring that transformed her into a gold statue.
</li><li> Not surprisingly, this shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> a few times.
<ul><li> The recurring spell "Curse" appears in multiple games. Effects across the games include reduced stats, preventing limit break use, stopping job changes in battle, inflicting a variety of other status ailments, stopping the DMW wheel, or reducing the amount of successful interrupts by a character while increasing the number of successful interrupts by an enemy.
</li><li> Another recurring spell, "Doom", starts a timer that kills the afflicted character when the timer runs out. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, the Curse spell actually inflicts Doom, though the Curse status ailment is a separate entity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>, the prince of the elves was cursed by the dark elf Astos with eternal sleep. Only an herb from the witch Matoya can wake him. Unfortunately, she's blind and needs a special eye to see...and Astos stole it from her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, Djinn curses the kingdom of Sasune and turns everyone in the kingdom of Sasune to ghosts. Two future party members, Ingus and Refia, missed getting cursed because neither was around when the curse hit. The only way to lift the curse is with Princess Sara's Mythril Ring, which needs to seal the Djinn inside and then be purified.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, the character Reis was cursed into the form of a dragon when she took on a curse intended for her lover, Beowulf. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody">The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body</a>, she also appears to have no memory of her life as a human either, though the dragon Reis still joins the party when Beowulf rescues her. He eventually changes her back when the party recovers the Cancer Zodiac Stone and she joins the party as a "Dragonkin" (Dragoner in the PS1 version) with all her dragon skills.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, Cid's wife Hilda turns him into an Oglop as punishment for cheating on her and runs off in the only non-Mist powered airship in the world. This turns out to be supremely bad timing since Kuja has just manipulated Alexandria into attacking Lindblum. He later tries to undo it but ends up turning into a frog instead. Eventually they have to track his wife down and convince her to undo her curse. Wouldn't you know it, Kuja also kidnapped <em>her</em> since he needed her ship. When she's finally rescued, she changes Cid back, but threatens to curse him again if he ever acts unfaithfully again.
</li><li> The Tonberries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> are actually Lalafells that were cursed by a monster as it inflicted a contagious plague on them upon dying. The curse made the Tonberries become filled with rancor and anger, effectively becoming hostile. The source of the rancor comes from the Tonberry King in the Wanderer's Palace. Slaying him restores the Tonberries emotions back to normal, but they are still stuck in their Tonberry form. In the hard mode version of the same dungeon, the Tonberries are captured by the Mamool Ja as slaves and you're tasked with saving them. The Scholar job quest lines also has a friendly Tonberry who aids you.

<div class="indent"> <strong>The Father:</strong> <em>Thrice now I curse, and from the first, your family shall feel the worse.

</div></li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> is that everyone in the kingdom of Trodain except the main character has been cursed by the villainous Dhoulmagus. King Trode is now a little troll-like creature, Princess Medea is a horse, and everyone else is a statue. The main character escaped the curse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because a memory wiping curse that was cast on him when he was younger had the beneficial side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneCurseLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneCurseLimit">rendering him immune to other curses</a>.</span>

She throws a dark magic-infused scarf at him, which he dodges at first, but ultimately wraps around him and saddles him with a curse so powerful that ordinary priests can't remove it. The curse sticks with Samson until the party ascends to Heaven and personally asks Arawn (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> of this setting) to have it lifted.
</li><li> Warlocks from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> have a variety of curses they can inflict on a mob or character including the Curses of Agony, Doom, Elements, Exhaustion, Recklessness, Tongues, and Weakness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em> has a map dedicated to this trope: Cursed Hallow.

Which leads to quite a few instances of <em>stupid</em> candy hunters paying a price for being selfish:
<ul><li> The first appearance of Abby's rival, Heinrich von Marzipan, involved Heinrich swiping her "blurpleberry supreme" in order to loot the tomb of King Tutakhandy. After reading the part of the inscription that said, "With the crown you shall control the sarcophagus", he disregarded the rest, refusing to listen to Numbuh Five when she tried to warn him that the other half was, "but refuse to share and only taste asparagus". Naturally, he found out that part the hard way, but the curse only lasted so long as he had the crown, which Abby took from him.
</li><li> He didn't get off quite as easy the next time. After trying to turn a pet rabbit into a chocolate one via a chocolate volcano, he fell into the choco-lava himself and was left for dead. However, he was actually turned into living chocolate, who could turn anything else into chocolate via touch. It was practically heaven for him, until he started craving foods other than chocolate, which he now couldn't have. The KND was able to cure him, but he didn't learn...
</li><li> Operation LICORICE had <em>two</em> curses in one episode:
<ul><li> First, the candy pirate Black John Licorice discovered an island of red licorice trees, and selfishly chopped it all down and carted it away. The horrible curse he and his crew was punished with turned the licorice itself black (which is, to folks like him, inedible) and turned them into undead skeletons <em>made</em> of licorice, who could only function at night. Eventually, they sought a gypsy fortuneteller who gave them a magic seed that could restore the island, but they were unable to plant it before dawn. which led to the second curse...
</li><li> The island was eventually found by Stickbeard and Heinrich (again) and Heinrich foolishly took the seed, causing Black John's crew to pursue him endlessly. Leading to the actual plot of the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The biggest curse involving Heinrich came with Operation: CARAMEL, which explained the "Guatemala Incident" he had often referred to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As it turned out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Heinrich had once been a girl named Henrietta</a>, meaning "Heinrich" was a curse she had been afflicted with since the aforementioned incident. In order to create pieces of ancient golden caramel, a magic ritual was performed that took away the most valued quality of a person present and turned that quality into five pieces of delicious caramel with flavor depending on the quality taken. Henrietta fell victim to the ritual's side effect, which transformed her into Heinrich, but before the curse could be reversed, she selfishly ate all of her caramels, causing her to lose the quality she valued the most. Knowing that Henrietta could not control her greed, Abigail left her behind, and Henrietta blamed her for becoming cursed. (Although as it turned out, Abigail had been keeping Henrietta's last piece, which enables the curse to finally be broken, and the two reconcile.)</span>

<ul><li> King Tut's tomb was opened in 1922. It's been long stated that a curse on the tomb killed everyone involved, though such stories detailing the events are rather exaggerated and often flat out untrue. Nearly a hundred years later, whether you believe that it was involved with a curse or not, we can confirm that everyone involved in the event did die eventually.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> wrote a "do not disturb" curse which is inscribed over his grave at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon (adjusted to modern spelling):
<div class="indent"> Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear <br/>To dig the dust enclosed here <br/>Blest be the man that spares these stones <br/>and curst be he that moves my bones.
</div><ul><li> The curse was obviously effective, as Shakespeare's remains stayed in the tomb to this day (as opposed to the usual procedure, in which a body would be removed in a couple of decades to free up the space for the next corpse).
</li></ul></li><li> Most societies, particularly animist ones, believe in curses of various sorts. For instance, throughout the Middle East, you'll find women wearing or carrying blue eyeball charms to protect against the evil eye.
</li><li> One of the most widely-believed traditional curses in folklore, that of impotency, can be quite effective provided its intended victim is at least slightly inclined to believe in curses, and knows it has been applied to him. This isn't supernatural: rather, a man's feelings of anxiety <em>about</em> the alleged "curse" can work to suppress the physiological effects of arousal, in a feedback loop that gets stronger every time the victim attempts to become aroused and fails, thus "proving" the curse's efficacy. Rituals performed to "break the curse" will often seem just as effective in such cases, as it alleviates the anxiety which is really to blame for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight">The Loins Sleep Tonight</a>.

</li><li> Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, just as he looked on track to win the Democratic nomination.
</li><li> These were not the first tragedies to befall the Kennedy family however. Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr and Kathleen Kennedy both died in plane-related incidents 20 years earlier.
</li><li> 2 new-born Kennedy babies (Patrick and Arabella) died as well.
</li><li> Rosemary Kennedy, the eldest daughter of Joseph Sr, was lobotomised in 1941 to fix her mental instability, but the process only made things even worse, and she was institutionalised for the rest of her life.
</li><li> Poor Ted Kennedy. In 1964, he was in a brutal plane crash where he suffered from from a broken back, a punctured lung, broken ribs, and internal bleeding. He lived.
<ul><li> In 1969, he accidentally drove his car off a bridge. The incident was controversial because he escaped while his passenger (his secretary Mary Jo Kopechne) drowned, and he was given a suspended sentence for failing to report the accident in time. Had his reputation not been tarnished by the incident, he might well have become President.
</li><li> He finally passed away in 2009 of brain cancer.
</li></ul></li><li> David Kennedy, one of Robert F. Kennedy's sons, fatally overdosed in 1984.
</li><li> David's younger brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy was fatally injured in a skiing accident in 1997.
</li><li> John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash along with his wife Carolyn and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette in 1999.
</li><li> More recently, Mary Richardson Kennedy committed suicide in 2011.
</li><li> Yet again another member passed away in 2019: Robert F.Kennedy's granddaughter Saoirse died of suspected overdose at age 22.

</li><li> 2000: Some would say 9/11 was an assassination attempt on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a>, as the Capitol was an alleged target of United 93. However, like Reagan, Bush finished two terms alive and well. It's been speculated that Reagan's survival ended up breaking the curse.
<ul><li> On May 10 2005, Bush survived an assassination attempt when Vladimir Arutyunian threw a live grenade at his during a speech in Georgia, but it failed to detonate.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>only</em> exception to the above list was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZacharyTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZacharyTaylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, who was elected in 1848 &amp; died in 1850, but those who believe in the curse would argue it applies to him as well, since Taylor was a veteran of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">the very war</a> where the U.S. fought Tecumseh.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most famous curses is that supposedly uttered by Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a>, when he was burned at stake in Paris in 1314. The two men responsible for his death, King Philip IV (called "the Fair") of France and Pope Clement V, died within a year. Philip's royal house, the Capetians, became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">extinct in the male line</a> with his three sons (Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV), leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>. Philip IV and his sons are thus popularly known as <em>les rois maudits</em> (the cursed kings) in France. Some like to believe that Jacques de Molay's curse continued to wreak havoc on the kings of France, as the following two dynasties also ended with three brothers ruling in succession, the Valois with Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III and the Bourbons with Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X. Conspiracy theorists on the other hand like to believe that the Knights Templar plotted revenge against the kings of France, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">morphed into the Freemasons and masterminded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>.
</li><li> The Sports Curse of the city of Cleveland Ohio was allegedly the inability for the city to win <em>any</em> championship title in <em>any</em> major league sports. The city's second-most recent championship was the Browns NFC Championship game of 1966, two years before the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a></em>. The Browns appeared in the NFC Championship game in 1987, one game away from the Super Bowl, but still lost to the Denver Broncos. Returning the next year along with the Broncos, the Browns made a fumble late in the game that cost them the win. It didn't help when the team was moved to Baltimore in 1995 and an expansion Browns team that started in 1999 lacked the same kind of skill or energy. The Indians also a long way with no championship, the last World Series they won was in 1948. They made it to the World Series in 1997 only to blow it in game 7. They would return again in 2016 to fall to the Chicago Cubs also after seven games. The element that broke the curse, the Cavaliers, didn't always have a smooth road either. They made their first finals appearance in 2007 where they'd lose to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010 front-man LeBron James announced his departure from the Cavs to move to the Miami Heat, where he led them to three NBA Finals appearances and two victories. He would return to Cleveland in 2014 and lead the Cavs to two consecutive Finals appearances. The curse was finally broken in 2016 when the Cavs defeated the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.
</li><li> Theres said to be a curse around the lost treasure of Montezuma, supposedly buried in the mythical Aztec homeland near modern <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanab,_Utah">Kanab, Utah<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Aztec warriors to hide it from the Spaniards. Quite a few treasure hunters have gone looking for it over the years, but their efforts were stymied by a series of accidents and disasters, from rattlesnakes to constant equipment failure to panic attacks in seasoned, professional divers plumbing a lake thought to be over the burial site. A good few locals are convinced that there is treasure there, and that the curse will get anyone who tries to take it.
</li><li> The curse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame">Timur the Lame</a> is an relatively obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> legend. Its said that Soviet scientists discovered his tomb, exhumed his body and found a inscription that says "whoever opens it shall unleash a worse invader than I". Two days afterwards, Adolf Hitler began Operation Barbarossa which resulted in thousands of Soviet deaths being the proverbial "invader" worse than Timur. Furthermore, the legend claims that the tide only began to turn after the tomb was restored and Timur's body was buried with proper Islamic rituals, having taken place when the Battle of Stalingrad was on. As such many superstitious Muslims from Central Asia believe that Timur's curse changed the course of history.
