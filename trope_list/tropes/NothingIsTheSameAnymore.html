Then we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the deputy chief of the Inspection Department is actually <em>heir to the throne</em></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>'s third volume ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the destruction of Neo-Tokyo, shifting the story from a cyberpunk to a post-apocalyptic setting</span>.

</li><li> The Eclipse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is as Earth-shattering an example of this as can be imagined.

<ul><li> The series developed gradually for a while. The Black Knights would win small battles and recruit allies and basically consolidate their power overtime, sure, but they never made grabs to free Japan rapidly, and no major characters died nor were any important Knightmares permanently destroyed.

</li><li> The final four episodes of R2 take it to a whole new level. Lelouch spent the majority of the series working towards Britannia's destruction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch is now the Britannian emperor</span>. Suzaku spent the majority of the series trying to capture or kill Lelouch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzaku is now Lelouch's bodyguard</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> originally started out as a lighthearted shounen heavy on the comedy with some minor drama. But from the Tower of Heaven arc onwards, things start to get a whole lot more serious. Including but not limited to Erza's dark backstory, one of two good character death in the whole story, and Natsu actually losing fights! The drama then tends to overshadow the comedy for the most part from then on. And it only gets darker from there.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series started out as mostly light-hearted, wacky adventures that Goku and his friends gotten into. Sure they were some threats but you knew they'd come out on top eventually. But it changes at the end of the 22nd Martial Arts Tournament and the beginning of King Piccolo Saga with Krillin being killed by one of Piccolo's henchmen. Things took a darker turn from then on with much more at stake and this would continue on into <em>Z</em>.
</li><li> A comparable minor one, but the cast is stunned when they see little Goku had grown into a handsome young man and Krillin has also gotten noticeably bigger. The dub episode is even called "Changes". This marks the point where Goku's childhood adventures are officially over.
</li><li> The start of <em>Z</em> starts with Goku visiting his friends after five years. In that afternoon, we learned Goku has a son and he's an alien from a warrior race, the Saiyans. In the same saga, we learned Piccolo is also an alien and that there is another set of Dragon Balls in the universe.
</li><li> Goku becoming a Super Saiyan in his fight against Frieza. A transformation of this level had never been seen before in the series or even Shōnen at the time.
</li><li> Goku spent the vast majority of the Android and Cell saga out of the action due to a Heart Virus, and when he finally does get to fight is <strong>killed</strong> by Cell. This creates a world where the Z-Fighters can no longer rely on Goku to save the world and all have to step up.
</li><li> The seven years between the end of the Cell Games and the start of the Majin Buu Saga. Gohan is now a teen, there is now a second son of Goku, and Krillin is married with a child and has hair.
</li><li> The DBZ movie <em>Battle of Gods</em> did this by introducing real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> such as Beerus, a new branch of Super Saiyan that is separate from the normal transformations, and the information that the Dragon World we have come to know is Universe 7 out of 12.
</li><li> Dragon Ball Super tops this by introducing Jiren, the mortal stronger than <em>his</em> God of Destruction, and the introduction of Ultra Instinct.

And lastly, Keima cries alone as he apologies to Chihiro for leading her on and then breaking her heart so fiercely</span>.

From that point on, nothing for the entire season, yet alone <em>series</em> afterward is the same.
<ul><li> Usagi was traumatized for the first few episodes of the R season, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">what happened to everyone (including herself) at the end of the previous season</a>, to the point where her powers started to fail due to the stress of wanting to be a normal girl, fearing that the others might die again (notably Makoto in the episode where she's weak after giving blood), and depressed over the fact that Mamoru doesn't remember her and that the Moonlight Knight seemingly isn't him. It isn't until she finally accepts that she's always going to be Sailor Moon that she gets her resolve and power back, and she's noticeably less silly and more dedicated from that point onward for the rest of the series.

Enemies are dealt with completely, whether it's via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">redemption</a> or death. With clearly-defined, low-level exceptions, dead is dead — a villain blasted to atoms isn't coming back, and this is consistent enough that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">Issei's death</a> comes as a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>, and his resurrection is as miraculous to the reader as it is in-universe</span>.

When the arc ends, Nagi, Maria and Hayate have to move out of the mansion the entire manga's been spent in and start making their own way (though they bounce back surprisingly quickly.)
<ul><li> Athena's appearance in general marks a major turning point in the series. Athena herself is the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">serious antagonist</a> in the series, and is not only the reason for Hayate's superhuman physical prowess and fighting skill, but proof that his tragic backstory extends even further beyond his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker">Ed Brubaker</a> love changing their characters' status quo. To stick only with Daredevil: During Bendis' run <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daredevil was unmasked by press, The Kingpin was killed but got better, Matt got married, became the new Kingpin, was left by his wife and was thrown in jail</span>.

And please, don't ask how it goes in their other titles.
</li><li> Most recently, writer Mark Waid made Matt Murdock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">publicly admit he was Daredevil, later embrace his alter ego, and subsequently ditch his double identity, fighting crime without a mask, using the same suit as Matt Murdock and Daredevil, and addressing himself as Daredevil</span>.
</li><li> When you're writing for a comic about "The Man Without Fear" writers kinda feel obligated to provide situations where the hero is afraid.
</li></ul></li><li> The comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em> is sort of like this, though it only goes twelve issues with the initial status quo before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character's father does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and beats the living crap out of his son</span>, starting the status quo for the rest of the series. Issue 50 looks to shake things up again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewUniverse">The New Universe</a></em> comic <em>Justice</em> did an impressive one of these about halfway through its run. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In Issue 15 (cleverly titled Everything You Know Is Wrong) the readers — and the main character — find out that he isn't an Interdimensional holy warrior but in fact a DEA agent who had an entire false life mentally implanted into him by a drug lord. He then becomes a borderline psychotic loner, who still can suffer flashbacks to his fake life if drugged up enough</span>.
</li><li> Erik Larsen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSavageDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSavageDragon">The Savage Dragon</a></em> tends to change its status quo quite often.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> has had this trope happen twice (or more depending on definitions) in ways that are likely to stay permanently (a rarity for comics), and a bunch of others that might change.
<ul><li> The original Robin, Dick Grayson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick">became</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>.
<ul><li> Robin #2 was killed then returned, if only long enough for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> to The Red Hood.
</li><li> Robin #3, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Tim Drake</a>, changed his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Red Robin</a>.
</li><li> Batman had a son (without his knowledge or consent, apparently) with Talia al-Ghul. He's a 10-year-old trained assassin and Robin #5. He is killed by his clone/brother trying to save Gotham.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope is commonly invoked in the marketing of any given big comic book event. Whether it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> or a big storyline within a single book, editorial loves to entice readers to pick it up with the promise that nothing will ever be the same afterward. Sometimes this is true... but just as often, whatever changes the storyline brings are eventually undone either by plot contrivance or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a>.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> in the early 2000's. At the time, the book was famous for pulling big storylines about once a year. The ad copy for the following issue promised that "nothing will ever be the same again! Yeah, we know we say that all the time... but it's been true every time we've said it."
</li><li> As both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossovers</a> and <em>The Flash</em> were mentioned, combing them leads to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Marvel is currently doing it all the time — almost everything changes so fast that it's scary.
<ul><li> An early example is in the 1960s is when the writers decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> of his external pacemaker function continually threatening to run out of power on him and give heart failure was getting old. So, they wrote a story where Stark is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauledBeforeASenateSubCommittee">Hauled Before a Senate Subcommittee</a>, where the arduous question goes so long that Stark collapses with his battery problems. A doctor examines him, discovers his seriously poor state of health and has him rushed to a hospital. After that, Stark finally gets some serious medical care by professionals which leads to a heart transplant to help him. (He still needed the chest plate for a while so his body wouldn't "reject" his new heart, and he's suffered a spate of other health-related problems over the years.)
</li><li> An even more dramatic change was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> series its early years when the US military had no idea about Banner's Hulk condition, but suspected the scientist and the monster were compatriots. In one pivotal episode, Rick Jones, convinced that Banner was dead, told Col. Glenn Talbot the truth and from then on, Banner was a fugitive from the US authorities determined to kill or contain him.
</li><li> Despite claims by the comic's marketing to the contrary, mostly averted with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars (1984)</a></em> mini-series. Given that it was competing with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> (having been released almost simultaneously), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars (1984)</a></em> was advertised as being a complete shakeup of the Marvel Universe, and that nothing in Marvel would ever be the same afterward. This was only true in a few instances:
<ul><li> Spider-Man acquired his black suit, which would go on to empower the supervillain Venom.
</li><li> She-Hulk joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, and stayed with them for some time. She's still considered a close friend of the family.
</li><li> The Hulk had Banner's brain, and had recently been pardoned of all past crimes. Something on Battleworld caused him to slip back into an angry persona, leading to a multi-state mindless rampage with thousands of fatalities. Fallout from that rampage was subtext or text for decades.
</li><li> Most other changes, like the destruction of Ultron and Kang, did not stick.
</li><li> In a couple of places they even restored status quo that had previously been shaken up, like Dr Doom who had been dead prior to Secret Wars but mysteriously showed up for the story leading to the need for a later storyline to explain how he'd come back.
</li></ul></li><li> The Marvel Now! imprint that started on the heels of <em>Fear Itself</em> and <em>Avengers vs X-Men</em> started to do this too. Most notably:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doc Ock switched bodies with Peter Parker, killed his own body with Peter Parker in it, but not before inheriting all of Peter's memories. He is currently fighting crime under Spider-Man's mantle, as a "Superior" Spider-Man.</span>
</li><li> The original Nick Fury has gone under the radar, being replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">his son, who resembles Ultimate Nick Fury.</a>
</li><li> Iron Man is a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
</li><li> The Avengers and the X-Men formed a united sub-team nicknamed the Uncanny Avengers.
</li><li> In <em>Avengers vs X-Men</em> Cyclops <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killed Professor X while under the influence of the Phoenix Force, and is attempting to redeem himself while everyone he knows hates and fears him.</span> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Phoenix Force is now destroyed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ppmp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ppmp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ppmp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given that based on previous storylines, the destruction of the Phoenix Force ought to result in the end of all life in the universe, it's anyone's guess how long this lasts before it's retconned.</span>, causing untold damage to the universe (some effects are briefly seen in Gillen's Iron Man run; the Celestials are now aware of aliens living off of their lifeblood, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">and are not amused</a>).</span>
</li><li> The "Age of Ultron" storyline, Ultron returned and is ruling over a dystopian world.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> changed everything again: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peter Parker regains control of his body, but is left holding the bag of everything Dr. Octopus had left over, including Parker Industries, a doctorate, a girlfriend in the form of Anna-Maria Marconi and a <em>lot</em> of ill will. Thankfully, the superhero community is more forgiving than, say, Mary Jane Watson</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHeroIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHeroIsDead">In Hell</a></span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> started out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>, but has moved to having this as a goal to set it apart from the main Marvel Universe. The first big change was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum">Ultimatum</a></em> event, but that's not the only one:
<ul><li> With the X-Men, everyone considered a mutant leader or potential leader (Professor X, Magneto, Cyclops, Wolverine) died in <em>Ultimatum</em>. Mutancy is now outlawed and people are allowed to shoot on sight, forcing mutants underground. And it's been revealed that the mutant gene was created in a lab, removing any protection they would have gotten as "the next step of evolution".
</li><li> The Fantastic Four also disbanded after <em>Ultimatum</em>, and it's unlikely they'll come back together anytime soon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Reed has undergone a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a></span>, with Johnny going off to join the <em>Spider-Man</em> cast and then the X-Men instead. Ben "The Thing" Grimm also shed his rocky skin, gaining energy powers instead.
</li><li> Spider-Man was killed in action, and a new character with no direct connection to Peter Parker has taken up the mantle.
</li><li> In the fall of 2012, it looks as though that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain America will become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent">President of the United States</a> (a divided and broken up U.S., mind you, but still...)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesLegendaires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LesLegendaires">Les Légendaires</a> went through this during the Anathos Cycle: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Danael</a> is possessed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a>, killed and resurrected but no longer part of the team, all the other protagonists have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever">scarred or crippled to life</a> and get new powers and abilities, they finally got rid of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a> status, their Arch-Enemy has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, the couples have fallen apart and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> has been added.
</li><li> DC comics is well known for their various cosmic retcons, and absorbing other comic universes into the mainstream, the most notable example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> did this for their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series following the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide</a></em> storyline thanks to Dr. Eggman's unwillingness to let Sonic win. The full extent of this is a soft reboot, the multiverse collapsing, and the planet shattering.
<ul><li> Issue 50, the final issue of the "Endgame" arc, saw Dr. Robotnik be eradicated when his Ultimate Annihilator weapon goes unstable. At the time, this was a <em>major</em> game-changer, with the following issues (including the next 48-page special, aptly named "<em>Brave New World</em>") finding the Freedom Fighters dealing with a world where they finally achieved their ultimate goal and how to bring peace to a land without Robotnik.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> does this at a rate of about every ten issues. The most memorable times include when Lucifer makes his own universe, when God leaves creation and locks it behind Him, when His granddaughter takes His throne; when the Angel of Silence <em>speaks</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover">Bat Family Crossover</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LightsOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LightsOut">Lights Out</a></em> was billed as "the story that will change the Green Lantern universe forever". And given that by the time it's over, we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the destruction of Oa, the Green Lanterns relocating to Mogo, the Blue Lanterns wiped out (save for Saint Walker) and the Red Lanterns given sole jurisdiction over Sector 2814 (including Earth)</span>, it's safe to say it lived up to the hype.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>: This is enforced by the 'mega epics', big crisis story arcs that change the status quo. For instance, during "The Apocalypse War" half of Mega City One and all of East Meg One is destroyed, and "Day of Chaos" ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mega City One reduced to a virtual ruin</span>. As the comic also avoids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> by taking place in real time, Judge Dredd has aged significantly since the comic's debut and is feeling it.
</li><li> A constant occurrence (some would say problem) with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>, who for all her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Importance</a> as one of DC's "Big Three" only had one book to her name after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">the 1940s</a>. Since they don't have any other books to coordinate with<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1sau4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1sau4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1sau4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The various <em>Justice League</em> books tend to have no say in how their members' solo books are run</span>, pretty much <em>every</em> new Wonder Woman writer feels free to toss out everything the last guy did in favor of a brand-new status quo:
<ul><li> The first instance of this was probably the infamous "white suit" period of the late '60s/early '70s in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Vol 1</a>. Under new writer <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisONeil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisONeil">Dennis O Neil</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor">Steve Trevor</a> was killed, all of Paradise Island (aka Themyscira) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and Wonder Woman was depowered into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s">Emma Peel</a>-like martial artist who no longer bothered with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy">iconic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgePerez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgePerez">George Pérez</a> run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Vol 2</a> ended on one of these, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> <em>War of the Gods</em>. Killed off several members of Diana's supporting cast, had the Gods of Olympus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, and stripped Themyscira - just beginning to come out of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a> phase - of all its mystic protections.
</li><li> The first chance he got, Perez's successor Bill Loebs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24y92');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24y92" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24y92');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">dropped a bridge on all of Themyscira</a>, apparently so he could take the character in a more urban, "small-picture" direction (though at least he let her keep her powers). After a few years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">editorial</a> made him bring Themyscira back, explaining it wasn't <em>really</em> destroyed but instead banished to a realm of demons.
</li><li> Loebs' successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a> kicked off his run by moving Diana to the West Coast and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> invade and kill a third of Themyscira; after that things mostly settled down... until the Olympians came back, Diana got killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Neron</a>, and the former promptly resurrected the latter as a new Goddess. In the meantime, Diana's mother Queen Hippolyta became the new Wonder Woman - who, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> shenanigans, was retconned into being the "original" Wonder Woman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Diana took the name back in the final issue of the run anyways</a>.
</li><li> Byrne's successor Eric Luke didn't do much in the way of big shake-ups, though the last issue of his run had Diana establish Themysciran embassies all around the world.
</li><li> After Luke came <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilJimenez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilJimenez">Phil Jimenez</a>, a master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a> like no other (if you read any of DC's official Wonder Woman reference books, chances are he wrote it). As such, he did his best to cram <em>all</em> his predecessors' work into a single narrative. Unfortunately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> <em>Our Worlds At War</em> happened early on in his run, and its plot-mandated Themyscira be destroyed <em>and</em> Hippolyta be killed off; while Jimenez couldn't undo the latter, he had surviving Amazons rebuild the former into a bigger, better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> paradise than ever before, open to ambassadors and academics from every nation.

While the introduction of ponies to avatar world is jarring enough, The Great Change causes massive changes in both worlds far beyond what was in the original Korra season. Namely, the pony world gains bending, and all ponies now resemble real horses rather than their more cartoony proportions. They also gain the ability to change into humanoids in avatar world, as well as empowering different aspects of their worlds with each other, such as giving the breezies the power to move on their own, or bringing equestrian plants over the divide. More importantly on the more spiritual side of things, Korra leaves the spirit portal open, but she also gains permanent wings. Furthermore, rather than being absorbed, Raava and Vaatu are instead transmuted into smaller spirit forms (a butterfly and a bat/moth respectively), fully leaving Korra to do her own thing from now on.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em> comes off as a fairly simple action movie for most of its running time, with all of its plot threads tied up perfectly by the end. Then the one-two punch of the ending comes. First, the ultra-persistent Agent Coulson finally catches up with Tony and helpfully provides him with a pre-written statement to explain his odd behavior to the press; when Tony throws that statement away and says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">I am Iron Man"</a>, we know that Tony's secret identity is out the window for good, and he now has a high-level government agency involved in his life.

For savvy fans of the comics, that scene instantly made it clear that this "simple action movie" was going to be the start of one <em>hell</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>.
<ul><li> Tony admitting to the press that he is Iron Man was <em>itself</em> a game changer for the MCU: a decade later it was revealed by Kevin Feige to be an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/kevin-feige-robert-downey-jr-improvised-iron-man-twist-ending-1201986093/">ad lib<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Robert Downey Jr., replacing the original ending in which Stark follows the comic book storyline with "Iron Man" being passed off as his bodyguard.

<ul><li> In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">POV character Eddard Stark is beheaded about 90% of the way through this volume after the entirety of this book — up to this point — had been setting him up to be a hero and the primary protagonist</span>.
</li><li> In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Robb Stark's turn to go. He is another heroic character in this series, a teenaged king who does his best to do the right thing, and is the eldest son of Eddard Stark. After making some unpopular choices and breaking his vow to marry a Frey daughter, he pisses off some important allies but when it looks like he has successfully made amends with his "allies" (the Freys), Robb is betrayed by the Freys and Boltons. The Freys, Boltons, and some Karstarks kill Robb, his mother Catelyn, and their forces in a massacre known as 'the Red Wedding' near the end of this novel</span>.
</li><li> In <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">POV character Jon Snow, another heroic character and teenaged leader who does his best to do the right thing (and who is <em>also</em> another son of Eddard Stark and a half-brother to Robb Stark), is seemingly stabbed to death in a mutiny by a faction of his own men after a series of unpopular decisions he makes. This faction of Jon's officers are against many of his decisions, including his efforts to save everyone (including the wildlings, who many in the Watch hate) from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">threats to the realm</a>; his decision to ally with the wildlings so they can defend against the undead together; his efforts to shelter the many, many extra people at the Wall (as his opposers fear resource shortages); and choices he makes which ultimately compromise the Night Watch's political neutrality (aiding Stannis, intending to march against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> Ramsay Bolton). Jon is seemingly killed without learning the truth of his origins and despite many readers believing he's the "ice" half of the song alluded to in the series' title</span>.
</li><li> Elsewhere in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, the "fire" half — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daenerys Targaryen — another heroic POV character who is a young leader like Robb and Jon and is also trying to do the right thing, loses the power base she had spent the entire series building up after making too many unpopular decisions in the eyes of important factions. She narrowly escapes an assassination attempt on her life while her own nephew Aegon, previously having been assumed dead, is revealed to be alive and leading a campaign to retake Westeros, which is what everybody assumed Daenerys would do. If Aegon is who he says he is, his claim to the throne is actually even stronger than Daenerys' ever was, which leaves her fate questionable at best</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em> starts off as fairly episodic with a rather set dynamic between the characters, but after the sixth book one character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and dynamics between the remaining characters change completely.

It's not as dramatic a change as some, but it certainly impacts the series.

<ul><li> Each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em> ends with the whole premise of the show being completely changed.
<ul><li> Season 1 was all about the kid delinquents on Earth trying to survive and build a society on their own, while the adults remained on the Ark trying to keep the space station alive. By season's end, the kids' camp has been destroyed and the Ark has crashed to Earth, reuniting the kid and adult characters.
</li><li> Season 2 was all about the shifting conflicts and alliances between the Sky People, the Grounders, and the Mountain Men, with Clarke coming into her own as her people's leader. By season's end, the Mountain Men are all dead, Clarke has left her people, and the conflicts between human societies look to be overshadowed by the arrival of A.L.I.E., the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapShoot">demented A.I. program</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">destroyed the world 97 years ago</a>.
</li><li> Season 3 splits its focus between the A.L.I.E. plot and intensifying tensions between the Sky People and the Grounders. By season's end, both are seemingly resolved . . . only to reveal that a <em>second</em> wave of nuclear armageddon is about to arrive, giving everyone only a few months to live before the world ends . . . again.
</li><li> Season 4 is all about trying to find some way to preserve at least a small fraction of humanity after Apocalypse 2. By season's end, the new apocalypse has hit, the world's landscape has been completely altered, and what's left of humanity has had to isolate itself in a few secure locations, forming whole new societies from the mish-mash of people gathered there. Oh, and there's a six year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, resulting in <em>huge</em> changes to the characters and their relationships, and there's now a spaceship full of pre-apocalypse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicles</a> arriving to re-colonize Earth.
</li><li> Season 5 ends with perhaps the biggest shakeup yet, as Earth is finally left completely and utterly uninhabitable, and the only option remaining to our characters is to go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">suspended animation</a> and head off on a hundred year voyage to an alien planet. This is such a monumental change to the setting and premise of the show, this season closes with a title card proclaiming this the "End of Book 1".
</li><li> Season 6 is about the main characters trying to find a place in Sanctum, a city on a distant moon led by the theocracy of the Primes. The conflict has some rough similarities with Season 2 and Mount Weather, but with very different dynamics because of how the characters have changed since then. True to the show, it all get blown up at the end. All of the Primes except Russell are dead and Sanctum is in complete disarray, as the people now know that the Primes arent gods and the attempt to cover it up wasnt finished. Theres also the escape of Sheidheda, meaning another rogue AI is on the loose though no one knows where or for what. Finally, theres the appearance of Hope, Diyozas daughter, and the mystery of the anomaly taking the series closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFantasy">Space Fantasy</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> very often changed things up, but the final two seasons easily deserve special mention:
<ul><li> The seventh season saw Counter Terrorist Unit, or CTU, being decommissioned, a rogue Jack Bauer forced to ally with the FBI, longtime characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bill Buchanan</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tony Almeida</span> respectively dying and going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> to get revenge on the man who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> murdered his family</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> And somehow the final season managed to top it. It seemingly went with something closer to the status quo from early seasons in the series, with Jack and Chloe working with a newly recommissioned CTU in New York to protect a foreign president... then two thirds in <em><strong>completely</strong></em> threw it out the window <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with said President dying, Jack's love interest also dying, former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> President Taylor pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and siding with series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Charles Logan</a> to protect that masterminds behind both deaths to preserve a peace treaty, Jack snapping because of her betrayal resulting in him pulling one as well by going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">bloodthirsty rampage</a>, and Chloe now desperately trying to expose the former's cover up while stopping the latter</span>.
</li><li> The factions, their members, and the motivations changed between each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em>. The first season was simply dealing with the immediate need to understand the incident and deal with the displaced people. Season two was more of the long term effects of what the event would cause (Including many people who also wanted powers joining a clear Church of Scientology knockoff), and the government trying to use the abducted. Season 3 dealt with more violent actions and strife among the people. Season 4 began the introduction of the super-power serum to the general public (Although it had a 50-50 rate for powers or death), and the pseudo-religious movement to save the world. Season to season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em> had more changes season to season than most other shows, and it more or less worked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's one near the end of the first season that synchronized with the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the reveal that HYDRA has been hidden within S.H.I.E.L.D. since its inception, and that the Clairvoyant was actually a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who used his security clearance to stay ahead of the Team</span>. By the end of the season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Coulson has become director of S.H.I.E.L.D., which at the moment consists of himself, the five agents under his command, and the agent in charge of their one and only base of operations</span>. It's a pretty jarring change from the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentAgencyOfFiction">Government Agency of Fiction</a> we were introduced to when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> was first formed.
</li><li> Season Two then ended up with Terrigen being dropped into the ocean, meaning it will activate the Inhuman gene around the world, leading to a mass awakening of super powers in the MCU.
</li><li> Season Three ends with a six month <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, which reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Coulson has been replaced as Director, and Daisy has become a renegade vigilante</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em> did this quite regularly, in fact, one could say the only parts of the show where things <em>were</em> the same for a significant period of time was season one to mid-season two, and early- to late-season four. It even shook up the seeming entire premise of the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">a show about a spy</a>) in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodetwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodetwist">first episode</a> (a show about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a double agent father-daughter team</span>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> started with this as its premise, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> is thrown 300 years in the future to find his society has collapsed. He focuses on putting things back the way they were, but along the way things keep changing on him. The last season had them primarily planet bound in a mostly artificial solar system in another dimension.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> massively reinvented itself multiple times over its five seasons. The biggest of these events comes in the finale of season four, when when Angel and company <em>start <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> working for</span> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></em>. And in the comics, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire city of Los Angeles is plunged into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a></span>.
</li><li> For the first two seasons, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AntFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AntFarm">A.N.T. Farm</a></em> was about a group of child prodigies attending high school, but come season 3, and the setting is changed to a special boarding school for child prodigies, thus leaving out half the original cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> did this quite a lot. Notably, somewhere in the second season, Buster <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has his hand bitten off by a loose seal</span>. For the rest of the original show's run, Buster <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">does not have a hand (he wears a hook, prosthetic hand or nothing on his hand at all from time-to-time)</span>.

While Peter does return and Olivia does eventually recall the prior timeline, this change is never reverted. This means that a fair portion of the things we saw from the first three seasons, including character relationships, never happened or happened in wildly different ways. And the finale of the fourth season deals with the Fringe Team getting freed out of amber in 2036, after having been encased there 20 years earlier.

The season ends with the entire world finding out about zombies after thousands of people are deliberately infected by the virus. Season 4 opens with Seattle being closed off (complete with walls and soldiers) from the rest of the U.S. People inside try to handle life with the more elite folks carrying on like normal while the rest handle the changed dynamic. Liv can be completely open about what she is and folks just shrugging off her personality changes while Filmore-Graves continues to supply brains to the public.

Not only did it end 6 years of continuous storytelling and defeated the group of bad guys they'd been fighting for all that time, but due to a full on Alien Invasion being stopped, now Earth's culture and technology level begin steadily changing. It began with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">building a space colony to explore</a>, but following this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">they created their own Ranger Powers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">their higher education began reflecting a more galactic perspective</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">aliens began living on earth</a>, and more importantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">EVERYONE knows about who power rangers are</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em>, Season One ends with Cutter coming back from a trip to the past and realising that he has changed time so he is in an <em>entirely different timeline</em> and quite literally, nothing is the same any more, up to and including one of the main characters no longer existing. This isn't rectified (as yet) so the show changes format fairly drastically for Season Two.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> did this twice. Firstly in Series 6, where the crew lose the eponymous ship, and once again when they get it back at the end of Series 7  but all the crew that died in the very first episode are re-instated, so the ship is fully populated for the first time since that first episode. "Back to Earth" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seems to set this up by them going back to Earth, but it's another squid like the despair squid at the end of Series 5 (Back to Reality), which also appeared to set this up by them supposedly being in a video game the whole time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> in these cases</span>. Series 3 also changed the premise slightly, going from isolation to a more action-adventure show.

The same episode sees the last canon appearance in the franchise by one of the original cast other than Screech or Mr. Belding with a cameo by Slater. In hindsight it also serves as the last episode of Rachel Meyers, the only 'New Class' student character to have remained from the first couple of seasons.
</li><li> The Series 2 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> downplays this. On the one hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one character died, two others left for America and the rest of the group parted ways</span>. On the other hand, an entirely new cast was introduced for Series 3, thus restoring the <em>status quo</em> of a teenage school drama.

</li><li> The second season is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> for the first season villains at the Capua ludus, before Spartacus even arrived. It was filmed to give the actor who played Spartacus, Andy Whitfield, time to recover from cancer. He died anyway.
</li><li> The third season has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">a recast Spartacus</a> and his gladiators waging a guerrilla campaign against Roman soldiers. Actual gladiator matches make only cursory appearances after their saturation in the previous seasons, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and they actually destroy the Capua arena</span> halfway through the season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It ends with more than half the cast dead</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> had the team cast as outmatched, fish-out-of-water soldiers exploring a hostile and alien galaxy in a desperate fight against the galaxy's technologically superior rulers. About halfway through the show, Earth <em>became</em> the most powerful faction in the galaxy, and the tone of the show switched to Earth being sort of the galactic police, protecting the <em>rest</em> of the galaxy from external threats ranging from the interstellar mafia to alien invasions by hostile lego bugs or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a> crusaders. Which makes the idea of the Stargate program being a secret all the more ridiculous, really.
<ul><li> There was also a gradually growing international presence. At first only the US and presumably Canada knew about the SGC (Canada by default: a Canadian general officer is second in command of NORAD, and Canadian personnel work in Cheyenne Mountain and would eventually have to wonder what the hell was happening in the basement). Then the Russians had to become involved when they gained the second stargate, and were hesitant partners (and sometime rivals). Then the UN Security Council had to be informed when external threats became too obvious to hide. And by the end of the series multiple nations had starships and the Antarctica and Atlantis teams were fully multinational.
</li><li> Another big change came at the beginning of season nine, which introduced Cameron Mitchell as the replacement to Jack O'Neill, and reintroduced new team member (or tag-along, originally) Vala Mal Doran. Although Vala <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">temporarily transported to the Ori galaxy</a>, she returned, and both she and</span> Mitchell stayed for the rest of the series and into the movies. O'Neill continued to have guest spots and was mentioned regularly, but never returned as a main character.
<ul><li> That was also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>, as O'Neill was slowly phased out of the show per Richard Dean Anderson's request, so he could spend more time with his family. It also just made sense, as by that point Colonel O'Neill was in his 50s, an age at which you'd expect a highly decorated Air Force officer to be promoted to at least Brigadier General and no longer be personally involved in field operations.
</li></ul></li><li> While the cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> focuses more on the crew of the <em>Destiny</em>, a few episodes deal with Earth being in a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceColdWar">Space Cold War</a> with the Lucian Alliance, which has grown from an obscure criminal group to a major power in the galaxy. In fact, this is evidenced in the <em>Universe</em> pilot when an Earth battlecruiser is having trouble fighting off several Lucian Alliance Ha'taks, which have been cannon fodder for a long time now. This is clear evidence that the human leaders of the Lucian Alliance are not stupid and are perfectly willing to innovate (something the Goa'uld had trouble doing). Later on, the Lucian Alliance is conducting spy missions and terrorist strikes on Earth using advanced tech.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> did this with the first Borg invasion and battle of Wolf 359. Its effects are not felt within the remainder of the series proper, but they have long-lasting implications for the 24th century Trek universe, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. The Federation becomes far more militarized with a greater emphasis on preparing for new unknown threats. Starfleet balloons from barely being able to scrounge up a mere 39 ships to a massive fleet of thousands within a decade of the battle. This is what enables them to tackle the Borg in future engagements, and makes the Dominion conflict far less overwhelming for them than it would have otherwise been. Often "Wolf 359" is marked by characters as that tipping point that changed the Federation forever in much the same way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">9/11</a> is referenced in real life as the day that changed the psyche of the western world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> did this partially when they introduced the Dominion. Although it retained its interest in the Bajorans and Cardassians, the headaches of running the station, and the usual space opera elements, a hefty dose of war epic took over the rest of the series (and mixed in with all of the above).
<ul><li> In the DS9 novels, Bajor finally joins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>. Kira moves from a Militia Colonel to a Starfleet Captain, Ro Laren becomes chief of security and starts a relationship with Quark, Odo sends them a Jem'Hadar, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> First Minister Shakaar is killed off because he's possessed by evil aliens</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ben Sisko returns from the wormhole, but settles on Bajor with his family in unofficial retirement</span>. And that's just for starters.
<ul><li> The recent <em>TNG</em> novels are also working to make Nothing The Same Any More (for instance <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Borg eat Pluto</span>!</em> It's hard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> that sort of thing away later). Basically, with the Canon focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequels</a>, the 24th century has been left wide open for the novels to have some fun with.
</li><li> The even more recent TNG (and their associated crossover) novels have gone even further. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Federation and Klingons were devastated by a Borg invasion, but the Borg were ultimately defeated and are now gone, forever, with billions of former drones now having their own minds back and losing their tech (including Annika Hanson, now the ex-Seven of Nine)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Although not on TV, the setting of the new <em>Star Trek</em> MMO is based on this: the setting is the start of the 25th Century. The Klingons and the Federation are back at war, the Romulan Empire is barely holding together after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Romulus was destroyed as per the new Star Trek reboot)</span>, and more.
</li></ul></li><li> After poor ratings with the initial standard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> "just jet around exploring the galaxy" plot, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> did a similar "war epic" upgrade, sending the cast on a journey to battle a hostile alien race that had launched a massive 9/11-style attack on Earth.
<ul><li> This was then followed up with a confusing time-travel storyline, which led to another change to multi-episode stories.

He then proceeded to try to take over Mann Co — which had been willed to a third party over half a century ago — with an army of robots, which led to the mercs being re-hired by Saxton Hale to defend it. In the real world, though, not only are all of the original RED-vs-BLU maps still playable, more are still being developed and the short <em>Expiration Date</em> seems to be set when their rivalry was still going on.

The Summerset Isles were taken over by a faction of Altmer nationalists who annexed Valenwood and made Elsweyr a client state, and they started a devastating war with the Empire that saw the first Emperor killed and vast swathes of Cyrodiil ravaged, the armies beaten back at great cost and by signing a contentious truce. Hammerfell was given to the elves as one of the terms, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Redguards</a> kicked them out and Hammerfell is now independent of both entities. Morrowind was largely destroyed by a gigantic volcanic eruption, the Empire abandoned it and Dunmer refugees are now spread across the continent. Black Marsh also was taken over by nationalists and broke away to invade southern Morrowind as pay back for years of slavery and oppression. That leaves High Rock and Skyrim as the only stable Imperial provinces left, though High Rock is aligned with the Empire only tangentially and Skyrim is plunged into civil war as one of the other terms of the Empire's truce was a ban on Talos worship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus">something many Nords feel very strongly about</a>.

</li><li> The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> took with it the global status quo that had existed since the end of World War II, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell">leaving enemies and allies alike to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do next.</a> The United States in particular had to redesign their entire approach to foreign policy in the aftermath, which had previously been dedicated almost exclusively to countering the Soviets.
</li><li> The September 11th, 2001 terror attacks upon the World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. served as this for the United States in the post-Cold War era. It traumatized a generation, launched the country into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">several wars in the Middle East</a>, and its legacy continues to influence American culture and politics to this day.
</li><li> In US history, the Civil War certainly counts. The Republican party which had not existed before 1856 becomes the dominant political force for almost a century <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hqax');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4hqax" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hqax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Between 1860 and 1932 only two Democrats won a Presidential election: Grover Cleveland and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a></span> slavery ends, as does the sectional conflict that threatened to tear the nation apart at the seams. Oh and "These United States" (used with a plural) becomes outdated and is replaced by "The United States" (used with a singular). There is a reason why historians use one single term for all US history before 1861: antebellum.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5tr57');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5tr57" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5tr57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Latin for before the war</span> In fact, at the college level, US history is typically divided up into two broad subjects: The Colonial era through the Civil War and Reconstruction, and everything after up until the end of the Cold War or the start of the War on Terror. That this also happens to line up neatly with the Industrial Revolution coming to the US in the mid 1800s also helps.
</li><li> While technological innovations that are not (primarily) about war tend to make their impact seen over a period of time instead of instantly, few innovations have been as disruptive and revolutionary as the railway. Writers throughout the 19th century have noted this, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">bemoaned the lack of culture</a> the new mode of travel would bring, while others tended to focus on the positive aspects. With the arrival of the railroad to a town, what had once been an arduous (and dangerous) trip by stagecoach that took days became a short ride with a comfy train. Railroads <em>invented</em> the very concept of "commuting" and to this day inner ring suburbs in the US are known as "streetcar suburbs", because the expansion of streetcars made their existence possible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> writes in his autobiography how he had to make an arduous overland trip through what is now Panama when he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">posted in California</a> and several of his comrades fell sick and died, because the overland trip to the other coast would have been even worse. Grant would oversee the inauguration of a transcontinental railroad during his own term in the White House that made a monthlong matter of life and death into a matter of buying a ticket and spending a few days on a train. Since the introduction of rail travel, ordinary people went from never leaving home for matters other than war and pilgrimage to people who travel hundreds of miles for a weekend for fun. And while they will not necessarily take the train to do so anymore, this development started without a doubt with the railroad.
</li><li> For much of Europe, the fall of the western half of the Roman Empire was this. What had been the dominant hegemony for as long as anyone could remember was replaced with dozens of smaller, independent territories, a status quo which exists to this day. Indeed, people seemed to be in lesser or greater degrees of denial over it throughout the next half-millenium; numerous rulers (notably Charlemagne) were named 'Emperor' in futile attempts to reforge the previous system and Roman cultural markers continued (and still continue) to be shorthand for political legitimacy.
</li><li> The Oklahoma City Bombing was the worst terrorist attack on American soil until 9/11, but what truly shocked the nation was the revelation that it was two American citizens that had committed the crime, as upon until then, terrorism was still seen as something that could never be perpetrated by America's own citizens. McVeigh's trial, and subsequent conviction, caused the nation to realize terrorist threats could easily occur from within the country.
</li><li> The rise of the Internet. Without it, you'd probably be doing something much more important than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TvTropesWillRuinYourLife">reading this page</a>.
</li><li> High School Graduation. You spent the past four years with every kid in your graduating class, and you've spent 12 years with everyone that went to the same Elementary School with you. You finish your final exams, you have your last day of school, you go through your commencement ceremony, and you go to all the Graduation Parties and you have your parties. After the last party, you say your goodbyes and go to your car and then it hits you...you will never see these people again. Sure, you have your close friends that you'll (hopefully) continue to see, but the rest of the classmates that you spend years with are now out of your life. You may see one or two in passing every now and again, but it just won't be the same. This is especially true of people who move far away from where they went to school for college and/or their careers. More than a few of your classmates may end up living in the sand city/town they went to school in or move to a nearby area. But if you pack up and move far away for to start a new life somewhere, youre all but guaranteed to never see any of your old classmates ever again, unless they seek you out at some point.
</li><li> The death of someone close to you, especially a family member. Imagine someone who has always been around you, watched you grow up or grew up alongside you. Someone you shared deep moments with, someone you bonded with, someone who has helped shape your life in some regard or perhaps youve shaped theirs. And then one day, they pass away and you cant ever spend time with them ever again. You cant call them up, text them, hang out with them, get advice from them, see them at social events or gatherings. Theyre gone from your life and with them, a piece of you also disappears.
