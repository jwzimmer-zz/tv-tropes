<ul><li> In chapter 1, Nagi's first waifu was asked to cast a light spell to temporarily confuse a slaver and skill merchant that were trying to kidnap them in the middle of the night. She responded by summoning a light on par with what exists at the surface of the sun.
</li><li> Later, Nagi gains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Ninja Maid</a>, Aine, who has a skill that creates and expands muddy puddles.

Good thing that Nagi is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> who doesn't want to stand out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GarbageBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GarbageBrave">Garbage Brave</a></em> has Tsukuru's stand out almost instantly. His [Cooking] class sub-skills [Ignition] and [Dismantle], used for preparing meals, have the short line that they can be used <strong>on anything</strong>. When Tsukuru finds himself dumped in Bolf forest, a ridiculously overpowered dungeon, and finds himself face-to-face with a large feline monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">that sees him as lunch</a>, he uses [Ignition] to set its face on fire, and [Dismantle] when it has him pinned to the ground, reducing it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Ludicrous Gibs</a>.

Yeah, it's not instantly lethal to anyone. But killing all the plants on a planet (or even ecosystem) is deadly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">long run</a>. Not to mention that plants growing out of control overnight is pretty scary too. And if you live in a space station with nothin' but vacuum outside...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> just generally likes this trope:

</li><li> The show even managed to make "make it rain" directly lethal in the second season, when someone with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> got a rather fatal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertiaIsACruelMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertiaIsACruelMistress">physics</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop">lesson</a>. That's aside from using it to create spheres of water around people's heads so they drown.

Just as her enemy started mocking her about it she expanded the shield to cover nearly the entire cave. The enemy surrendered just seconds before his head was crushed between the shield and the wall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Yureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Yureka">Yureka</a></em>:
<ul><li> High-level player Roto knows a low-level shield spell which is too weak to block any of the magic he normally faces. Except that he can still use it to cast offensive spells on <em>himself</em> and deflect them at enemies, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic">a spell that's already been reflected can't be stopped by any kind of shield</a>...
</li><li> Later in the story he defeats a hacker with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic">by casting a "haste" spell on him</a>, making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop">Too Fast to Stop</a>. Both of these strategies are copied and used by other characters (the shield trick was broadcast on national television, while the haste trick was common knowledge among denizens of the Dragon Lands).
</li><li> Roto does this again by casting a "berserk" spell on <em>one of his allies</em>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachHimAnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachHimAnger">who dislikes hurting people but has absurdly high stats</a>.

<ul><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, Steely Dan's The Lovers is microscopic and can only exert force proportional to that. But it can attach itself to people's brains, and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">its user feels pain, the target of this ability feels the same pain, but amplified several times</a>. This allows him to take someone "hostage" and makes it nearly impossible to fight back against him without also harming the target as any injury great enough to incapacitate Dan would also kill the victim from the shock. Although Dan openly refers to his Stand as the weakest, the only way to defeat it was for Polnareff and Kakyoin to send their own Stands on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot">"Fantastic Voyage" Plot</a> inside the brain of the victim, Joseph, and during this time Dan was able to boss around Jotaro Kujo, owner of one of the most powerful Stands, and humiliate him in many ways.

<ul><li> Josuke Higashikata's Crazy Diamond has the power to return things and people to their original state, usually healing others' wounds (though he can't use Crazy Diamond on himself). Josuke twice destroyed an object and then reverted it to one piece around his enemy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">merging them with it and permanently immobilizing them</a>. He's also turned shards of glass into razor-sharp homing missiles by smearing his own blood on them and his target, then "healing" the two bits of blood so that the glass would hit the opponent on its way back.
</li><li> Tamami Koboyashi's Stand, The Lock, can amplify feelings of guilt, getting heavier the guiltier one feels. The most he uses it for is guilt-tripping people into giving him money, but if it gets heavy enough, the victim will <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicAssistedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicAssistedSuicide">attempt to take their own life</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to Josuke, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em>'s Giorno Giovanna possesses the Stand Gold Experience, which has the power to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLife">imbue life</a>" into an object by touching it (such as turning a brick into a snake, for example). While this seems useless in direct combat and he generally uses it to heal his teammates, if Gold Experience punches a person, the overload of life energy makes their mind accelerate to such a speed that their body can't even keep up, leaving them helpless as their face gets punched in for what feels like an infinity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJolion">JoJolion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tamaki Damo has the Stand Vitamin C, which makes other people's body's soft as putty. He then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">slices them apart with a folded up banknote while they're still alive, and destroys their vital organs while they melt into a puddle of goo</span>.
</li><li> Speaking of banknotes, the userless, parasitic Stand Milagro Man has the power to multiply money, doubling any cash spent or destroyed by the person under its effect. Seems like a pretty great thing to be "infected" by, until the victim realizes that <em>it can't be turned off.</em> As long as they're affected by Milagro Man, <em>any time</em> they get rid of money, <em>ever</em>, it comes back to them doubled. If the victim is too free with their spending, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism">they'll rapidly be literally buried and crushed to death by the weight of their cash</a>. And the only way to pass it on is to trick someone else into stealing and then <em>destroying</em> one of the bills (or other currency) created by the Stand, which is as difficult as you'd think - especially given that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">unusually for a Stand</a>, the existence of 'the Milagro Man' is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> in Morioh Town. And, of course, when the Stand is passed on, any money it created vanishes instantly.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Much like <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> also makes constant use of this trope.
<ul><li> The most famous example of this is Hisoka, who usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">overkills</a> his opponents using the power of chewing gum. That's not using chewing gum as a weapon, his ability is <em>literally</em> making his energy stretchy and sticky.
</li><li> The main character, Gon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">calls out his signature moves</a> before doing them. Unlike most shonen series, this is a liability in <em>Hunter X Hunter</em>, as it telegraphs what the user is going to do. But Gon is fully aware of this drawback, and takes advantage of it by not only deliberately <em>miscalling</em> his attacks so his opponents expect one thing but gets attacked with another, but also by exploiting the general rules of Nen regarding conditions and vows making Nen abilities stronger. Calling (or miscalling) his attacks and subsequently telegraphing his attacks to the enemy actually does make his Janken attacks more powerful due to the higher risk involved.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">medical ninjutsu</a> can be put to astonishingly lethal uses, like creating a chakra scalpel that cuts right through subcostals and important blood vessels while leaving the skin intact. Even the basic healing touch ability can, if used unskillfully or deliberately wrong, mess up a person's body in unspecified nasty ways, no doubt involving your cytoplasm turning into lethal poison.
</li><li> This is kind of how Gaara's power feels when you try to describe it outside the context of the show. "He has telekinetic control over sand."

Its targets include non-concrete objects such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire">Amaterasu</a>. And at high enough power, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was able to destroy the entire Konoha village in <em>one</em> blow</span>. He can also create a manifestation of his "pull" power outside of his own body. Ergo, he can basically create an artificial black hole.
</li><li> The Animal Path Pain, besides summoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">enormous monsters</a> that can easily knock down buildings, is rather strategic with <em>where</em> it summons them. In a fight against one of the ANBU ninja, it places a summoning seal <em>on the ninja's stomach</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">impaling him on the beak of the giant bird that is subsequently summoned</a>.

This ability allows Uryu to designate any two targets and completely reverse anything that has already occurred between the two of them.

In general, power sets in <em>One Piece</em> have a specific theme, but the sky's the limit with how one can use those powers, given enough experience with them. Devil Fruit powers canonically don't get stronger; their users just get more creative with them. One of the things this series is known for is its incredibly pragmatic use of weird and otherwise useless powers.
<ul><li> Nico Robin's Flower-Flower fruit gives her the power to sprout new limbs like flower petals. Thing is, they don't have to be attached to her body. Does her opponent have a neck? *snap*
</li><li> Kaku can turn into a giraffe, who makes use of his elongated neck to gain more momentum for his strikes and puts his elongated limbs to work by enhancing his strikes' power and reach; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind">Razor Wind</a> that could previously cut a man in half now can bisect entire buildings.

It turns out that he is unparalleled in taking out entire groups of people and destroying buildings without anyone noticing, as projectiles from firearms will also be totally quiet, as are people's screams when shot.
</li><li> Doflamingo's power revolves around strings. Sounds lame, but in practice these strings are sharp enough to slice through almost anything, and its strength can go up to 'utterly unbreakable' with the Birdcage technique. Even worse, he can attach these strings and forcefully take control of someone else's body.
</li><li> The villain from 10th movie, Shiki, has ability to levitate matter. He uses it to create giant lion heads by lifting masses of ground or water and ram them into enemies.
</li><li> Cracker has the ability to generate an unlimited amount of biscuits and, thanks to this power, has amassed a bounty of 860 million Berries. He was able to achieve this destructive power by creating a limitless army of biscuit soldiers—any adversaries he couldn't defeat through brute force, he defeated through attrition.
</li><li> The Big Mom Pirates have multiple candy generators like the one above, and they are all obscenely dangerous thanks to the properties they can imbue their materials with and the tricks they can pull with them. Whipped cream can become so sweet as to be dangerously caustic, just as an example.

</li><li> Goblin Slayer also frequently has Priestess use her barrier miracle in creative and unusual ways, such as using it to block the only exit to a fortress that Goblin Slayer had just set on fire so that the goblins inside would burn to death, or placing two barriers very close together to squish an enemy between then.

Metatron decides to retire and let someone else be the Face of God (mostly so he can get laid), and runs a contest for the seat; each angel gives an ordinary middle-school kid superpowers to win the contest, on the one condition that they apply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> in the form of a cute condition. Ueki in particular has the power to recycle (hand-sized only) trash... <em>by transmuting it into a giant tree</em>. Then there's the guy who can turn electricity into sugar and back by squinting his beady little eyes, which he uses to transmute batteries into sugary powder <em>and then into a cloud of lightning</em>.

Because his only ability is to heal (and even that causes him extreme pain), he is basically used as a drugged-up slave by the rest of his party. Eventually it turns out that "healing" in this setting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">at least when used by a Hero-level healer</a>, basically amounts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biomanipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biomanipulation">biomanipulation</a> (with a side-order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a>).

</li><li> There was one in-continuity story where he removed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">hi-tech glove</a> off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> by holding onto it and teleporting...and took all the flesh off the Skull's hand with it leaving nothing but bone.
</li><li> A much simpler, but effective strategy allowed Nightcrawler to defeat Omega Red, who was giving both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus">Colossus</a> a hard time.

Marrow wondered aloud how she could've done it, since the bones were still part of her body, and Shadowcat mentioned that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">were she so inclined</a>, she could pluck vital organs out of people's chests.
</li><li> In a 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> One-Shot comic, Kitty does exactly that, stopping a possessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/tMNfpXn.jpg">by pulling out her heart while the latter is halfway through transforming into her invincible diamond form<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> In another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> issue, Kitty sorrowfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Killed</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> by leaving her severed hand lodged in his brain.
</li><li> Noting also that Shadowcat, were she so inclined, can also <em>leave</em> a person behind as she's going with them through something solid. She's made the threat various times.She actually does this to the Hulk once, though Hulk being Hulk, it only stops him temporarily.
</li><li> In the Magik miniseries, the alternate version of Shadowcat defeats the alternate version of Nightcrawler in a sword fight... by <em>leaving her sword in his leg</em>.
</li><li> An alternate Kitty Pryde in <em>Exiles</em> killed an evil, alternate Wolverine by pulling his claws from his body, then removing other parts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath">offscreen</a>.
</li><li> Shinobi Shaw is a rare example of a villain with such powers - his powers are identical to Kitty's and squeezing people's hearts while still in their chest is his signature move.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMenAcademyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMenAcademyX">New X-Men: Academy X</a></em>:
</li><li> Elixir has the ability to control the biological structures of organic matter. Normally this power manifests as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a>, but he is also capable of using them to deliberately infect people with diseases. He's used this power to outright kill one villain, and gave another an inoperable brain tumor - in the shape of an X. Using his powers in this way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch">turns his normally gold skin metallic black</a>. In an alternate continuity story he teamed up with a mutant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">Touch of Death</a>, which when combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> caused parts of the victim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">continually die and regenerate</a>; a process said to be "quite painful".
</li><li> In the <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> Marvel Continuity, fellow teleporter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blink">Blink</a> demonstrates what happens if she closes one of her portals while somebody is halfway through. A fairly powerful (and ugly) villain gets literally turned to dust. When this version of Blink is brought back in <em>Exiles</em>, she (temporarily) dispatches a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute">Superman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a></em> by teleporting a few tons of sand inside him.
</li><li> Also in the X-Universe, we have (or, thanks to M-Day, had) Jubilee, who could make pretty little fireworks in the air. She often used it to blind flying enemies, causing them to crash. However, there was a lot of foreshadowing indicating that she was actually an inversion - she functionally had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun">The Power of the Sun</a> (indicated as a potential omega class) but a mental block kept her abilities at a relatively harmless level. This has actually been demonstrated on one occasion; when she thought Wolverine had been killed by the Mandarin, she absolutely lost her shit and let out a burst of energy so massive it <em>leveled the Mandarin's castle</em>. The place was so thoroughly wrecked that the Mandarin was never able to use it again.
</li><li> In one issue, she used her powers to run a fusion reactor by channeling her powers directly inside it.
</li><li> Even with the mental block restraining her powers to a mostly-harmless level, when Jubilee caught her parents' murderers, she noted that by putting her fingers to their ears and using her powers she'd be able to fry their brains. Though very tempted, she refrained from doing so.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dazzler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dazzler">Dazzler</a>:
</li><li> She originally had the power to convert sound into light. Then it turned out she could focus the lights into lasers. <em>Then</em> it was hinted that, given time, she could reach the point where she could convert <em>any</em> of the fundamental forms of energy into any other, effectively becoming a god.
</li><li> In her old solo series, she once channeled the ocean's roar into a beam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">strong enough to stun</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a>.
</li><li> The Klaw is made of soundwaves. Naturally, it didn't end well for him when he fought Dazzler.
</li><li> There's also the fact that the word "light" can be interpreted fairly loosely, and technically refers to any form of electromagnetic radiation... including gamma rays and micro waves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman">Iceman</a>:
</li><li> He usually slides around on ice slides, turns into ice, and throws ice spikes at people. When Emma Frost took over his mind, she was able to get him to turn his entire body into water, enter a river, and come out downstream perfectly fine. She also used moisture to make weapons more effectively, and turned Iceman into a gas as well as a liquid. The entire X-Men Gold team wasn't able to stop him. If he gets hurt as ice and turns back to normal, it heals. Bobby has been confirmed as an "Omega-level" mutant, which, while never defined, seems to basically amount to "demigod". If only he wasn't so lazy. One enduring effect of this revelation is that Bobby has become even more of a go-to candidate than Wolverine to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">not-quite-kill</a> to show how dangerous a villain is, since he can be literally vaporized and still reassemble himself back into water, then ice, then flesh.
</li><li> In the story in which he's a teacher at Wolverine's school, Logan asked him to start being serious. He soon delivers - in the form of <em>multiple ice clones</em>.
</li><li> <em>X-men</em> ally Sage's power revolved around helping other mutants control their and strengthen their powers. <em>X-men</em> enemy Fabian Cortez had the same ability, but would push a mutant's power out of control, killing them. Cortez once did this to <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a></strong>, and almost succeeded in killing him. Unfortunately for all involved, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">this made Magento even more powerful when he recovered</a>.
</li><li> One-time X-Man Dr. Cecilia Reyes initially had a personal forcefield that would protect her from harm (mostly). With a little practice, she discovered she could make the forcefield spikey...
</li><li> A <em>self-inflicted</em> example was Sally Floyd's mutant daughter, Minnie, who developed the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinSickness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinSickness">reverse her age</a>. Since this manifested when she was only two years old, she had no way to control it, regressing until she turned back into a fetus and died.
</li><li> The Morlock Masque has the ability to change anyone's appearance by touch. Doesn't sound so scary—until you consider what happens if he decides your appearance doesn't need to include a mouth or a nose.

<ul><li> Minor villain Mr. Brownstone aka Garrison Klum has the ability to teleport matter...but only a few grams at a time. Since he works as a drug dealer, a few grams of heroin teleported straight to the heart is all he needs to incapacitate or kill someone. On a more mundane but equally criminal front, it can be used to immediately get a customer high by teleporting a smaller dose of heroin directly into their bloodstream.
</li><li> Francis Klum, the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mysterio">Mysterio</a> and the younger brother of the aforementioned Mr Brownstone. Francis has teleportation abilities far stronger than that of his brother and can use them to far deadlier effect as he isn't limited to teleporting a few grams of matter. His feats include teleporting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a>'s mask into Spider-Man's neck and killing his brother Garrison by <em>teleporting into his body and blowing him up</em>.
</li><li> Many people think that the villain Shocker is a loser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> and that his sonic gauntlets are useless. These people are unaware that the gauntlets can kill or deafen people and cause buildings to collapse if he cranks them up high-enough. He's canonically used them to take out <em>the Punisher</em> in a single hit. The only reason Shocker isn't an a-list, city-wrecking bad guy is because he's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional">Consummate Professional</a> and prefers to keep his head low. Blowing up buildings doesn't pay, and while murder <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">can</a></em> pay it also draws a lot more hero attention than mere theft.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman">Invisible Woman</a> (a.k.a. Sue Storm):
<ul><li> Quoted above, she has the ability to turn invisible and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">create force-fields</a>. Humble as these abilities appear, Sue is regarded as the most powerful member of the Fantastic Four. She has developed some brilliant applications of her force fields ranging from creating steps to walk on air to massive battering rams. She can, as she stated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005">movie</a>, create a force field inside a body and expand it with lethal - and messy - results. 
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies">Marvel Zombies</a></em> comics, she demonstrated that you kill a zombie by destroying its brain by going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> on a zombie She-Hulk.
</li><li> Her invisibility extends to those around her as well. And while not lethal, she was able to blind a pack of zombies by making their optic nerves invisible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">She also once threatened a classroom full of teenagers that she could make their clothes invisible.</a>
</li><li> Also she could make the skin, flesh and skull of a person's head become invisible, allowing ordinary sunlight to directly reach a person's vulnerable brain, rapidly causing heat stroke and slowly lobotomizing them.
</li><li> Invisibility could also make a section of the Earth's Ozone Layer become invisible (as in it does not distort or deflect solar radiation), allowing the full might of the Sun to burn whatever she wanted.
</li><li> In Four, at one point she creates a forcefield surrounding herself and her family, protecting them from the villain. Then she creates another forcefield encompassing her and the villain. Then she starts extending the first forcefield, crushing the villain into the second one until he surrendered.
</li><li> The various lethal uses of her powers can be frequently be seen being used by the Super-Skrull (he has all the powers of the F4). He of course doesn't have Sue's good nature, so he doesn't hold back as much as she does. Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em> (a book about a reality hopping super hero team), they once visited a reality where Sue was the leader of Hydra and showed how horrifying her powers can be.
</li><li> Sue (while evil) also once threatened to kill a man by creating a tiny force field in his carotid artery, which would cause a massive and probably fatal stroke.
</li><li> Sue Richards' force fields are hyperspace-sourced. Hyperspace is, in the Marvel Universe, the source of all energy. This allowed her to destroy a <em>Celestial's</em> physical form. The Celestials are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> Precursors.

<ul><li> Most of them have pretty useful powers, but the most dangerous/powerful member of the team is canonically <em>Door Man</em>, a living portal whose powers have a fairly short range. He's capable of sending attacks right back at enemies and has also used his powers to help break into maximum security areas. In one infamous incident, his powers actually killed one of his own teammates <em>by accident</em>; a villain tossed a sai at Door Man who instinctively activated his powers, unaware that Grasshopper was standing right behind him. The weapon proceeded to fly harmlessly through Door Man and impale Grasshopper through the skull, an event so traumatic it sent Door Man into a deep depression where he refused to use his powers and tried to drive Squirrel Girl off the team because he was terrified of accidentally hurting her.
</li><li> Door Man's powers have been revealed to work by tapping into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Darkforce Dimension</a>, the same dimension that turn Marcus Daniels into the insane supervillain Blackout. That means that he essentially sends objects and people that pass through him to a nightmarish world of pure energy and yanks them back. This means that he could theoretically <em>leave</em> people there if he wanted to (though Door Man would never do so; he's far to much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>).

When Martian Manhunter went insane and became the nearly unstoppable Fernus the Burning (as the name implies he no longer has the Martian vulnerability to fire, and is still as strong and fast as Superman while also having psychic powers), Batman's contingency plan was Plastic Man. Incidentally, Batman's contingency against Plastic Man himself is even simpler: Don't let Plastic Man become evil in the first place. All of Plas's vulnerabilities come from him being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> with a strict code of honor; otherwise, even Batman has no idea how to stop him.

</li><li> The comic also has the "inverted healing powers" trick. Leetah is basically sickened by the idea and uses her power in that way only very, very rarely as a last resort, but Winnowill takes it and turns it up to eleven, especially post-timeskip when she's shown using her magic to casually turn normal animals into monsters and on at least one occasion kills several humans on the spot by turning her flesh-warping powers on <em>them</em>.

The class includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">mortal incarnation</a> of Hestia, the Goddess of the Hearth (who can promote fertility and forge harmony within a troubled family).

And of course, the digger can take people with him underground... and leave them there.
</li><li> The terrifying potential of the food-creator goes unmentioned - this isn't a horror-comic, after all. It's clear, though, that his powers change the consistency of the object, since he's seen eating rocks despite having non-superpowered teeth. So imagine if he just went and transformed your body into something with the consistency of whipped cream...
</li><li> Incidentally, the titular Rainmaker that the class and the episode is named for, was one of these too. The first superpowered individual to appear with a 'harmless' power - to make it rain, or STOP raining. Useful for helping out farmers, but otherwise no biggie. So the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> spirits him away to a secret lab to use him as a guinea-pig in order to perform basic research on the hows and whys of superpowers, just 'cuz he can't fight back effectively.

</li><li> Minimus Ambus is a "point-one-percenter", a rare Transformer born with a much more powerful spark than most, which normally means the bot will be bigger, tougher, and stronger than his peers. Alas, Minimus is a variant called a "loadbearer" who is actually tiny by Cybertronian standards, and his only gift is being able to support far more mass than he would normally be able to. However, it turns out that this includes the ability to support and power a far bigger <em>body</em> than he was born with, allowing him to don a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">mechanical suit</a> and become the Grade A Badass known as Ultra Magnus. And in a later issue he has an even <em>more</em> massive body constructed, making him the absolutely gigantic Maximus Ambus.
</li><li> Chromedome is a "mnemosurgeon", a useful if not dangerous skill that allows him to probe the memories of deceased transformers for information. But later issues reveal that a skilled menmosurgeon like him can also <em>rewrite</em> memories, erasing them and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">effectively brainwashing</a> transformers...and Chromedome used to do just that under the corrupt Senate, an act for which he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">desperate to atone</a>. And later still we meet someone whose mastery of mnemosurgery is so great that he can cause transformers to <em>forget</em> how to transform, so when they try they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">turn inside out</a>.
</li><li> In one issue, Trailcutter claims to be this. His power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">making forcefields</a>, and much like The Invisible Woman above he once claimed he could put one inside someone's body and destroy them. He may have been bluffing - he was actually without powers at that moment and successfully psyched an enemy out with this claim. But from the way his powers work, it seems entirely possible that he was telling the truth and is just too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> to ever actually do that to someone.

It's called that because the supposedly-weaponless, pacifist humans used their light-sail drives (powered by giant lasers) and mass-driver mining tools (fires hyper-velocity ores around the asteroid belt, both burning off the impurities and getting the ore to market) to utterly trounce the hyper-militarized Kzinti empire. This theme is repeated in most of the <em>Known Space</em> stories; various harmless tools always seem to have a setting that makes things die horribly. Flashlights with adjustable focuses, starting diffuse as "light a room" and dialing all the way down to "laser beam". Communication lasers that have a setting for communicating with things in orbit, which just so happens to burn holes in anything not in orbit. Disintegrator mining tools, which work just as well on flesh as they do on rocks. Humans never seem to have dedicated weapons, just loads of useful tools that ALSO can kill things.
</li><li> Many of those belong to Nessus, a Pierson's Puppeteer. Louis specifically mentions that Nessus could point to every single piece of equipment the expedition has and say "That is not a weapon, we brought it for thus-and-so reason," but there are very few pieces of equipment that couldn't be <em>used</em> as a weapon, somehow. This, among other reasons, is why he christens their ship <em>Lying Bastard</em>.
</li><li> The Kzin planet Warhead got new management ... and a new name ... when the Human planet Wunderland built, and transported into the system, a gigantic version of the digging tool. Actually, <em>two</em> versions; the normal digging tool operates by temporarily "suppressing the charge on the electron", but the Wunderland Treatymaker included another beam, that does the same thing for the <em>proton</em>. The two beams hit Warhead's surface about ten miles apart, resulting in what's described as a "gigantic, solid bar of lightning" between the two points, and the production of the planet Canyon's most distinctive and eponymous feature.

It helps that the Surgebinder is immune to their own Adhesion.
</li><li> Windrunners and Skybreakers also have the Surge of Gravitation, allowing them to redirect, amplify or lessen the effects of gravity on anything they can touch. The standard use of this is to change gravity to allow people to fly (or run on walls and ceilings indoors), allowing for fantastic mobility in or out of flight. It also can be used to send giant stones "falling" horizontally along the ground into groups of enemies or to send people straight up into the air until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Stormlight</a> used in the Surge runs out, causing them to return to normal gravity and fall to their deaths.

Waste can be turned into food, structures can be built from wood before being cast into stone, wood can be produced in areas where it is scarce and so on. Soulcasters are relatively rare and is generally seen as a holy power, so they are use more or less exclusively for logistical purposes. However Jasnah starts using it to turn her enemies into things people aren't generally made of like stone or smoke, or condensing the air into a wall of pitch then soulcasting a bit of fire into it.

<ul><li> The 3rd edition features quite a few spells that summon or conjure something somewhere within the spell's range. Sadistic players could easily confound their DM by choosing "Inside that orc"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26ewp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26ewp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26ewp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> this actually required the players and the GM to ignore the line under general spellcasting rules that you had to conjure creatures and objects in empty spaces</span>. The next edition amends most conjuring rituals to say the caster needs to be able to see the location they are targeting, which mostly solves this (since if you can already see inside the highwayman's lungs, any sadistic spellcasting is purely recreational).
</li><li> A particularly famous version involves the lowest-level druid spell Create Water. The spell's evident purpose is to provide clean water for the adventuring party or maybe quench a small fire. Even at the lowest caster-level the spell creates a gallon of water: more then enough to give even large enemies a lethal case of hydrocephalus.
</li><li> The rules also state you cannot summon a creature outside of its habitat. This is primarily to stop people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">dropping whales on bandits</a>. From 100 feet up.
</li><li> Shrink Item. Combined with "Fly", allows to drop something really heavy on the enemy.
</li><li> The "Locate City" spell immediately notifies the caster of the location of a city within 10 miles. Seems harmless enough. With the right combination of reasonably minor feats (and a cooperative GM), it can become a nuclear-esque blast that kills everything within 10 miles and then resurrects them as Wraiths.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yvp0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yvp0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yvp0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This one actually takes some explaining to make sense. As stated, the spell Locate City targets a city and notifies you of its location. Then, there's a feat that allows you to tack exactly 1 ice damage on to any spell you cast. There's another feat that states that if you do any ice damage to anything, you tack another 2d6 or so on top of it. Finally, there's a final feat that states that if you kill anything using a spell, in 24 hours it rises as a wight. Since the spell targets the entire city, it deals 2d6+1 cold damage to everything in the "area of effect" (the city). That's enough to kill most low-level non-adventurers, thus causing them to come back as wights. It's since been errataed that before the "Tack 1 ice damage" feat can add an ice damage, the spell has to deal at least 1 damage to begin with, rendering this tactic unfortunately moot. It can also be done using the Explosive Spell feat, which pushes all enemies within the area of effect to the outside of it-dealing damage based on how far they go. Given a spell with an area of effect measured in the miles, the resulting blast will kill just about anything.</span>
</li><li> The first level spell Hypnotize is intended to be essentially a Jedi hand wave, but the wording made it so that even after the spell wore off the subject was "one step more friendly" in the regards of whatever you hypnotized them to do. <em>D&amp;D</em> quantifies friendliness, and explicitly states that the highest level, Fanatical, is enough to make people throw themselves in front of rampaging dragons for you. A first level character given enough time and castings can brainwash entire continents into being their die-hard lackeys.
</li><li> Under some interpretations of the rules, a Cleric with healing spells can be the most dangerous thing to undead, as healing magic causes them to take damage. This same rule is explicitly described as one of the few sure ways to kill a Nilbog, a (non-undead) creature that actually <em>gains</em> hit points every time it sustains damage. Healing, on the other hand, does it injury.
</li><li> Clerics in general can come off as a Lethal Harmless Class to people who are only tangentially familiar with the game and assume that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember">Support Party Members</a> used primarily for healing the party. In reality, clerics are surprisingly versatile casters that can specialize in different things depending on the Domain of their deity, and that their spell repertoire includes such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">lovely</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">totally not horrifying</a> spells as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Inflict Wounds, Harm, and Contagion</a>, as well as the ability to summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">The Undead</a>.

There's absolutely nothing to stop it being cast on a weapon, thus turning it into a make-shift magical item (necessary for killing certain enemies like Ghosts and Daemons). Thanks to bad wording, the first edition was an auto-kill spell. "The object glows brightly for one hour, and then vanishes."

</li><li> Chaff Storm disrupts all communications for an area up to 40 miles around the user, which is useful for keeping enemies for calling in backup.

To note:
<ul><li> "Mill deck" is a catch all term used to describe a deck that negates damage and forces the opponent to discard cards from their deck. This is their entire win strategy. Generally speaking, both of these are viable tactics, but are used to hinder the opponent rather then outright destroy them. Combined, however, these effects quickly deplete your opponents deck to zero (which is an automatic loss) all the while countering, negating, and generally obstructing all sources of damage they attempt to put out. Only certain cards can even hinder this strategy in any form and most decks won't be running those since they are so situational. Made even more terrifying by the fact that being "milled" canonically equates to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raped</a> into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a> - what with lovely spells like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83597">Glimpse the Unthinkable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370663">Traumatize<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=188962">Nemesis of Reason<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Many "instant win" decks revolve around drawing several specific cards and using them to essentially nuke your opponent before the match even begins. Needless to say the key cards tend to be pretty unassuming at a glance. One infamous example is the "Vault Deck" - a combo which uses <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=protean%20hulk">Protean Hulk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which summons creatures from your deck when it dies) and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=FLASH">Flash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (a cheap spell which summons creatures that instantly die if you don't pay a reduced cost). You Flash the Hulk, let it die, then use its ability to summon up four <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=disciple+of+the+vault">Disciple of the Vault<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, four <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mtgvault.com/card/shifting-wall/STH/">Shifting Wall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and four <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mtgvault.com/card/phyrexian-marauder/VIS/">Phyrexian Marauder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since you're paying 0 mana, the Walls and Marauders become eight 0/0 artifact creatures. The 0/0s die immediately due to having 0 toughness which causes each of the Disciples to deal 8 damage to the enemy for 32 damage (starting hp is 20) killing the opponent instantly. With the right back up cards this can be done on "turn 0" (essentially the setup phase before the fight begins) ensuring your enemy can't even respond to it.

Why bother carrying a weapon when you can slap someone across the face and seal their mouth, eyes, and nose shut, or just open a gaping hole in their skin? Or, if that lacks ambition, fuse a dozen or so victims together into an elephant-sized monstrosity known as a <em>vozhd</em>, and turn it loose on your enemies.

</li><li> Pretty much all shield-type weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> work this way, wherein contact with the shield damages enemies just as if you shot them, but it's usually an inefficient way to go about it.

</li><li> Elizabeth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> has the ability to open up tears in reality to alternate universes, essentially making windows to other worlds.

Maximum deadliness occurs when she opens up a window to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a tornado.

<ul><li> Reimu Hakurei possesses the ability to fly, which is incredibly lame when considering nearly <em>everyone else</em> in the series can fly on top of whatever power they already possess. Except that Reimu can also, at a whim, <em>fly away from reality</em>, making herself completely invulnerable, and if she didn't place a time limit on it (fighting in Gensoukyou being largely a game) she would never lose.
</li><li> Kogasa Tatara has the power to surprise people, which is unbelievably lame. Except that she managed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">surprise <em>the player</em> by reappearing as the Extra Stage midboss, complete with the required massive power boost</span>. While she hasn't done anything else with it yet, fans have logically deduced that, as long as it is surprising enough, she could do almost anything she wants. It can be safely said that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">few people expected her to appear again in stage 3 of Ten Desires</span>.
</li><li> Subverted by Yuuka Kazami, who has the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">manipulate flowers</a>, which is as weak as it sounds. She can't make flowers bloom in an opponent's throat to stop their breathing or make them grow to giant size and attack people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a>, or anything like that, she can just make them grow faster and healthier (as far as we know). She's still an outrageously powerful character despite this. She's simply got strong magic unrelated to her flower-manipulation, and is generally assumed to be physically powerful as well. It's the prime reason fans don't doubt her claims of being one of the strongest Youkai in existence.
</li><li> Lily White is a fairy whose power is to announce the coming of spring. This also sounds unbelievably lame but she can somehow use this power to attack, so apparently riddling you with magical bullets is as good a way as any to announce the coming of spring.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki">Mamizou Futatsuiwa</a>'s ability is "disguising things and herself". Although it's a useful ability to have, it doesn't sound too useful for battle, and Mamizou is more of a trickster than a combatant. However, her "disguises" actively change the properties of an object or a person. In the fighting games, she is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">transform</a> an opponent into a harmless animal to incapacitate them, as well as transform her tanuki minions to give them new abilities.
</li><li> Yukari Yakumo's power is the "manipulation of borders", which on the whole is probably not this trope - while the extent of Yukari's ability is vague, if taken to its fullest possible extent, it's likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warping</a> with the potential to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the end of the world</a>. What <strong>is</strong> this trope is her usage of the most common application of her power, the creation of portals, to the point that summoning <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain">a literal train</a></strong> from the Outside World to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">run over her opponent</a> is practically Yukari's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>. And if she has enough knowledge of the Outside World to always know where trains are and to be able to pull them out of reality at will, there is nothing to indicate that she couldn't grab something even more dangerous - such as, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">an atom bomb</a> - if she really wanted.

<ul><li> The Medic's signature weapon, the Medigun, seems harmless enough; it heals teammates and, after a while, it builds up an "Ubercharge" that turns the healing target invulnerable for eight seconds. It's not so harmless when the Medic pops the charge on, say, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Heavy</a>, who can and most likely <em>will</em> mow down more enemies than he could without the Ubercharge.
</li><li> Pyro's airblast is fairly simple—for the price of some of your primary ammo, you fire a blast of compressed air. It does no damage whatsoever and has a fairly short effective range and a long recovery time before you can use it again. What good is it, then? Well, its main power can be described as 'pushing things.' Like, say, pushing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">an enemy rocket back at them</a>. Or pushing enemies away from important targets, off cliffs, and into oncoming trains. Or 'pushing' a fire off a teammate to save their life. The airblast is arguably the ability with the greatest variety of uses in the game.

But the inverse is also true - healing hurts them, and it isn't stopped by the Resistance stat, so even weak heal spells can kill them outright. Since healers are usually held back by their restrictions (they only get a pittance exp from healing, and no mana), this becomes a very potent grinding spot for them.
<ul><li> Anyone in a Disgaea game who is in the midst of a grueling Item Dive can position their units all around these panels. Take out any units that can hit you with healing, then just have your units beat <em>themselves</em> up so you heal your own army without spending a single SP point.

</li><li> "Rage Potion" increases a target creature's attack by five points, but lowers its health by the same amount. This is a useful tool in eliminating creatures with low health, but it can also be used on a Voodoo Doll, simultaneously hurting the enemy and boosting the Doll's attack power.

Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> the school is mocked by practitioners of other schools, with Restoration master Colette Marence supposedly being mocked and borderline bullied by some colleagues at the College of Winterhold. However, in several games, spells that absorb something from a target and transfer it to the caster are classified as Restoration, which means that you could use Restoration to horrifically drain a target of life while making yourself healthier, vampire-style. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, all such effects are reclassified into Destruction, but multiple mods carry on the horrifying legacy of Restoration. <em>Ordinator</em>, one of the most popular <em>Skyrim</em> perk overhauls, includes ways for Restoration to both <strong>inflict</strong> diseases instead of curing them and have normal healing spells <strong>harm</strong> hostile targets instead (presumably by wreaking havoc on the organism with the sheer overload of life force).

<ul><li> One scene depicts three of the planeswalkers in battle with a horde of <em>nim</em> (aka zombies). Elspeth's ability to fight is fairly obvious, as she is a highly-trained knight and quite adept with a blade. Koth, a geomancer, is also quite nasty in a fight, due both to being built like a rock (literally) and being able to conjure/hurl boulders at his foes at a whim. Then we have Venser, effectively the geek of the trio. No weapons, no real fighting skills, and his only ability seems to be teleporting, which doesn't seem useful against zombies...then he takes hold of two of them, teleports <em>with</em> them a few hundred feet in the air, then immediately 'ports back down <em>without</em> them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityIsAHarshMistress">Gravity</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">ensues</a>.
</li><li> Far earlier, in one of the Mirrodin Block novels, the protagonist is given a series of one-use magical artifacts, one of which will teleport her to any place she chooses to name. In a pinch, she realizes that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">inside of a person</a>" is a place...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, your powers are determined by your Title, which follows the format X of Y (as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Gent of Piss</a>). While the Aspect can be any monosyllabic concept like Mind, Hope, or Heart (most of which sound non-lethal), the actual Class can modify a non-lethal Aspect into a dangerous force.
<ul><li> For example, a Prince of Mind would, based on game mechanics, be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">destroy the brains of his enemies</a>, and a Knight of Heart would be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">weaponize souls</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inversely</a>, a potentially-deadly Aspect, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Rage</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Void</a>, could be turned passive by its class. For example, an Heir of Void would just be able to make things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">near-impossible to find</a>. Of course, "things" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">could include part of enemies or entire hostile armies</a>.
</li><li> For specific examples, we have John, the Heir of Breath. Doesn't sound that impressive compared to Time or Space manipulation. How about creating cyclones over lava, turning them into <em>fire tornadoes</em> with which to strike your enemy? Generating a windstorm so intense it <em>drills through continents</em>? Global hurricanes within seconds? Turning into wind to make yourself untouchable? It's quite a useful and versatile power, really.
</li><li> There's also Dirk, the Prince of Heart. In Sburb's mechanics, Heart = Soul. Dirk is therefore able to <em>tear a person's soul from their body</em>. Yikes. Going by this logic, the often by fandom portrayed as innocent and cute, Nepeta as the Rogue of Heart is able to <em>yank a soul out of a body and then redistributing it under her allies</em>.
</li><li> And then there are the troll blood traits. Some are awesome: immense telekinetic powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>, and the like. Then there's Tavros, who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">control animals</a>. The lethal part is that it affects enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> generated by Sburb/Sgrub, like imps and ogres, enabling Tavros to make them <em>his</em> minions and breeze through the game without ever touching his class powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he casually mentions to Jade that he can command <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">First Guardians</a> this way. Yes, <em>talking to animals</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a> in <em>Homestuck</em></span>.
</li><li> Light is similar. Light symbolizes fate, knowledge, and literal light. Sounds pretty weak, right? It has so far been used to navigate the lack of physical space between universes, kill enemies without its user lifting a finger by robbing them of their fortune, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raping</a> someone into insanity. And <em>all</em> Light heroes have access to these powers, just to different extents.
</li><li> Jack Noir, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">obtaining power of a First Guardian</span> not only get a ton of different deadly powers, but manage to weaponize non-lethal one - he used ability to turn his own body into a portal, to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">redirect bullets, aimed at him, in Dave's back</span>.
</li><li> Jade has teleporting powers, similar to Jack's. She once threatened to kill Roxy by teleporting her intestines out of her body.

This does not sound impressive when compared to his other power (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">electrokinesis</a>). However, this means that he is never unarmed.

Emily doesn't know any combat spells, and specializes in spells with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">useful effects such as making a perfect cup of tea.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emily's condition is Heart's Guardian; anyone who cherishes the duelists can stand by them in the fight, which means her friends can join in. Emily dodges the blast of fire Lilith throws at her and uses her friends to gain an advantage, then materializes warm, steaming tea directly into Lilith's lungs. Emily then humiliates her opponent further by saving her life using CPR to get the fluid out of her lungs, putting Lilith in debt to Emily.</span> <br/><br/>Emily's <em>real</em> power is that she literally doesn't think like other witches; since magic destroys whatever it is written on when cast, and most human mages memorize spells, they just end up going nuts.

</li><li> Water bending can also be applied in a rather nasty fashion known as <em>blood bending</em>, essentially puppeteering someone through the liquids in their body. Hama used it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicAssistedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicAssistedSuicide">try to force Aang and Sokka to kill each other</a>, while Yakone appears to have attempted to <em>crush Aang's organs</em>.

</li><li> Another example of water powers that aren't harmless but could have been infinitely worse: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> has a character called The Liquidator, who has apparently complete control of water. He can generate it, boil it, and turn it into "hard water" — a yellow glue-like substance. Luckily for everyone involved, <em>Darkwing Duck</em> is a children's series, so we never get to see what might have happened if Liquidator had decided to turn the water of a living being's body into hard water... or boil it...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:

And he takes out a mechanical baddie by similarly reaching into its head and <em>pulling out</em> what's inside.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>:
<ul><li> Given that he has super-speed, his secondary ability goes mostly unnoticed: he can vibrate at a superhuman speed. Said vibrations create an unstable resonance which can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">cause things to explode</a>.
</li><li> To say nothing of running several times around the planet in a few seconds to gain enough momentum to punch Braniac out of Lex Luthor.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode also features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expies</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins">Wonder Twins</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em> with their same powers. Whereas the Wonder Twins were near-useless and rather incompetent, this episode shows how their powers (turning into various forms of water and turning into animals) could be used to easily infiltrate an office building and hold its leader hostage.

<ul><li> Mr. Pidgeon can control pigeons. Even without taking into account him making them strong and tough enough to dent a metal door <em>severely</em>, this allows him to cause chaos all over Paris, as it has <em>millions</em> of the feathered fiends.
</li><li> The Bubbler uses his bubbles to enact a mass kidnapping of all the adults in Paris.
</li><li> Lady Wi-Fi can "pause" people and teleport between phones, and very nearly reveals Ladybug's identity.
</li></ul></li><li> Levitating objects with magic is the stock ability of every unicorn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, and thus is a mundane part of every day life. Of course, this includes other ponies, since Rarity levitates her little sister around and Twilight Sparkle levitates her friends on a few occasions. Then "Magic Duel" airs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Trixie</a> displays just how terrifying this ability can be if misused, since there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">really doesn't seem to be anything a pony can do about it if levitated against their will</a>. It's somewhat mitigated by the fact that most unicorns aren't strong enough to lift a full-grown pony. (Twilight is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>, Trixie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> to her at the beginning, or at least <em>she</em> sees it that way... a background unicorn once needed Rainbow Dash's help to <em>open a jar</em> after her magic couldn't do it.)
<ul><li> Though not <em>lethal,</em> Rarity's magical talent seems to revolve around beautifying things; she can be a living radar for the gems she uses in her clothing-making, she once created special effects for a fashion show of hers... you'd think she wouldn't come in handy when a large tree knocked over by a storm crashed through a house. However, turning a huge tree into several cute little topiaries made them easy to remove. It's all in how you use what you've got!
</li></ul></li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, as he himself admitted, has mostly defensive powers. He can generate a force field and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">heal with his spit</a> on top of having a shield as his personal weapon. However, he can make his force field grow spikes and throw his shield with enough force to slice a stone pillar in half a la Captain America.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em>, Nightcrawler, whose only mutant power is teleportation, puts it to devastating use against Spiral, by using it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut">Portal Cut</a> her robotic arms. Then he implicitly reminds her that he could easily do the same to her <em>organic</em> ones.

<ul><li> Honeybees have the ability to vibrate their flight muscles and raise their body temperature, which they usually use to keep themselves warm during the winter. Japanese honeybees have figured out how to weaponize this against Japanese hornets (who have exoskeletons the bees' stingers can't pierce, but also can't survive as high a temperature as a bee can) by attaching themselves to the hornet <em>en masse</em> and heating themselves up, frying the hornet from the outside in.
</li><li> A gun with blanks. Blanks are only safe from a few feet away from the barrel.
<ul><li> In 1984, on the set of the short-lived CBS series <em>Cover Up</em>, actor Jon-Erik Hexum got bored between takes and played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a> with one blank in his gun. A blank does not have a bullet, but has plastic and paper places in it — the propelling charge is all there. He died from his injury.
</li><li> This was also how Brandon Lee died on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em>. Owing to the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, the prop crew, rather than spend money on "dummy" cartridges for close-up shots of the revolver used to shoot Lee's character, created some on the cheap by taking actual, live .44 Magnum rounds, pulling the bullets out of the cartridges, dumping out the powder, and reinserting the bullets. However, they forgot to take out the percussion primers, which went off with just enough force to lodge a bullet in the gun barrel. When they loaded that same gun with blanks, the force from the shot sent that bullet flying out the barrel and straight into Lee's chest at close to full speed.
</li></ul></li><li> Physicists have noted that <em>any</em> form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster Than Light</a> drive would be as devastating a weapon as it is a useful tool. Even leaving aside the various exotic wedgies you're giving to physics, there's still the fact that, as stated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton">Isaac Newton</a> is the deadliest SOB in space (check out the page quote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange">Arbitrary Maximum Range</a> for why this is so).
<ul><li> Even without FTL, any drive capable of producing sustained acceleration on an object can become this given enough time. Once you've got a drive that can produce relativistic amounts of thrust, you've got the capacity to make a planet-destroying weapon just by sticking that drive on a decent sized chunk of rock and aiming it in the right direction.
</li></ul></li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">less-than-lethal</a> weapons can inflict substantial injuries or even kill if they're misused.
<ul><li> A taser is supposed to provide a debilitating but non-fatal shock. With the right combination of taser and clothing, it's possible to set someone's clothes on fire. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> looked at this one, and found this to be plausible with the right taser and the right clothing.
</li><li> Rubber bullets hurt. While designed to be non-lethal, getting shot with one in the wrong place can lead to serious injury, permanent disfigurement, or even death.
