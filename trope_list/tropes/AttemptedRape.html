Someone is about to be raped, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">at the last minute</a>, the rapist is foiled. Violently. This can happen in one of two ways. If the victim is particularly tough, she (or more rarely he) fights the rapist off themself. Alternatively, they will be rescued by someone else. Depending on who does the rescuing, this can fuel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a> or start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Rescue Romance</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience">Near-Rape Experience</a>, where the would-be rapist stops of their own free will. Distinct from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRapeAverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRapeAverted">Date Rape Averted</a> in that there is no date, and the rapist must, by necessity, be stopped violently — no amount of yelling and slapping is going to work as a deterrent.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> has Hana from Team Spring almost get raped twice. The first time around was by her team's guide Yanagi, to break her down and make her more compliant when he gives orders. A thunderstorm breaks out before anything can really happen. The second time around, Ango tries to rape Hana as a way to, once again, get her to comply to being given orders <em>and</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">revenge for what her father had done to him and his team members when he was their teacher</a>. Before Ango can go through with it, Ayu bursts into the room and interrupts, causing Ango to stop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AestheticaOfARogueHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AestheticaOfARogueHero">Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero</a></em>, Phil tries this on Myuu, adding that he will kill her after he's done. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Akatsuki bursts in and kicks his ass</a>.
</li><li> This is the act that effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">clinches</a> Aoshima as a villain in his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>. Fortunately, even though Belldandy is caught off guard for a variety of reasons, she manages to stop him with her abilities as a goddess — namely, a liberal dose of lightning. The last episode of the season has a similar scene with an aged-up Skuld as the victim, with older sister Urd stepping in to fry him again.
</li><li> In the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>, Tetsuo and his girlfriend Kaori are captured by the Clown gang. They start feeling up Kaori, then they rip off her shirt and knock her unconscious. Before they can do anything, Kaneda and the rest of the gang arrive to save them.
</li><li> It's easier to list the number of times this <em>doesn't</em> happen to Yuri in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>. Rescues come in the form of her getting a hold of a weapon, the rapist having a change of heart, a battle interrupting everything, a convenient fire breaking out, etc.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>, soon after Ryoko is introduced (Kitano saves her). Doubly lampshaded too, when some random thugs wants to check out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster">Ikuno's</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">panties</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland">Alice in Borderland</a></em>, one of the members of the Beach, Suguru Niragi, attempts to rape Usagi when she tries to steal one of the Beach's cards and then he attempts to rape her again when he is seemingly losing with his team in a game known as King of Clubs.
</li><li> Soko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFuuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFuuin">Ao no Fuuin</a></em> experiences this multiple times. In <em>the first Chapter</em> Kashii tries to rape her, but she ultimately stops him by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian">consuming him</a> and leaving only his clothes behind. Shortly after, Akira attempts to do this, but she gets away in time. Even <em>later</em> Akira tries this <em>again</em> when Soko refuses to sleep with him to lose her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">Soryu status</a> because she feels responsible for the rise of the Oni, but she stops him again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">Mikasa</a>'s backstory has her almost sold as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> as a child, by the same men who killed her parents; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">Eren</a> saves her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">rather violently killing one of the men</a>, and when the other was going to kill him, Mikasa picks up the knife and rescues him, starting her journey into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> badassitude.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a> 1932 - Another Junk Railroad</em>, it's heavily implied that the very, very slow progression of Firo and Ennis's relationship is due in part to the fact that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he was younger, Firo was kidnapped and almost sexually assaulted by a pervert who mistook him for a girl</span>. As a result, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's</span> developed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalyzingFearOfSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalyzingFearOfSexuality">Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality</a>.
</li><li> Not a rare occurrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yakushiji Tenzen tries this twice on Oboro and once on Kagerou. Azuki Rousai and Amayo Jingorou both try to rape Okoi.</span> With this many attempts, it kind of makes you wonder, how nobody ever succeeds in finishing the job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Casca has people try to rape her several times. The first attempt is stopped by Griffith, who then has Casca kill the would-be rapist herself. The second attempt is fought off by Casca herself, who kills her attackers, the third when the apostle Wyald tries to do her with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">wacky manhood</a> but she is saved by Guts, and the fourth when the crippled Griffith attempts to force himself on her but fails miserably. She had some pretty close calls. HOWEVER, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when the Eclipse goes down, Casca is ultimately raped right in front of Guts by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the man who saved her from her first sexual assault</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">She doesn't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">come out of it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">very well</a></span>. It doesn't get easier for her afterward, as there are three more attempts, but luckily she was saved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsInDistress">the Child</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when some pagans tried to rape her</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">Guts</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when the Great Goathead tried to make her his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">bride</a>"</span>, and then surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselOutOfDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselOutOfDistress">herself</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when she was almost gang raped by some bandits</span>.
</li><li> Also, Princess Charlotte has to fight off her own half-maddened father's attempt to rape her after her night with Griffith leads to him getting arrested and thrown in the dungeons to be put to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">torture</a>. This alienates her from her father to the point of disowning him and refusing to see him when he's on his deathbed, his health having seriously deteriorated because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">the guilt of what he had done</a>.
</li><li> Then there's that maddened, anthropomorphic possessed horse that tries to rape Farnese, which triggers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackEcho">Flashback Echo</a> in Guts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Casca's rape during the Eclipse</span> and sets off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> <em>big time</em>.
</li><li> Arguably Guts himself almost got this at hands of Slan the female member of The God Hand. As at one point she traps Guts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Qliphoth</a> restraining him, and while molesting Guts she openly intends to have her way with him but fortunately The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Skull Knight</a> intervenes, which annoys Slan.
</li><li> Poor Guts has a phobia/hatred of sexual violence his whole life, and time with Slan he got lucky. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">he was a kid</a> however he wasnt strong enough to defend himself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em>: Hinako Aikawa, the female lead, experiences this midway through the series. She is rescued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkerTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkerTears">male lead Daisuke</a>. It is because of this action does she realize not all men are like said rapist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackGod">Black God</a></em>: When Hiyo finally gets Kuro alone, he corners her and tells her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">how long he had secretly lusted after her</a>, but hadn't been able to act on it since she was always protected by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her palace guards</span>. But he's denied the opportunity <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">again</a></em> when Keita arrives in time to save her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em>:
<ul><li> A high school girl goes to Black Jack for surgery on her throat. After failing to observe the rest period after the surgery, it looks like her only chance to speak again is if she stays quiet for a full year, at which point he'd give her a synthetic vocal box. As she takes this challenge, word gets around that she won't scream or say anything, prompting several guys to take advantage of the situation and try to rape her. She saves herself by throwing her school bag across the road, attracting the attention of several passerbys.
</li><li> Another story has Black Jack operate on a girl who gained a huge amount of weight because of a medical condition. After the surgery, she goes back to her original appearance. At this point, her boyfriend (who dumped her because he didn't want her after she became unattractive and fat) tries to get back together with her. When she turns him down, he tries to rape her. She's saved when Black Jack steps in and throws several syringes and scalpels at him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, this happens several times, most often to Ana including in her introduction, but also to Kakei when he battles Oukatsu, and Isanami gets threatened on one occasion as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CageOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CageOfEden">Cage of Eden</a></em>, it seems that if you're a girl, this trope follows you around like a lost puppy. Kusuru-sensei, Oomori and Rion were almost raped, and the rest of the girls...well, the same couldn't be said for them, notably Oomori's senpai, who was raped TO DEATH.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em>, Shinji tries to rape Sakura, but Rider passes her Caster's dagger Rule Breaker and she stabs him. Instead of killing him, the magic dagger cleanses his heart of evil.
</li><li> A backstory chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Challengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Challengers">Challengers</a></em> reveals that Souichi's homophobia was caused by almost being raped by one of his male professors.

After reading the manga, you'd be forgiven for asking why it's so easy to bump into thugs and rapists in the streets of Japan. Most of these incidents are rather contrived, they're there just to show off how badass our heroes are.

Fortunately, the rapist leader is honorable enough to give Musashi a chance to prove himself after beating him to a pulp, and they all scoot when the leader realizes Musashi is not to be messed with.

Daisuke runs quickly to look for Mizuki, only to find her standing alone at the hospital entrance with her right hand bandaged.

Shigeto's having a good time, although he tries hard to ignore the fact that Haru's way too nonchalant about taking off her shirt in front of him and casually joking about wanting to date him. It's revealed that she's having a difficult time with her boyfriend too, so she's kind of doing all this to piss him off, and she just lies that her cousin is her new "boyfriend" to his face. Haru then just scoots off with Shigeto and go the places where they would play as kids. But after all that fun, Shigeto suddenly starts to get weird, grabs Haru's wrist and says that he wants to be with her. Haru's scared and screams, and her boyfriend who's been following them the whole time jumps out and punches Shigeto. Turns out, this is just a ruse, Shigeto pretended that he wanted to rape his own cousin just so that her boyfriend could come out and save her. He helps them reconcile their relationship, and he's on his way back to mend his own.

To teach her a lesson, he approached her in the showers one night in an attempt to reiterate her proper station with respect to his noble birth. She took exception to his efforts. Her birth on a high-gravity world and extensive studying of martial arts, not to mention her presence on the Saganami Island unarmed combat team, allowed her to violently thwart his efforts to rape her, and were sufficient in insuring his necessary recuperation at the Island's hospital facilities. Honor never did report his actions to the Commandant, as she feared that nobody would believe that the noble son of the wealthy Earl of North Hollow would have been interested in the unattractive daughter of a Sphinx yeoman, and their bitter rivalry would stalk her throughout their years of military service.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop">Betty Boop</a> was a victim of this quite often and one of the most known examples is in the cartoon short <em>Boop-Oop-A-Doop</em>. In this cartoon, Betty is a circus performer who is lusted after by the Ringmaster. At night, the Ringmaster accosts her in her tent and threatens to rape her until Koko the Clown comes in to rescue her. A daring plot for a cartoon made in 1932, a supposedly "purer" time. Only "the Old Man of the mountain" may be more explicit than this.
</li><li> The early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoskoTheTalkInkKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoskoTheTalkInkKid">Bosko's Knight-Mare</a></em> has Honey abducted by the villainous Black Knight. He carries her to his castle and actually gets her down onto the bed before our hero intervenes. (It's even more amazing when you realize that our hero and his girl are African-American and the Black Knight is... er, White.) Maybe it helped that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">all a dream</a></span>.
</li><li> This happens quite occasionally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, and, unlike most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> in general, <strong>none of it is ever played for laughs.</strong> <em><strong>Ever.</strong></em> The most terrifying example, however, happens in the episode, "Meeseeks and Destroy", when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a child molester attacks Morty in a public bathroom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">leaving the poor kid completely traumatized as soon as he (violently) escapes.</a></span> And Rick gets homicidally angry as soon as he puts 2 and 2 together.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode <em>Secrets</em> sneaks this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">under the radar</a>. During Artemis and Zatanna's night out in New York, a female jogger is jumped under a bridge by a trio of unseemly looking guys. Zatanna magically lifts her in the air while Artemis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">beats the crap out of them.</a> When asked if it was a little overboard, Arty replies "they had it coming!"
</li><li> This has happened not once, but <em>twice</em> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>. And they say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">it's a kids' show</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfCalamityJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfCalamityJane">The Legend of Calamity Jane</a></em>, it's discovered in a flashback that this was what led to Jane's first kill; she shot a man trying to rape her as a teen.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spawn">Spawn</a></em> the eponymous hero tries <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and succeeds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a></span> to stop a serial pedophile from making a little girl his latest victim.
</li><li> Nearly every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> cartoon features Bluto/Brutus attempting to rape Olive Oyl towards the end, with the eponymous hero downing a can o' spinach to always save the day in the nick of time. Bluto/Brutus has to be the most prominent serial attempted rapist in popular fiction, making all the times Popeye socks the fat bastard to the moon look like he got off easy.
