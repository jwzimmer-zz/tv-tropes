<ul><li> At the beginning of the Chunin Exams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, the written test has only a 20% penalty for being caught cheating. Why? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Half the material wasn't even actually taught—the real point of the exam was to test the students' ability to gather intel through stealth. Given the outlandish methods of cheating some characters used, it's implied that the proctors allowed anything that would plausibly work for reconnaissance in the field to pass without comment, and only imposed the cheating penalties on <em>incompetent</em> cheaters.</span>
<ul><li> For example: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gaara is secretly creating an eye out of sand to see other people's tests. The examiner, Ibiki, can tell that Gaara is up to something, but is unable to discern the specifics, and therefore lets it slide without marking him down.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>, a pair of twins have been writing graffiti on every surface they can get their brushes on. When their former teacher sees this, he complains that it's awful... because their penmanship is terrible.
<div class="indent"><strong>Teacher:</strong> They should be ashamed, <br/><strong>Woman:</strong> I agree. <br/><strong>Teacher:</strong> Dammit! YOU'RE WRITING IT WRONG!

She has a scene where she angrily objects to thugs beating someone half to death- not because she finds what they are doing wrong, but they need to beat him more so he's literally halfway between life and death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>'s introductory episode for Black Star and Tsubaki has the former try to peek on the latter taking a bath.

He then proceeds to draw several hearts all over it while his male classmates bow to him in respect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, Ymir is less irritated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Krista</span>'s suicidal martyr complex than her dishonesty in not admitting to herself that she has one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unohana</span> isn't insulted by Kenpachi attempting to fight her, but by his halfheartedness in doing so. In her opinion, someone shouldn't fight unless they intend to win- focusing more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">having fun</a> and/or fighting honourably is the mark of a dilettante. (Also, she wants to be treated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">seriously</a>.)
</li><li> In the Soul Society arc, it turns out that Soifon isn't angry at Yoruichi (her patron and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">Protectorate</a>) because the latter followed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Urahara</span> into exile and dishonor. She's angry because Yoruichi didn't give Soifon an opportunity to join her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillerKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillerKiller">Killer Killer</a></em>, Hijirihara is more concerned that the killers he's assigned to catch don't have the passion to back up their crimes than the fact that they're killing at all. In fact, he even grades them on it when he figures out their motivations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>, Taku chides Nomi for using acceleration to cheat on tests, saying that always acing certain tests is obviously suspicious. While Taku is disgusted with himself for abusing the power of acceleration in the past (as well as Nomi by extension, since Nomi reminds Taku of how he used to be), he brought this up as the reason Taku was able to challenge Nomi despite him not being on the match list; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Taku anticipated when Nomi would accelerate and did so at the same time in order to challenge him</a>.

</li><li> In another example, she explains to her teacher at the mosque that she is disobeying her parents (by sneaking out of the house) so that she can help people. Much to her surprise, his response is basically this trope:

When all else failed, they finally decided to blast it open, but used too much dynamite. The resulting explosion blew open the safe, but also shredded the money inside, rendering it completely worthless. The point of this story, as he explained to Rainbird, was that those idiots didn't beat the safe: you haven't beaten the safe unless you get what's inside it in a usable condition. Rainbird draws parallels between this story and what the Shop is trying to do with little Charlene McGee: if, in their efforts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> they attempt too much coercion, he's certain she'll commit suicide and they'll get nothing useful out of her either.

When Shakuni gambles with King Yudhishtira, he cheats and cheats <em>obviously</em>, winning every single throw. This convinces Krishna beyond all doubt that Shakuni was using loaded dice, and makes him far more vengeful than he would have been otherwise. Because of those dice, there can be no doubt that Shakuni's intentions were malevolent- and consequently, no hope of reconciliation between him and the Pandavas.

(This might be considered an inversion of this trope, since the toxicity of mis-made moonshine is a real danger, and thus doing it wrong really <em>is</em> the worst part of what they're up to.)
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> storyline, pregnant vegetarian Phoebe is agonising over her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyCravings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyCravings">Wacky Cravings</a>, and occasionally nibbling on pieces of leftover meat. Joey gives her the advice seen in the quote at the top of this page as he gets out a couple of steaks.

Fran, however, calmly says "Maggie, it's turquoise...".
<ul><li> In another example, Fran discovers that Maggie has a hickey from her boyfriend. She immediately scolds her...for trying to cover it up with foundation. "You need <em>oil-based concealer!</em>"
</li><li> When the family is eating pizza, Fran remarks that since it's a fattening food, she only wants one slice. She proceeds to pick up two pieces and put one on top of the other, claiming that it only counts as one because "the body doesn't know." It's not clear if she's genuinely unaware or simply believes or own lies.

Still, it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge that the sabotage was well planned and perfectly executed.

As the lord of temptation, he explains to Stan the nature of how the whole temptation thing works. He's pretty PO'd when he discovers the Canadian Devil has making Freemium games. After all, temptation has to be over something worthwhile and people making a conscious decision. Freemium games were just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Satan says it lacks nuance though he also shows disdain at the exploitation of mental issues rather than free will.

</li><li> According to a rather shocked French ambassador, the most widespread reaction among the more politically powerful of England's aristocracy in the wake of Earl Essex's failed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I was not so much outrage as contempt for how poorly it was planned. Many of those people said (in private conversation, of course) that had <em>they</em> been doing it, they would've done it much better and would've won.
</li><li> An incompetent group of terrorists ended up doing this in 2007 with separate attacks, each of which ended in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>. The whole thing was planned so badly, no one could really believe that there had been any danger. Plus, successful unrelated terrorist attacks less than a month ago had the country on high alert, making even the timing a terrible decision.
<ul><li> There were two failed car bomb attacks in London, organized by this group. One was parked illegally, and was promptly ticketed and towed away before being routinely inspected (whereupon the bomb was discovered). The other was abandoned suspiciously in front of witnesses. When smoke began to come out of the car, the police were called and the bomb was discovered. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_London_car_bombs">More info on the other wiki.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Hilariously summarized by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZ7M4pWSzw">Adam Hills<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> After the failed terror attack on Glasgow Airport in 2007, many in the national press and entertainment industry lamented how poorly planned and executed it was. The terrorists had planned to ram their car into the Glasgow airport, but not only didn't hurt anyone, they totaled their car on cement poles specifically designed to prevent such a thing, including one terrorist setting himself on fire. Not only did the intended victims not put out the fire, <a class="urllink" href="http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/e9f4c76d738c8309e4b206625f27253e/201087403/burning-terrorist-ball-kick.jpeg">one kicked the burning terrorist in the groin so hard that he tore a tendon in his foot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

</li><li> Robert Erskine Childers, Irish Nationalist, told his <em>firing squad</em> to take a few steps forward so that they didn't miss.
</li><li> Likewise, Cicero told his executioners "There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but at least try to do it properly". Possibly more badass than Cicero because he said that line while <em>holding his neck out</em> for a gladiator to <strong>cut off</strong>, but if the result of a botched job is having said executioner hack at your neck over and over — with you feeling every stroke — this may have just been a wise precaution.

</li><li> In World World II, during the North Africa campaign, the British launched a commando raid on a bunker where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel">Erwin Rommel</a> had previously spent a couple of nights, mistakenly thinking it was Rommel's HQ. After Rommel was peeved that the British would do such a thing - not that they would dare try to raid his HQ, but that they would make the error of thinking a man like him (who preferred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">be right in the thick of battle)</a> would be cowering in a bunker 50 miles away from the front.
</li><li> When the documentary "Major Fraud", about how Major Charles Ingram and his wife cheated their way to a million on the British edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em>, was uploaded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, several of the comments were about how obvious their cheating was, and gave examples of less-detectable ways to do it. Made worse by the fact that Ingram had originally planned to stop at £500,000 but then kept going, making it more obvious.
</li><li> Part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Spartan</a> boys' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> was to send them out with no food or supplies except what they could steal. If they were caught, they were punished not for stealing, but for being poor thieves. The point being to make them develop cunning and smarts along with a good physique.
</li><li> This is rather common among normal people in Italy whenever a terrorist is caught on national soil for the simple reason they apparently always fail and only make the news if what they were planning was particularly heinous or they got caught in a particularly stupid way. Most notably, a cell of the Venetian independentist group the "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Most_Serene_Government">Serenissimi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is mocked due their occupation of Piazza San Marco and the St Mark's Campanile getting them arrested because their sentinel fell asleep <em>and</em>, after they were released, getting arrested again for talking about their new plan, and especially of the homemade tank they were assembling, <em>on the phone</em> (apparently it didn't occur to them that the police would wiretap the phones of a group of convicted terrorists).
</li><li> A British fascist <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-nazi-filmed-spectacularly-failing-to-burn-eu-flag-in-protest-against-forced-immigration-10141197.html">attempted to burn an EU flag in his back garden,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but failed spectacularly.
