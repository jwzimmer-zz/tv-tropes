</p><p>Once in a while a really well written story can feel so real that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis">you begin to wonder if it might not be based on a true story</a>. Occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">this is actually the case</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">supposedly so</a>, but there are times when an author (etc) will go right out of their way to create greater immersion in their work by claiming that their very obviously fictional and fantastic world is in some way real. Usually they claim that they didn't come up with the story, rather it was recounted to them by the actual main characters (or some other witness), often physically, but sometimes by phone or magic. Other times they will claim that they found the account in the form of a diary and novelised it, or, if it is a film, that it comprises <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms">found footage</a> or a mixture of found footage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramatisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramatisation">Dramatisation</a>.

In this version the author pretends they are simply publishing something that someone else has written - this often takes the form of a novelization of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWesternMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWesternMysteries">diary or a set of notebooks</a>. Other methods include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">accounts by secondary characters</a> and so on. This trope, a staple of children's books and fantastic tales, often features an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> or even instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBeyondTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBeyondTheFourthWall">From Beyond the Fourth Wall</a> or other strangeness and may be said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">translated from accounts of what happened or books written by the characters</a> and never actually communicated in person.

</p><p><strong>Absolutely <em>not</em> to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis">Literary Agent Hypothesis</a></strong>, when fans think that maybe the story is actually real, or like to think it is, but don't have any support from canon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.

</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This trope only applies to <em>canon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> examples</em> in fictional works. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> examples go in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATrueStoryInMyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATrueStoryInMyUniverse">A True Story in My Universe</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a></em>, depending on the adaptation:
<ul><li> In the original gamebook adaptation, it's heavily implied the whole saga is told from the point of view of Hans, who in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> is the collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> for Hobby Japan, the creators of the franchise.
</li><li> In the animated adaptation, the Head Archangel, who is Nanael and Hachiel's boss, took his place instead.
</li><li> In <em>Queen's Blade Grimoire</em>, the newest continuity of the franchise, the whole plot is told from the POV of a grandmother who tells the story to her granddaughter. This is justified in-universe, since the whole continuity is based on many classic fairy tales, and the whole story is told like one.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Jack Chick</a> swore up and down that his stories were true, but whether he meant that so as to ensure his message would be taken to heart will never be answered.
</li><li> It's long been tradition at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> that they weren't making stories up, just reporting what really happened. (To the point that they once showed a writer and artist very concerned they hadn't heard from their characters they "covered", and were debating what to do for the next issue. They reacted with absolute horror at the suggestion they just "make something up".) However, this was directly averted in a letter column after the Death of Phoenix in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, when the editor wrote about the many touching letters they received about how much the story meant to some of the fans. Some people even sent flowers. And then, they started getting <em>death threats</em> over the story. To which the editor said, "I know we joke we're just reporting what really happened, but it's just a comic book. It is brightly colored ink on cheap paper that will decay to dust in two hundred years. It is not worth threatening anyone's life."
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> once related a story about how, at a convention, he was sitting at an autograph table and a boy and his mother walked by. "That's Peter David! He works in the comics", the kid says. His mother turns to David and asks, "You draw the comics?" "Actually, I'm a writer." She looks confused. "So what do you do in comics?", she asks. Before David can respond, the boy pipes up: "Oh, he writes down everything Spider-Man says and puts it in the comics." <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0n3ky');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0n3ky" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0n3ky');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> which is <em>still</em> an accurate description of what he does, aside from the fact he also <em>decides</em> what Spider-Man is going to say.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This concept was firmly woven into the foundation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>-laden pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. At least one hero took his name from a "fictional" predecessor who (as it turned out) lived in a parallel universe, and there was a world known as "Earth-Prime" which was an almost-exact replica of the "real" world (until just before the Crisis, when it got its own version of Superboy).
<ul><li> In fact, writer Gardner Fox wrote stories in which the superheroes from other Earths would narrate their adventures to him and editor Julius Schwartz and sometimes ask for their help.
</li><li> Fox fan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> paid a somewhat darker homage to these stories when he wrote himself into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a></em>.
</li><li> Following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em>, Earth-Prime was brought back as part of the multiverse as Earth-33. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMultiversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMultiversity">The Multiversity</a> Guidebook</em> (written by Grant Morrison) notes, in its Earth-33 write-up, that "Monitor conjecture suggests that ideas created by ordinary human minds on Earth-Prime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">become realities</a> on other worlds of the Multiversal Orrery structure." Or, to put it another way, when the writers imagine new worlds in the DC multiverse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">those worlds become real</a>.
</li><li> The role-playing game supplement for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> explains the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a> technology of early Legion stories by explaining that of <em>course</em> the early Legion had Omnicoms and flight-rings, they just couldn't show them in 1960s comics because they were so far beyond the readers' tech-level.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> claims to have met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine">John Constantine</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em> fame in real life, more than once.

(In real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, Ransom was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow">based on</a> Lewis's good friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>.) <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em> even ends with a chapter explaining how the Lewis came to learn of the story from Ransom, and why they decided to publish the story in the guise of fiction: to avoid reprisals from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> counterparts of the villains, and because the events were simply too outrageous to be believed if they were published as nonfiction. This is then followed by a letter from Ransom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">pointing out all the details of the adventure that Lewis got wrong</a> or were simply too esoteric to convey in writing. The next novel, <em>Perelandra</em> continues with the Agent Hypothesis in the text, but includes a preface stating that all the human characters are fictitious and non-allegorical. The final novel, <em>That Hideous Strength</em>, drops all pretense, and in fact events in the book flatly contradict actual then-current political history.

Lewis himself gives it only the briefest (and funniest) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waves</a>, asking the reader not to delve too deeply into how he acquired them.

The friend attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defy</a> it, saying he'd rather assume readers believe the theories were Machen's own rather than his.

<ul><li> The core of the story (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>) exist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> as Bilbo's diary and Frodo's account of his adventures, and is called the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument">Red Book of Westmarch</a></em>. This original <em>Red Book</em> was copied into an edition called <em>The Thain's Book</em>, to which someone added a few volumes of "Translations from the Elvish" by Bilbo. This was copied in turn by one "Findegil, the King's Writer" — the date this copy was made is the last dated event in the book, so we can presume Tolkien "discovered and translated" this copy. <br/>The story begins with Bilbo's homely descriptions of the hobbit characters' interaction, gradually changes to Frodo's scholarly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">slightly purple narration</a> throughout most of the rest of the book, and ending with Sam's down-to-earth, humble (but still educated) language towards the end — the second half of Book Six, detailing the Scouring and renewal of the Shire, is directly implied to have been written by Sam ("I <em>have</em> finished. The last few pages are for you").
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostTales">The Book of Lost Tales</a></em>, the earliest version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, the stories are told via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> of elves telling them to an Anglo-Saxon mariner, Ælfwine, who stumbled upon the Elvish island Tol Eressëa, who then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNarrator">writes them down</a> and takes them back to England. His book is found long afterwards in the ruins of an old house and ends up with Tolkien who, being a Professor of Old English, translates it. The two contradict each other because the "Anglo-Saxon mariner" framing story gives us one version of events (<em>The Book of Lost Tales</em>), while Bilbo is the editor/author of <em>Translations from the Elvish</em> (aka <em>The Silmarillion</em>), a different account of the same myths.

"Lemony Snicket" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName">pseudonym</a> for Daniel Handler; Handler is frequently referenced as Snicket's agent but is also a background character who exists in-universe (such as the cigarette-smoking man who appears briefly in <em>The Penultimate Peril</em>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>:
<ul><li> Burroughs presents himself as the great-nephew and literary executor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">John Carter of Mars</a> in the <em>Barsoom</em> novels. At the beginning of each book it tells how Carter visited Burroughs and gave him <em>this</em> story (and then disappeared again). In <em>The Master Mind of Mars</em>, we are told that Ulysses Paxton has read the earlier works and so recognizes Barsoom when he reaches it.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter">film</a> makes it more blatant by having Burroughs rush to his uncle's tomb and, upon opening it, discover it empty. A Thern appears behind him about to kill Burroughs and Carter only to be shot by Carter who shows up behind the Thern. Carter tells Burroughs to write a book, locks himself in the tomb and once again projects to Barsoom using the Thern's talisman.
</li></ul></li><li> Burroughs's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan">Tarzan</a> novel, similarly, begins with an explicit statement that Burroughs was told the story by one who was there, and that the names have been changed to protect the etc. When the Tarzan series took off, this aspect of the story proved impossible to keep up, and was quietly dropped; however, fans still make use of it when discussing what Tarzan's life was "really" like. This was paid homage to in the series based on the Disney animated adaptation, where he writes the book after meeting Tarzan.
</li><li> Burroughs did the same thing for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Amtor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Amtor">Amtor</a></em> novels, where he is visited psychically by the protagonist, Carson Napier of Venus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum">(who oddly enough, rarely uses his psychic powers for anything other than giving Burroughs infodumps)</a>.
</li><li> Burroughs did this yet again for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pellucidar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pellucidar">Pellucidar</a></em> novels. In the first one he meets David Innes, the hero during a safari in the Sahara desert, after Innes has come up from Pellucidar. In the second one he receives a telegraph message from a line Innes laid all the way the the Earth's core. In all the others (and in some of the <em>Barsoom</em> novels) his next door neighbor is an inventor who develops a neutrino radio that can send signals through solid rock to communicate with Pellucidar.
</li><li> Even his novels set in the future do this: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonMaid">The Moon Maid</a></em> (1923) opens with an introduction in which Burroughs is told the events of the distant future by a man who can remember the lives of his future reincarnations ... although for some reason this is dated to the near future of 1967, rather than the present.
</li></ul></li><li> Some later publications of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> add a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EoinColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EoinColfer">this man</a> is not my biographer" preword from Artemis... despite the epilogue already presenting the book as an LEP psych report.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, it's heavily alluded to that Bram Stoker wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> on a commission from rival supernatural factions to educate people on the nature and weaknesses of Black Court vampires. The result is that the Black Court is nearly extinct in the present day. And, in one of the recent "extra" stories, it's pointed out that the <em>Necronomicon</em> was actually a Grimoire of great power — until the White Council found it and published it all over the place, and by making it available to every minor mage and wannabe in existence, effectively nullified the power by spreading the effect over the entire world.
<ul><li> In an interview with the author, a fan asked whether H. P. Lovecraft was onto something in the same way. The answer - yes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>.
</li><li> The rulebooks for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">the tabletop RPG</a> are presented as Billy's attempt to recreate Stoker's success by publishing an all-purpose guide to the supernatural in the <em>guise</em> of a tabletop role-playing game. It's an early draft, so it also has commentary from Harry and Bob scribbled in the margins (much of it telling him to cut top-secret information that Harry doesn't want getting out).
</li><li> The books themselves are implied to be Harry narrating his case files to, well, the reader. The RPG book lampshades this by pointing out that Harry names all his major cases with two word titles that have the same character length (<em>Storm Front, Fool Moon, Grave Peril,</em> etc).
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> series, the novels are written down by Clio, the Muse of History; apparently someone's been leaking them to Mundania. One Author's Note actually includes a character doing her service to the Good Magician by going through the pun credits.
</li><li> N.E. Bode claims throughout "the nobodies" and "the somebodies" that Fern Bone, the main character, sat down next to him/her on the subway and told her story (the Anybodies) to the then out of luck writer.
</li><li> While the books themselves do not invoke Direct Line to the Author, Garth Nix <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scholastic.com/titles/seventhtower/qa.htm">has said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower">The Seventh Tower</a></em>, "Often, I get the feeling that the story is really happening somewhere and all I'm doing is trying to work out the best way to tell it."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a> styled himself the "Royal Historian of Oz", all the stories came from Dorothy telling them to him (eventually through a magic wireless after Dorothy moved to Oz permanently). He also made an attempt to use this trope to <em>end</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Oz series</a> at one point, claiming a spell of Glinda's to detach Oz completely from the outside world meant he was no longer in contact with Dorothy. It didn't stick any better than sending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> over Reichenbach Falls, of course.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSagaOfDarrenShan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSagaOfDarrenShan">The Saga of Darren Shan</a></em>: it is canon in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarrenShan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarrenShan">Darren Shan</a>'s books that he assembled his stories from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">diaries sent to him by his younger alternate self in an aborted timeline where</span> he became a vampire. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext">makes more sense in context</a>... kinda. Essentially, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darren altered the timeline so the events of the series didn't happen, thus resetting himself to how he was at the beginning of the first book. Somehow his diaries chronicling the series survived and were sent to the new Darren, who is an author...</span> Thus the books actually happened. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In another timestream</span>.
</li><li> The 10th-century <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTaleOfGenji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTaleOfGenji">The Tale of Genji</a></em> includes a number of references indicating that the narrator is relating a true story and that she is merely describing this story to others. For example, at the end of chapter 4:
<div class="indent"><em>I had passed over Genji's trials and tribulations in silence, out of respect for his determined efforts to conceal them, and I have written of them now only because certain lords and ladies criticized my story for resembling fiction, wishing to know why even those who knew Genji best should have thought him perfect, just because he was an Emperor's son. No doubt I must now beg everyone's indulgence for my effrontery in painting so wicked a portrait of him</em>.
</div><ul><li> She also uses that conceit, from time to time, to poke fun at literary clichés of her time, by saying things to the effect of "If this were a common story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">I would describe such-and-such</a>" or "If the old stories were to believed, she should've acted in such-and-such a way".
</li></ul></li><li> Practically all novels at the beginning of the genre (roughly the 18th Century) used this device, claiming to be either memoirs/autobiographies or caches of letters, i.e. epistolary novels. It was not until Henry Fielding that the third-person omniscient narrator was introduced. Examples:
<ul><li> Everything by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDefoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDefoe">Daniel Defoe</a>,
</li><li> Samuel Richardson's <em>Pamela</em> and <em>Clarissa</em>,
</li><li> Jonathan Swift's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em>
</li><li> Lawrence Sterne's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TristramShandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TristramShandy">Tristram Shandy</a></em> — which is also the longest sustained attempt at subverting the trope.
</li><li> <em>Die Insel Felsenburg</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robinsonade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robinsonade">Robinsonade</a> by Johann Gottfried Schnabel.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>:
<ul><li> The mystery novel <em>Murder at the ABA</em> takes the form of Asimov's dramatization of events as related to him by fictional character Darius Just (who bears a noticeable resemblance to real-world author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a>). Asimov includes himself as a minor character in the story, and the book includes occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever">footnote comments</a> by Just and responses by Asimov.
</li><li> Asimov also uses the device in the short story "Pâté de Foie Gras". The titular goose literally lays gold-filled eggs, and a group of government experts is trying to figure out where the gold is coming from (or at least figure out how to breed additional gold-egg-laying geese so that some can be spared for dissection). The story ends with one of the experts convincing the others to get the account published in an SF magazine as fiction, thus putting it before a large number of people who might come up with useful ideas while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraGambit">still maintaining plausible deniability</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Steven Brust's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> novels occasionally place Brust as the translator of the stories from Dragaeran into English. He even has an interview with Paarfi, the "original author" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KhaavrenRomances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KhaavrenRomances">Khaavren Romances</a>, who is outraged by the changes that Brust admits he had to make. In one of the Vlad Taltos novels, Vlad mentions in one story that he's narrating his stories into a cylinder in return for gold. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tiassa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tiassa">Tiassa</a></em> clarifies that a man from "very far East" (presumably Brust) met Vlad through Sethra Lavode, who met him through the Necromancer, and offered 500 Imperials of unminted gold for a few hours of conversation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>: Cervantes parodies the trope. It was used by a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">(today forgotten)</a> authors of chivalry books who claimed that their story was based in an old manuscript found in an ancient pyramid or another ruined building in some faraway country, written in an exotic language by a wise, famed wizard who favoured the hero of the novel. Those claims are made to feign that the chivalry book was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy">Inspired by...</a> real events. Cervantes twists this and uses it to comic effect, explaining that the next part of the novel was found in some pamphlets and papers (only a few years old) found in Alcana de Toledo (a real city in Spain) in a silk mercer store, written in Arabic (a fair known language in Spain) by a (foolish) boy who didn't know what was written and so sold the papers to Cervantes for peanuts. If we include the funny name of the wizard and the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">second author, the translator and Cide Hamete Benengeli are always making comments about the book</a>, we can see that Cervantes wants us to admit that all this tale is a long sequence of lies and nonsense... just like all the chivalry books.
</li><li> Chaucer combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em>, which is presented as Chaucer's transcription of all the tales the other people on his pilgrimage are telling, and he throws in a couple of his own.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpiderRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpiderRobinson">Spider Robinson</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CallahansCrosstimeSaloon">Callahan's Crosstime Saloon</a></em> series, Spider claims to be transcribing stories told to him by the narrator, Jake Stonebender. He even goes as far as writing Author's Notes and Prefaces "in character" as a Callahan's regular.
</li><li> This sort of thing is pretty much a law when it comes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> pastiches, given the fandom's emphasis on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteraryAgentHypothesis">Literary Agent Hypothesis</a>. Traditionally, all pastiches must begin with an introduction explaining how this "lost manuscript of Dr. Watson" was discovered in an old trunk or attic and can now finally be released to the public. (The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories had references to Watson publishing accounts of his adventures, but never went so far as to claim that he was doing so through Arthur Conan Doyle; they always implied, if not actually stated, that in-universe Watson's accounts were published under his own name.)
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryRussell">Mary Russell</a></em> books by Laurie R. King, in which Sherlock Holmes is a major character, contain numerous prefaces and afterwords detailing the mysterious means by which King received the manuscripts which she's been editing into the books; the narratives themselves also have occasional references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> as Watson's agent, including Holmes's chagrin when Conan Doyle goes public with a belief in fairies.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Sherlock Holmes at the 1902 Fifth Test</em> by Stanley Shaw. It begins with a foreword in which Shaw claims to have found the manuscript in the attic in his grandfather's handwriting, proceeds with his grandfather's account of how he helped Sherlock Holmes foil an attempt to sabotage the final match of the 1902 Ashes cricket series, and ends with an afterword in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shaw notes that the account couldn't possibly be accurate, because his grandfather had a leg amputated before 1902, so he's not claiming it's a true story, just that it's very old previously-undiscovered fanfic</span>.
</li><li> An interesting example at the start of James Lovegrove's <em>Cthulhu Casebooks</em> series of mashup novels. The introduction to the first volume, <em>Shadows in Shadwell</em>, carefully explains how Lovegrove got these manuscripts from the estate of one Henry Prothero Lovecraft (a distant relative of both the <em>other</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> and Lovegrove himself) and that analysis suggests they are genuine. Nonetheless, since they're supposedly Watson claiming that nearly everything he wrote was a deception designed to conceal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">Things Man Was Not Meant to Know</a>, the introduction is unconvinced they aren't some kind of bizarre hoax. Lovegrove's straighter Holmes pastiches are referenced, suggesting in-universe Lovegrove is loath to believe the other Watson manuscripts he edited were a pack of lies (not to mention not wanting to believe he's in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a>). By the introductions to the second and third books, he's become less sceptical (and the epilogue to the third book reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in-univese Lovegrove has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneMadFromTheRevelation">Gone Mad From The Revelation</a></span>).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexandreDumas">Alexandre Dumas</a> claimed to have found and elaborated upon records of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></em>.
</li><li> George MacDonald Fraser's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a> series blurs a number of lines. The title character is lifted from a Victorian novel (along with at least two supporting characters), and occasional supporting characters are lifted from other works of fiction (notably Colonel Sebastian Jack Moran and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> himself), but most characters are from actual recorded history (minor characters are often invented by Fraser). Despite Flashman's life story being preposterous, it weaves fairly seamlessly into the myriad real events he becomes involved with, lending credence to Fraser's claim to be the agent for one Paget Morrison, who inherited Flashman's memoirs. Among copious footnotes by the "editor", a few point out that Flashman's memory must be mistaken, as it's known from other sources that (e.g.) X died before Y reached India.... The conceit worked well enough that (according to a 1969 article in Time magazine), at least 10 American reviewers of the first novel thought it was an actual autobiography.
</li><li> The <em>Chronicles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gor">Gor</a></em> started this way, with the first three books told in the first person of the main character, Tarl Cabot. Various notes are included explaining that the "author", John Norman, never met Cabot in person, but the two had a mutual acquaintence who kept finding new untitled manuscripts mysteriously left in his New York apartment, and passed them on to Norman to be published.
</li><li> There is a... let's call it <em>elaborate</em>... prologue to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></em> in which Nathaniel Hawthorne explains that he did not write the story of Hester Prynne; he only found it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterMoers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterMoers">Walter Moers</a> uses this for most of his <em>Zamonia</em> novels. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenAndAHalfLivesOfCaptainBluebear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenAndAHalfLivesOfCaptainBluebear">The 13 ½ Lives of Captain Bluebear</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCityOfDreamingBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCityOfDreamingBooks">The City of Dreaming Books</a></em> are supposedly translations of autobiographies of the narrators. The setup of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlchemastersApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlchemastersApprentice">The Alchemaster's Apprentice</a></em> is a bit more complicated: Walter Moers supposedly translated a book written by Hildegunst von Mythenmetz, which is a retelling of a story by Gofid Letterkerl. Actually it's a retelling of <em>Spiegel, das Kätzchen</em> by Gottfried Keller. (Mythenmetz and Letterkerl are fictional authors, Moers and Keller are/were real people; Letterkerl's name is, in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">an anagram</a> of Keller's.)
</li><li> The introduction to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em> frames it as a letter from a sea captain to his sister after he briefly picked up the title character (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">and no, that's not the monster</a>) in the Arctic and copied his story down. Making this even more complicated is the fact that Frankenstein quotes <em>the monster</em> for several chapters, and the monster also tells a story within a story within a story about the family he first sheltered with.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>:
<ul><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> series, the heroes arrive in 1977 Maine, meet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>, and instruct him to write and publish an account of their exploits. In this case, the trope is also used to explain why Eddie Dean grew up in Queens when his home, in Co-Op City, is located in the Bronx; on his Earth, Co-Op City is located in Queens, but it's located in the Bronx in "the real world" and so King was accurately describing the lay of the land in the quasi-fictional New York from which Dean hails. (Eddie initially loses his temper; he believes he grew up in the wrong borough because King made a mistake.)
</li><li> More than that, King attempts to use the <em>Dark Tower</em> series to tie together <em>all</em> his books under the "existing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">Multiverse</a> channeled by Author's imagination" theory, giving a whole new meaning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>. We also know this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding">Canon Welding</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> also does this with some of the more recent books written under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman. In the forewords to those, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> claims that the books were unfinished manuscripts by the late Bachman that he had been asked to polish and update for release after Bachman died of "cancer of the pseudonym". (Making him a Literary Agent for himself, oddly enough.)
</li></ul></li><li> Author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a> has done this with several of his books:
<ul><li> In the original book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>, one of the many differences from the film adaptation was the death of Ian Malcolm. In the sequel novel, Malcolm explains that his death was just a rumour, leading the reader to believe that the original novel was merely an imperfect retelling of the actual events. (The original novel was also prefaced by "The InGen Incident", a historical-nonfiction-style bit about the problems the book's events caused.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAndromedaStrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAndromedaStrain">The Andromeda Strain</a></em> is presented as a docudrama-style recounting of actual events, complete with a bibliography listing relevant scientific papers (most of the citations are real, but some are fakes supposedly authored by characters from the book).
</li><li> Crichton also did it with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EatersOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EatersOfTheDead">The 13th Warrior</a></em>. Aside from the footnotes scattered through the book (again a mix of real and fake information), the beginning is an <em>actual historical document</em>, written by the real Ahmad ibn Fadlan, up to the point where he heads off with the Vikings to battle the Wendol. The novel is portrayed as a translation of ibn Fadlan's writing that extended past the point where the real ibn Fadlan stopped (even having the end of the novel terminate just as another adventure seemed to start, indicating there was more yet to happen but the manuscript had been lost). Crichton commented at one point, a few years after writing it, that he had forgotten where the fictional part of the novel actually started.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RisingSun">Rising Sun</a></em> is apparently the narrator, a detective, telling a story in an LAPD interview room.
</li></ul></li><li> Denise Mina's novel <em>Sanctuary</em> (released as <em>Deception</em> in the US) is a crime novel told in diary format. The book features an introduction from Mina in which she claims she found the diary on a second-hand PC and subsequently won a court ruling that allowed her to publish the diary — much to the original author's objections — under her own name. An afterword further muddies the water by suggesting that some of the events described in the book did not happen in "real life", being exaggerations on the part of the original author.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> is introduced as a story edited down from a "famous" piece of literature written by S. Morgenstern, a fictional resident of the fictional country of Florin. The real author, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman">William Goldman</a>, claims that this is the Good Parts Version his father (an immigrant from Florin) read to him as a child. There are frequent "editor's notes" which summarize the excised text (these summaries can run for pages being nothing but lists of how many pages were spent on the various mundanities of, say, Buttercup packing so she could move (three whole pages on her blouses, was the guy nuts?), or the things Buttercup was taught so she could be a royal, in order to impress upon us how very grateful we are to Mr. Goldman for editing the book). At one point Goldman claims he wrote an additional scene which the publisher refused to include and gives an address one may write to in order to obtain it. Letters sent to that address are responded to with an explanation that someone acting on the original author's behalf is still blocking publication of the additional scene. Later editions blurred the line further, with an afterword of Goldman recounting a meeting he had with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> while he was writing the (real) screenplay for <em>Misery</em>. He portrays King as a big fan of the original book who was outraged at some of the changes Goldman made. King is also alleged to be doing the abridgment of the long lost sequel <em>Buttercup's Baby</em>. One of the later editions goes even further, revealing that the deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> fell through, so Goldman is doing <em>Buttercup's Baby</em>... and he includes the first bits of it, resolving the cliffhanger ending of the original book.
</li><li> Umberto Eco engages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose">The Name of the Rose</a></em>, initially claiming that the work is an adaptation of a translation of an account by the novel's protagonist, ostensibly written well after the events occurred, but then proceeding to criticize the accuracy of the account, both directly in the foreword and implicitly in the epilogue. He does the same in <em>The Prague Cemetery</em>.
</li><li> Mark Z. Danielewski's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfLeaves">House of Leaves</a></em> is entirely based around the idea that the reader is reading a manuscript found by the editor — who tells his own story in footnotes, including events that reference the effect of the book on the real world and an encounter with the author's sister's band, Poe, who released an album "Haunted" from the point of view of one of the characters of the story. There are further layers to this metaphysical tale, and it includes and subverts any number of science fiction, horror and fiction tropes. There's also the author of the manuscript's claim that not only is <em>The Navidson Record</em> real, despite the editor's insistence that no such documentary exists, but also that the characters are real people and that Karen was the one who arranged for the tapes to be compiled. And then, in the last appendix of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there are pictures that imply that Zampano might be right and <em>The Navidson Record</em> might actually be real</span>.
</li><li> James Howe's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bunnicula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bunnicula">Bunnicula</a></em> series claims in the prologues that Howe is simply the literary agent for a <em>dog</em>, the Dr. Watson to a cat who fancies himself a paranormal investigator <em>par excellence</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em> by Robert Graves. The entire premise of the story is that the Roman Emperor Claudius wrote a memoir giving all the inside dirt on the Imperial Family and that Mr. Graves actually did discover these secret papers, "Nineteen hundred years or near" later.
</li><li> Elizabeth Peters' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmeliaPeabody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmeliaPeabody">Amelia Peabody</a></em> novels are framed as being excerpts from the rather extensive and detailed journals Mrs. Emerson kept over many decades, starting approximately with her initial trip to Egypt in the 1880s, during which she met the man who would become her husband. Later volumes also include excerpts from "Manuscript H", written by Amelia's son Ramses. Elizabeth Peters takes on the role of the editor of these journals in the author's notes, which allows some extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>: she often expresses exasperation at the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the text, such as the signs that the journals were rewritten many years later with an eye towards publication ("Little did I know..."), and Amelia's tendency to put her own opinions in the mouths of her famous contemporaries.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinotopia">Dinotopia</a></em> books are prefaced with James Gurney's claim that they are merely reproductions of real journals that he's found, rather than being fiction. The second book has Arthur Denison's journal - implied to be the same as the previous book - being lost at sea and the story continues from this point regardless, but this book is a stylistic change, lacking a note from Gurney and being in third person. <em>Journey to Chandra</em> returns to this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>: The opening chapter of every book invokes this trope, and every now and then it also comes into the body of the story as well. There are a number of issues with the implementation, such as characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">narrating right up to their deaths</span>, and the fact that even though they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">refuse to give their real name or hometown</a> in case their enemies read the books, they still give away plenty of other information their enemies would find useful — which this is not the place to discuss in detail. The use of the second person in opening narration is primarily just a way to put the reader in the fearful background.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfPellinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfPellinor">Books of Pellinor</a></em> are supposedly translations of a saga from the land of Edil-Amarandh.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a>'s <em>The Time Ships</em>, a sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a>'s <em>The Time Machine</em>, is supposedly based on a journal that mysteriously turned up in an old bookstore. The book also implies that the Time Traveller told his story to H. G. Wells who then created a fictionalised version.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouOnlyLiveTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouOnlyLiveTwice">You Only Live Twice</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bond is believed dead</span>, his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">obituary</span> mentions that there is a book series being written about his adventures. It also mentions that if the books were any closer to the truth, they'd prosecute the author, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming">an old friend of Bond's</a>, under the Official Secrets Act. And in the book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpyWhoLovedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpyWhoLovedMe">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></em>, the author says the main female gave her account of the events to him. John Pearson's "authorised biography" of Bond runs with the idea, explaining that the Bond novels were a disinformation campaign intended to keep the opposition guessing about whether Bond really existed (In a bit of ironic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>, it asserts that <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> is the one novel that's completely made up). Of course, Commander Fleming really was up to his neck in skullduggery of all sorts and it is possible that he did include one or two interesting snippets from his own adventures....
</li><li> John DeChancie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CastlePerilous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CastlePerilous">Castle Perilous</a></em> books are purported to be true adventures (except <em>Castle Dreams</em>) written down by Osmirik, Court Scribe and Royal Librarian to Lord Incarnadine, and are so 'introduced' by him at the beginning of each entry into the series (after they've been smuggled through the portal, or Aspect, to our world). Later it is revealed that Lord Incarnadine himself takes on the identity of a writer here on Earth, passing off Osmirik's accounts as his own fantasy works (presumably under the pseudonym of DeChancie himself!). This self-mockery reaches its height in <em>Castle Dreams</em> when 'Osmirik' claims never to have seen the earlier novels, let alone written them or their prefaces, and engages in a long and lively debate about alternate realities, how the magic of the castle could have spontaneously produced such works, and the literary merit (or lack thereof) of such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatMe">"cheap trash" with "terrible cover art."</a> It even enters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> territory when he not only denounces the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever">footnotes</a> which appear throughout the book, but claims <em>in a second preface</em> that the first one appeared in the book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">before he had even written it</a>.
</li><li> The novels in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>'s <em>Nomad of the Time Streams</em> sequence are presented in this fashion; all three are presented as being accounts / letters written by the protagonist, Oswald Bastable, to Moorcock's grandfather (also named Michael Moorcock); the first two were delivered personally to Moorcock's grandfather, but the last was delivered to Moorcock himself, as his grandfather had passed away by the time the time-and-reality-swapping messenger managed to deliver it to him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Thursday Next</a></em> takes this to its logical extreme: every single book ever written is based on events in the alternate universe Bookworld, with the ideas telepathically sent to the minds of the author.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a></em> and the companion Field Guide are claimed by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi to be actual events, with the Graces having written to them and told their story. The Field Guide itself was apparently sent to them as well, with DiTerlizzi taking on the task of restoring Arthur Spiderwick's creature paintings within. The sequel trilogy, <em>Beyond The Spiderwick Chronicles</em> goes further with the protagonists having actually read the books and Field Guide, meeting up with the authors at a book signing for help in dealing with a problem with Giants as well as actually meeting Jared, who explains that their last names were changed in the books for privacy's sake.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard">The Tales of Beedle the Bard</a></em> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series has this. It's kind of weird to see Rowling write footnotes to Dumbledore's commentary of Beedle's tales, which were translated by Hermione. The foreword by Rowling references <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">The Deathly Hallows</a></em> from the "seventh book of the biography of Harry Potter".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 2017 edition, released the year after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">the film of the same title</a>, includes a foreword by Newt Scamander implying the film is a recently-declassified account of actual events, and he mentions "As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts">more documents</a> become declassified over the coming years, I will be freer to speak openly about my role during that dark period of our history."
</li><li> The "School Books" had a twist on this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges">Quidditch Through the Ages</a></em> assert that the wizarding world is real, and these books are magically copied (with a foreword added by Dumbledore) from real books from Hogwarts. Complete with graffiti written in the margins by Harry and his friends, no less.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Pushcart War</em> did this, except that at the time of publication the dates given in the book were in the <em>future</em>. At least one reader read the book as a kid and didn't realize it was fiction because by that time the dates in her copy were fifteen or twenty years in the past.
</li><li> The classic but criminally under appreciated Sword &amp; Planet novel <em>Transit to Scorpio</em> was written by Kenneth Bulmer, but published under the name Alan Burt Akers. Within the books, "Akers" presents himself as the literary agent of English naval officer Dray Prescott, who is lost on the distant world of Antarres. Aker receives manuscripts regularly from Prescott, who gets booted back to Earth by the "Star Lords" whenever they get bored with jerking him around. The series expanded to 45 books (54 if you count the titles only published in German) making up 11 "cycles", and by the third or fourth book the by-line on the covers actually read "As Told to Alan Burt Akers by Dray Prescott." Kenneth Bulmer's name never appears on any of the books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeOfPi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeOfPi">Life of Pi</a></em> by Yann Martel is supposedly a novelization of true events; the prologue features Martel himself in India, meeting the character Mamaji who, in turn, tells him about the main character, Pi. The first section of the novel is the story of Pi's childhood, interlaced with scenes of Martel supposedly meeting and interviewing Pi as an adult. (The rest is about a shipwreck, a tiger and some Japanese guys.)
</li><li> The <em>Virgil Tibbs</em> series by John Ball (which began with <em>In the Heat of the Night</em>) has a protagonist with a Direct Line to the Author. In <em>The Great Detectives</em>, edited by Otto Penzler, various creators of detective series contributed short articles on their creations (e.g. Chester Gould on Dick Tracy, Walter Gibson on the Shadow, etc.); John Ball used this trope for his article on Virgil Tibbs. He writes:
<div class="indent">Ms. Diane Stone, secretary to Chief Robert McGowan of the Pasadena Police Department, was on the phone. "The chief has approved the release to you of the details concerning the Morales murder," she told me. He has authorized you to go ahead with it at any time, if you want to." Of course I wanted to: the unraveling of the case via the patient, intelligent investigation work of the department in general, and Virgil Tibbs in particular, would need no embellishment in the telling. As I always do in such instances, I called Virgil and suggested a meeting. Two nights later we sat down to dine together in one of Pasadena's very fine restaurants.... By the time that the main course had been put down in front of us we had gone over the Morales case in detail and Virgil had filled me in on several points which had not previously been made public. As always, I agreed to publish nothing until the department had read the manuscript and had given it an official approval. This procedure helped to eliminate possible errors and also made sure that I had not unintentionally included information which was still confidential.
</div></li><li> Robert Littell used this trope for <em>The Amateur</em>, published in 1980. He notes in a prologue that Charlie Heller (the main protagonist of the novel) met with him to have the novel published. Littell notes that Heller had learned of Littell's "fictionalization" of the events depicted in <em>The Defection of A.J. Lewinter</em> and <em>The Debriefing</em>. Internal details suggest that the events of <em>The Amateur</em> took place in 1972 (i.e. a terrorist victim's gravestone reads 1972).
</li><li> Some of the Nick Carter stories of the late 19th century and early 20th century used this idea. In the story 'Nick Carter and the Professor', the narrator states "and it may be explained that the operations of the four, as described in the first chapter of this account, were learned from the confession of one of them, who turned State's evidence". In the story 'Nick Carter's Mysterious Case' a footnote appears, after an asterisk in the main body of the page, reading "The detective [Nick Carter] has told me that he [a man Carter offered a reward] never came. What his was, is a mystery. AUTHOR". Another story has a note "The following story was told to the writer by Nick Carter" and "I tell the story in my own way and in the third person, but the facts, scenes and incidents are reproduced as nearly as possible in the great detective's own words. THE AUTHOR".
</li><li> Willard Wright wrote the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhiloVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PhiloVance">Philo Vance</a> novels under the pen name S.S. Van Dine. S.S. Van Dine appears as the narrator (characters will refer to his presence in their dialogue, but Van Dine has no dialogue). Oddly enough, some of the Philo Vance novels depicted him murdering the murderer. However, Van Dine established that Philo Vance had retired to Italy, whose fascist government probably would not have extradited him.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleryQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleryQueen">Ellery Queen</a></em> books, aping as they did the <em>Philo Vance</em> series early on, present several convoluted uses of this trope. Early novels, starting with the first, <em>The Roman Hat Mystery</em> in 1929, have framing sequences which establish that the stories actually took place in the previous decade, i.e., the 1910s, and that all of the names have been changed. In other words, "Ellery Queen" was a pseudonym not only in real life, but in the novels as well.

In <em>She and Allan</em> (which takes place before <em>She</em> and before <em>Allan Quatermain</em>, for important reasons), Allan Quatermain writes an introduction to his memoirs of meeting Ayesha. He mentions that he will have the author publish his memoirs (the other Allan Quatermain novels follow a similar format, with some novels referring to other novels by their book titles). Quatermain mentions that he actually read Haggard's book <em>She</em>, and notes that the claim by one of the residents of Kor in that book that no male Caucasian had visited Kor in decades stood as false, since Quatermain had visited Kor within the last fifteen years. (Curiously, Allan Quatermain died in the 1887 novel <em>Allan Quatermain</em> — published the same year as <em>She</em>. Quatermain must have read <em>She</em> not long before his death.)

A lot of what he tells is mixed with actual places and people, so sometimes you will be surprised that this is just life embellished, and not a tall tale.

In the 1960 movie adaptation of <em>The Time Machine</em>, the Time Traveler is referred to as "George". However, the time machine's date indicator plate clearly reads "Manufactured by H.

</li><li> In his novels <em>Tarzan Alive</em> and <em>Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s claims that Edgar Rice Burroughs and Lester Dent were just the biographers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan">Tarzan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage">Doc Savage</a>. He claims that their books were highly fictionalized and sensationalized and presents somewhat more mundane, but still sensational versions of the stories that correct various factual inaccuracies and continuity errors. For example, he explains that whenever Tarzan encountered a lion, a plains-dwelling animal, in the jungle, it was actually a leopard and Burroughs exaggerated because lions were bigger and more dangerous looking. He also tries to explain away both characters' great strength and intelligence by claiming their <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wold_Newton_family">ancestors were irradiated by a meteor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and that other relatives of Tarzan and Savage whose ancestors were exposed to that radiation include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FuManchu">Fu Manchu</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BulldogDrummond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BulldogDrummond">Bulldog Drummond</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer">Philip José Farmer</a> is in a class of his own.
<ul><li> There's a lovely moment in <em>Tarzan Alive</em> when Tarzan tells Farmer the actual story behind one particular book, adding that the secondary hero's love interest was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">killed by a hit-and-run in New York City some six months after the book ends</a>. Farmer comments that he likes Burroughs' version better (the lovers stay in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld">medieval city</a> in Africa), and Tarzan smiles and says, "He knew what he was doing."
</li><li> Edgar Rice Burroughs himself used the Direct Line to the Author approach for Tarzan, the Barsoom novels, and much of his other work. This makes Farmer's approach of representing literary agent material as a different literary agent. In the Barsoom novels, Burroughs went so far as to claim that John Carter was his beloved uncle.

Of course I wanted to: the unraveling of the case via the patient, intelligent investigation work of the department in general, and Virgil Tibbs in particular, would need no embellishment in the telling. As I always do in such instances, I called Virgil and suggested a meeting. Two nights later we sat down to dine together in one of Pasadena's very fine restaurants........By the time that the main course had been put down in front of us we had gone over the Morales case in detail and Virgil had filled me in on several points which had not previously been made public. As always, I agreed to publish nothing until the department had read the manuscript and had given it an official approval. This procedure helped to eliminate possible errors and also made sure that I had not unintentionally included information which was still confidential." Later Tibbs says "I have a letter from Otto Penzler" I said. Virgil nodded recognition. "The co-author with Steinbrunner of The Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection? I have a copy." "Otto has asked me for a piece about your background. How much may I tell him?" I should insert a footnote here. Virgil Tibbs is basically a quiet, self-effacing man....He has mentioned to me more than once that my accounts of some of his cases have proved somewhat embarrassing to him. However, Chief McGowan feels that these books help explain the police function to the citizenry at large and to show how modern, enlightened police departments function."

</div></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Ebenezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Ebenezer">Ebenezer</a></em>, Charles Dickens, upon learning the truth that Scrooge knew and didn't care about Marley's crimes, storms out in a disgusted rage. It's implied that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> we know is what he deemed worthy to publish, omitting said events, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">keeping Scrooge's love interest alive</span>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a>:
<ul><li> Peter Spear's hint books for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> series contain a link from Spear to some of the characters. The former around the idea that a journalist named Derek Karlavaegen had discovered ways to "e-mail" stories to Peter Spear, and the latter around the idea that Roger Wilco had written his memoirs and sent them back in time to Sierra, who turned them into the <em>Space Quest</em> games, and the raw memoirs were the novelizations that the book featured.
</li><li> In <em>Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon</em>, Roger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">delivers in-game versions of the creators of the <em>Space Quest</em> games to Sierra on Earth, with whom they presumably go on to make... the <em>Space Quest</em> games.</span>
</li><li> The copy protection of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVIHeirTodayGoneTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVIHeirTodayGoneTomorrow">King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow</a></em> is also attributed to Derek Karlaveagen. It is basically a record of his travels in the Land of the Green Isles, including some clues to solve certain puzzles (they were impossible to solve without the booklet).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPig">Lost Pig</a></em> is supposedly by Grunk, the player character, "as told to" the game's programmer. The supporting material includes commentary by the programmer expressing his doubts about the accuracy of some of the details.
</li><li> The first four <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> titles, along with the tie-in novels, are supposedly based (Tolkien-style) on translations of the character Catherine's journals. This is taken even further with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst">Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> counterpart <em>Myst Online: Uru Live</em>, in which the D'ni cavern is portrayed as a real place — in New Mexico, of all places - being rediscovered by a team of expeditionary archaeologists funding their research by selling the rights to certain historical documents it uncovered to the game company Cyan, which used them as the basis for the <em>Myst</em> games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBeginnersGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBeginnersGuide">The Beginner's Guide</a></em> is narrated by its real-life creator Davey Wreden, who presents it as a compilation of games created by his friend Coda. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, messages by Coda near the end beg Davey to stop publishing his work. One could imagine that the release of <em>The Beginner's Guide</em> would not be helpful if the story was true. Also according to one message, Davey lied about the lampposts being a recurring element in Coda's work, having them put in there himself.</span>
</li><li> At the denouement of <em>Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper</em>, it's strongly implied that Watson <em>made up</em> the "Hound of the Baskervilles" case, to cover up the fact that he and Holmes had actually been in London at the time, where they'd solved the Whitechapel murders. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The in-game killer was Jewish, and Holmes knew that preventing an anti-Semitic bloodbath by outraged Londoners was more important than revealing the truth, so he had the man locked up in secret.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TengaiMakyou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TengaiMakyou">Tengai Makyou</a></em>: Supposedly, the whole plot of the three main games and spin-offs is based on a book named <em>Far East of Eden</em> written by some American guy named Paul Hieronymus Chada and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HudsonSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HudsonSoft">Hudson Soft</a> themselves decided to adapt his book into a videogame and call it <em>Tengai Makyou</em>. Or more precisely, Ouji Hiroi (the creator) managed to get that book, translated it to Japanese <em>somewhat</em> and tried to tell the plot of the book somehow. How much of the content of that book was true, <em>exaggerated</em> by Chada (or Hiroi) or how the hell Chada got all these chronicles in the first place remains a mystery for everyone.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys Eternal</a></em>'s loading screen and the opening movie of <em>Ys II Eternal</em>, the games are actually 'novels' translated from Adol's own journals. This serves as a nice handwave for things like the blatant differences between <em>Mask of the Sun</em> and <em>Dawn of Ys</em>. This conceit was carried forward into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsTheOathInFelghana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsTheOathInFelghana">Ys: The Oath in Felghana</a></em>, though oddly enough not into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsSEVEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsSEVEN">Ys SEVEN</a></em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsMemoriesOfCelceta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsMemoriesOfCelceta">Ys: Memories of Celceta</a></em> picks it up again in the game's intro and in the companion "journal" that comes in the limited edition.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood">Achewood</a></em>: There is a conceit that Onstad is just representing actual events, and shares a house with Téodor, Cornelius and Philippe. This has become less central to the comic as time goes on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LaughOutLoudCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LaughOutLoudCats">Laugh-Out-Loud Cats</a></em>: The comics were supposedly drawn in the 1900s, turned down by newspapers and spent a century in an attic until the artist's grand-grandson Adam Koford found them.
</li><li> The storyteller from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> is all but stated to be Phil Foglio, and the series is him re-telling what he knows of Agatha's rise to power. Though he also admits in-story that he's been exposed to so many mind-altering chemicals and energies that he can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">be sure exactly what happened</a>. The novelization confirms that the Storyteller is supposed to be Phil Foglio.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Namesake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Namesake">Namesake</a></em> uses the idea that some people travel to parallel worlds and famous real-world authors are just writing the stories of those travelers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Unsounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Unsounded">Unsounded</a></em>: Letters written by a researcher who found Duane's journal are inserted here and there, implying that the comic is (possibly) pieced together from his and other accounts.

<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> had Darkwing accidentally travel to a parallel world in which there was a cartoon series based on him. He eventually learned that the creator of the cartoon had a piece of technology that allowed him to overhear the "real" Darkwing on his many adventures, and then adapted those adventures to a cartoon show. The episode ends with Darkwing having destroyed the device's connection to his world but instead, we hear from it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipAndDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipAndDaleRescueRangers">Chip and Dale on one of their own adventures</a>.

She takes her experience and creates a children's television show out of it, which is very successful. However, when it's revealed that she was just getting her ideas from observing the creatures on said planet and not coming up with them herself, the production crew simply stops relying on her for new content, sets up shop on the planet itself, and re-markets the show as a reality series for kids</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:

After some initial confusion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> posits the authors wrote under "some sort of psychic link to this world" unknowingly.
