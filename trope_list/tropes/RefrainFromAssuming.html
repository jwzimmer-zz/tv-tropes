Also, songs are frequently played on the radio (or by friends) with no introduction, so the best anyone can do for identification is typing whatever line is most memorable into Google with "lyrics" after it or humming a few bars.
</p><p>Songs that outlast their initial airplay popularity to become incorporated into other works such as films and video games as background music are particularly vulnerable to this, as contemporary listeners can catch the title being mentioned by a radio DJ or see the credits of the music video.
</p><p>As a general rule, if the song title is given as "Phrase 1 (Phrase 2)", it's probably this type of song. Phrase 1 is the official title and Phrase 2 is the line that repeatedly appears in the lyrics that everyone <em>thinks</em> is the title. Or sometimes the other way around, which apparently represents the musicians giving up and titling the song what everyone calls it anyway, but retaining their original title in parenthetized form.

When reading a script or music sheet, "Start at <em>Vesti la giubba</em>" is a much easier instruction to follow than "Start from the beginning of the bit that contains <em>Ridi, Pagliaccio!</em>."</span>, so this trope never applies to them if you're good at catching words in Italian or German. Of course, there's the catch of being able to tell where songs begin, as they sometimes begin with sung dialogue<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rs2d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1rs2d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rs2d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">called "recitative"</span> rather than with actual song. People who assume that the song's name is the most prominent words in the text, such as someone referring to the "nessun dorma" aria as "vincerò, vincerò!", will be discreetly labelled "beginner" by the rest of the group and anyone talking with them is politely "dumbing down" for them or offering to explain (the shift towards the more well-known titles has been happening recently, though).

<ul><li> Four Non Blondes' biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">(only?)</a> hit is not "What's Going On", It's "What's Up". The former title was avoided so it wouldn't be mistaken for a cover of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a> song of that name.
<ul><li> Neither is it called "HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">for those who only know it</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man</a></em> music video. And even <em>that</em> isn't the full video's title, which is "Fabulous Secret Powers."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SixteenHorsepower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SixteenHorsepower">16 Horsepower</a> did this very often. Most notable is "Coal Black Horses," the chorus of which repeats the name-friendly phrase "Hey hey hey, it's always forever, hey hey hey, never or now". Other examples are "Hang my teeth on your door", "Neck on the new blade" and "The Denver Grab."
</li><li> <em>Abwärts</em>, a legendary German punk band. When you google for "Der Westen ist einsam", you find their album, and even a cover of the song from that album which took the "wrong" name...but the song, while having the phrase in the lyrics, itself is titled "Affentanz".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams">Bryan Adams</a> song is "Summer of '69", not "Best Days of My Life." Both phrases feature in the lyrics, but "best days of my life" ends the chorus, a typical position for a title, while "the summer of '69" appears once in a verse and then forms the outro. Interestingly, the original title <em>was</em> "Best Days of My Life," and the phrase appeared much more often in the first draft of the lyrics.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>:
<ul><li> While recording their legendary "Raising Hell" album, rap pioneers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RunDMC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RunDMC">RunD.M.C.</a> had problems tracking down Aerosmith to ask them to collaborate on the remake of their "Walk This Way." The reason? As Russell "Rapper's Run" Simmons admitted later, they thought both the band and the song were "Toys in the Attic" (which was both the name of the album "Walk This Way" appeared on and a completely different song on that album).
</li><li> It's "Rag Doll," not "Livin' in a Movie", "Daddy's Little Cutie," "Old Tin Lizzy," or anything else.
</li><li> It is also not well-known that the official title of "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" includes the parentheses.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AesopRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AesopRock">Aesop Rock</a>'s song (under the moniker of Hail Mary Mallon) that talks about the increasingly outlandish ways to spend currency, with the catchy hook of "Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, motherfucker", is actually called "Whales".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AFI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AFI">AFI</a>:
<ul><li> If someone mentions "Kiss My Eyes and Lay Me to Sleep," they're probably thinking of "Prelude 12/21."
</li><li> In the same vein, "As We All Form One Dark Flame," "Love Your Hate," or "You Are Now One of Us," is actually "Miseria Cantare (The Beginning)".
</li></ul></li><li> The Afroman song that people keep calling "Colt 45" is called "Crazy Rap." "Colt 45" is a COMPLETELY different song from the same artist.
</li><li> "Here I Am" and "The One That You Love" are two different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AirSupply" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AirSupply">Air Supply</a> songs (the fact that they're both from the same album, which is <em>also</em> titled "The One That You Love", doesn't help a bit... to make matters even worse, the songs were also released as the A and B sides of the same single). The former is sometimes referred to as "Just When I Thought I Was Over You" to try to head off the confusion.
</li><li> The name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject">The Alan Parsons Project</a>'s biggest hit in America is not "I Can Read Your Mind," but "Eye in the Sky." Both lines occur in the chorus, but the former is the one at the end of the chorus and the one that repeats most often.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a> big hit from the early nineties is called "Would?" <em>not</em> "Into the Flood (Again)."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlterBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlterBridge">Alter Bridge</a> song that professional wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> uses as his entrance music is called "Metalingus", not "On This Day."
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ambrosia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ambrosia">Ambrosia</a>'s "Biggest Part of Me" is usually mistakenly referred to by its repeated choral refrain: "Make a Wish."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/America" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/America">America</a> doesn't have a song called "Will You Meet Me in the Middle?" That's "Sister Golden Hair."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos">Tori Amos</a> never released a song called "Starfucker." It's "Professional Widow." (Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> <em>did</em> have a "Starfucker." Their record company made them change it to "Star Star.")
</li><li> The Amity Affliction do not have a song called "Let The Ocean Take Me", it's "Don't Lean On Me". Another example where the actual title does appear in the lyrics, though not as prominently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anberlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anberlin">Anberlin</a>:
<ul><li> It's "The Feel Good Drag," not "Was This Over Before (Before It Ever Began)" or any variation thereof.
</li><li> "Fin" is not called "Patron Saint of Lost Causes."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anastacia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anastacia">Anastacia</a>'s song "I'm Outta Love" is often misnamed "Set Me Free." The former does appear in the refrain but is not as obvious.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnimalCollective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnimalCollective">Animal Collective</a> has never released a song called "Open Up Your Throat." The actual name of the song is "Brother Sport."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire">Arcade Fire</a> song "Rebellion (Lies)" never has the word "rebellion" occur in its lyrics; it has the word "lies" only in the backup vocals, but it is repeated many times back there.
</li><li> Tasmin Archer's biggest hit wasn't called "I Blame You For The Moonlit Sky" or any variation thereof. Rather, it's title was "Sleeping Satellite", the last words in the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Archive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Archive">Archive</a>'s song "Bullets," which was used in a teaser for the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberpunk2077" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberpunk2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>, is sometimes called "Personal Responsibility."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcticMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcticMonkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a>' signature song is called "Do I Wanna Know," not "Crawling Back to You."
</li><li> Looking for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua">Aqua</a> song "Candyman"? No such title, it's "Lollipop." Perhaps the more obvious phrase was not used as the title in an attempt to avoid people confusing it with the Sammy Davis song "The Candy Man".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JosephArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JosephArthur">Joseph Arthur</a>'s "In the Sun" is often known as "May God's Love Be with You" or "If I Find My Way," both of which appear at noticeable turning points in the song.
</li><li> Back in the sixties, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicRooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicRooster">Atomic Rooster</a> did a song which was called "Devil's Answer", and not the repeated imperative "Change!"
</li><li> That one song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAvalanches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAvalanches">The Avalanches</a> isn't "That Boy Needs Therapy", it's "Frontier Psychiatrist".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvengedSevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a> does not have a song called "I'm Not Insane." The song that repeatedly uses that line is called "Almost Easy."
<ul><li> The song commonly known as "You Can't Win This Fight" is actually "Welcome to the Family"
</li><li> It's "Bat Country", not "Caught Here in a Fiery Blaze".
</li></ul></li><li> Neither Baby Bash nor Robin Schulz have a song called "Sugar, How You Get So Fly". The Baby Bash song is called "Suga Suga" while the Robin Schulz version is "Sugar".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bananarama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bananarama">Bananarama</a> never made a song called "Your Desire" nor did they ever do one titled "Goddess on the Mountaintop" or "She's Got It". However they <em>did</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover</a> Shocking Blue's song "Venus."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand">The Band</a>'s "The Weight" is not called "Take a Load Off, Fanny" or "I Pulled Into Nazareth" (although that last one <em>would</em> have been a cool title).
</li><li> Music/Bastille's "Pompeii" is not called "Close Your Eyes".
<ul><li> On the other hand, "Laura Palmer" is not called "This Is Your Heart"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles">Sara Bareilles</a>:
<ul><li> Did you think she did "Head Underwater" or "I'm Not Gonna Write You a Love Song"? It's actually titled "Love Song."
</li><li> Did you think she made "You Are Not Me (Who Made You King of Anything?)"? It's simply "King of Anything."
</li><li> Did you think she made "I'll Be All Right, Just Not Tonight?" It's actually "Gonna Get Over You."

<ul><li> To add to the confusion, while the Beach Boys' version has made "Sloop John B" the most popular title, the song had previously been recorded by many other acts under many other titles, most commonly "The John B.

The Beatles liked the song's opening line and proceeded to use it as the opening lyric of their own song, but obviously, they had to give it a different title. Interestingly, James Taylor had originally wanted his song to be titled "I Feel Fine," after a more dominant line in the chorus, but <em>that</em> title was already taken by a Beatles song!</span>
</li><li> The Beatles never recorded a song called "Please Don't Be Long." Despite this lyric occurring many times throughout the song, its actual name is "Blue Jay Way" which is only said once in the song.
<ul><li> They did, however, record a song called "It Won't Be Long", which opens their second album, <em>With The Beatles</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Eleanor Rigby" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Revolver">Revolver</a></em> is not "All the Lonely People" or "Look at all the Lonely People."

</li><li> "The Ballad of John and Yoko" isn't "You Know It Ain't Easy" or "They're Gonna Crucify Me." And it has no relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a>'s solo hit "It Don't Come Easy," either.

<ul><li> The band does not have a song called "Say It Ain't So." That song is called "All the Small Things."
</li><li> blink-182 (or their fans) later inverted this before releasing their last album. When a version of the first track was released, many people began calling it "Action" because you can hear a sport's commentator saying "Get ready for action!" at the beginning of the song, despite the fact that "Feeling This" is literally every other line in the song. When the album was released, the song was titled "Feeling This."
</li><li> And their song "Dammit" doesn't once use that word.
</li><li> Nor is Adam mentioned anywhere in "Adam's Song."

</li></ul></li><li> Also, "Fire Water Burn" isn't named "The Roof is On Fire".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Blondie</a>'s hit from 1981 is not titled "The Man From Mars", it's "Rapture". The rap portion of the song, providing a detailed list of actions by that man is actually more memorable than the singing portion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult">Blue Öyster Cult</a> fans have this problem all the time, particularly given the band's frequent use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSalad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSalad">Word Salad</a> titles and the sheer wordiness of their lyrics. Below, some of their songs (on the left, the actual title; on the right, the title most fans think of):
<ul><li> "Hot Rails to Hell" = "Burn Your Eyes Out"
</li><li> "7 Screaming Diz-Busters" = "Lucifer the Light"
</li><li> "Flaming Telepaths" = "The Joke's on You"
</li><li> "Extraterrestrial Intelligence" = "Balthazar"
</li><li> "Sinful Love" = "Daredevil"
</li><li> Ironically inverted with "The Golden Age of Leather." Everybody knows the song title, but it's mentioned once at the beginning of the song (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutOpening">"glee-club" opening</a>) and then is never mentioned again.
</li><li> Oddly with "Tattoo Vampire", where the title is indeed sung several times toward the end of the song, but in such a way that it sounds like "Vampire Tattoo".
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bluetones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bluetones">Bluetones</a>' biggest hit is called "Slight Return," despite these words not appearing anywhere in the song; it's more usually known by the chorus, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in their later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> "Armageddon (Outta Here)":
<div class="indent">Student 1: What's their hit? "Slight Return," that's the one. <br/>Student 2: Oh, I don't know that one, I only know the one that goes "you don't have to have the solution, you've got to invest in the problem". <br/>Student 1: Yeah, that's "Slight Return." <br/>Student 2: Oh. I thought it was called "You Don't Have To Have The Solution, You've Got To Invest In The Problem." <br/>Student 1: No. <br/>Student 2: Oh.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a>'s "Song 2" is often called "Woo Hoo" after the chorus. This may be a cautionary tale for bands: if you're going to give your song the second most generic title possible (at least there's a number instead of just calling it "Song"), fans <em>will</em> invent their own name for it. The fact that Damon Albarn's lyrics are mostly incomprehensible otherwise doesn't help.
<ul><li> Their other song — the one with the spoken-word verses by Phil Daniels — isn't called "All the People" or "Hand in Hand" or anything like that. Its title is the last word of the chorus, "Parklife."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBlunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBlunt">James Blunt</a>'s song isn't called "Here we go again", but "1973".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricBogle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricBogle">Eric Bogle</a> song "No Man's Land" is sometimes known as (and has been recorded under) the alternate title "Green Fields of France".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a>:
<ul><li> "Shot Through the Heart" and "You Give Love a Bad Name" are two different songs. To add to the confusion, both start with the words "Shot through the heart"...
</li><li> Although "You Give Love a Bad Name" uses its title twice in the refrain, and "Shot through the heart" is only heard once in the refrain.
</li></ul></li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">Space Oddity</a></em> is "Space Oddity," not "Major Tom." Peter Schilling's new-wave sequel to Bowie's song, on the other hand, <em>was</em> titled "Major Tom" despite there being no mention of Tom in the chorus. It's sometimes referred to as "Coming Home" (its subtitle) <br/><br/>To add to the confusion, Peter Schilling has two "Major Tom" songs. One takes the themes of the Bowie song and runs with them — "Major Tom (Coming Home)," the second one is "Major Tom, Part 2" (the first one was the hit). Or, in the original German version of the former, as "Major Tom (völlig losgelöst)"; the parenthetical part features very prominently in the chorus.

</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LauraBranigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LauraBranigan">Laura Branigan</a> song sometimes known as "Creatures of the Night" is titled "Self Control" (a line that does appear in the song as "you take my self control" but is not as clearly enunciated as the mistaken title).
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bravery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bravery">Bravery</a> song with the chorus "I just want love" is actually called "Unconditional."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BreakingBenjamin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BreakingBenjamin">Breaking Benjamin</a>'s first single in six years is not called "Tear The Whole World Down." It's actually called "Failure."

</li></ul></li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BringMeTheHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BringMeTheHorizon">Bring Me the Horizon</a> song is not called "This is Sempiternal." It's called "Shadow Moses."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown">James Brown</a>:
<ul><li> His most famous song is called "I Got You (I Feel Good)," not "I Feel Good." (Initially, the song's title was just "I Got You" without the subtitle. The original version has shown up on several compilations over the years.)
</li><li> His second-most famous is not "Sex Machine," or "Get Up," or "Get On Up," but has the baffling title "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BT">BT</a>:
<ul><li> The only single off of <em>Emotional Technology</em> is actually titled "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)." Between 75% of the refrain consisting of the subtitle and the U.S. home version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">DDR Extreme</a></em> including it with the title switched around, it's usually referred to as just "Simply Being Loved." (In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">it doesn't even have its main title in the lyrics.</a> The closest it somes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">title-dropping</a> is : "So little joy, so little joy / It's complicated / I feel I'm stumbling in the dark / Somnambulated.")
</li><li> There is no song titled "Do You Cry Your Eyes Asleep." That's "The Horse of Gravity," whose title appears but once. Most of the remixes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChorusOnlySong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChorusOnlySong">only use the refrain</a>, completely leaving out the title.

Or some variation on the lines "They were all in love with dying/They were doing it in Texas."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a> didn't do a song called "I'm Going to Catch That Horse." The title is "Chestnut Mare".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cake">CAKE</a>:
<ul><li> "Nugget" is often mistitled "Shut The Fuck Up," since the latter phrase makes up about half the chorus and it's got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>. Chicken McNuggets get mentioned in the lyrics, but that probably couldn't have been used as a title without getting in trouble with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a>.
</li><li> "The Distance" is often known instead as "She's Going The Distance".

<ul><li> "Shadow Stabbing" is not "Say It All," "Outside" or any of the other lyrics that actually appear in the song.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cardigans' "Lovefool" is sometimes referred to as "Love Me, Love Me" (or just "Love Me") — there's an almost-but-not-quite title drop in the chorus: "<strong>Love</strong> me, love me / Say that you love me / <strong>Fool</strong> me, fool me / go on and fool me." Adding to the confusion is the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> adapted the chorus of "Lovefool" into his song "Love Me."

</li><li> It's "Close to You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters">Carpenters</a>, not "Why Do Birds Suddenly Appear." This one is interesting, because "close to you" features often and prominently in the chorus, while "Why do birds suddenly appear" occurs only once as the first line in the song. It being the first line is why it's mistaken to be the title, as whenever the song shows up in films and television shows, the first line is prominently heard (usually during a "falling in love" moment) while most of the rest is quickly interrupted.
<ul><li> Also by The Carpenters: It's "Yesterday Once More", not "Every Sha-La-La-La".
</li></ul></li><li> Despite most of the stanzas of the song begin with an emphatic "Right now", the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood">Carrie Underwood</a>'s song is "Before He Cheats".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars">The Cars</a>:
<ul><li> The big hit is entitled "You Might Think", not "All I Want Is You".
</li><li> It's "Let's Go," not "I Like The Nightlife Baby."
</li><li> "Here She Comes Again" doesn't exist, the actual title is "My Best Friend's Girl".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Cascada</a>'s song "Love Again" is much better known as "The Summer Belongs to You."

</li><li> The Chainsmokers don't have a song called "Say You'll Never Let Me Go." It's called "Roses," which is never said in the lyrics (the singer of the song just happens to go by the stage name "Rozes").
<ul><li> "#SELFIE" is not called "Let Me Take a Selfie."
</li><li> They also never did anything called "We Ain't Ever Getting Older," even though that line quickly became a motto. The song you're looking for is "Closer".
</li></ul></li><li> Chamillionaire's 2005 hit is not called "Ridin' Dirty" or "Tryin' to Catch Me Ridin' Dirty" - it's just "Ridin'". Thanks to the first phrase of its chorus becoming a meme, it is also sometimes mistakenly referred to as "They See Me Rolling".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chic">Chic</a>'s disco hit was not titled "Freak Out!" It's "Le Freak." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">C'est Chic</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a>: "Call On Me" and "Questions 67 and 68" have too many phrases in the chorus to list all possible alternate titles(and in the latter, the title is only sung by Peter Cetera at the very end).
<ul><li> 25 Or 6 To 4 is not called, despite appearances, "Waiting For The Break of Day."

For example "I. The Worst Guys" is not called "All She Needed Was Some" and "Flight of the Navigator" isn't "Hold Me Close My Darling". He also does the parenthetical type of this trope a couple times, with "Telegraph Ave. (Oakland by Lloyd)" and "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)".
<ul><li> Also seen on a lot of the songs on <em>I AM JUST A RAPPER</em> and <em>I AM JUST A RAPPER 2</em>, as the format Gambino used for basically all of them was his title followed by the sample title, which often turned out to provide the memorable hook, in parentheses.
</li><li> His hit single from summer 2017 is not called "Daylight" or "Don't You Close Your Eyes". Those lines come from his song "Redbone", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">a word that doesn't even show up in the lyrics.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The words "Train in Vain" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">never appear in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a>'s song of that name. It's commonly known as "Stand by Me" for lyrics that <em>do</em> appear in the song. (The title is probably a reference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a> classic "Love in Vain".) Part of the problem with this example is that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">wasnt on the track listing</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling">London Calling</a> due to being hastily added after the album sleeves were already produced.

</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMCohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMCohan">George M Cohan</a> song "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" was originally titled "The Yankee Doodle Boy" (and the last line of the chorus <em>is</em> "I am that Yankee Doodle boy").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria">Coheed and Cambria</a>'s song "A Favor House Atlantic" often gets this treatment, being referred to as "Good Eye Sniper", the first line of the refrain, or as "Bye Bye Beautiful", the first line of the chorus. "Time Consumer" is often called "Matthew, Goodnight", or "Maria, My Star, Matthew Goodnight", which are the most easily understood lyrics. (Granted, many of Coheed's song titles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">aren't included as lyrics in the song</a>, and only make sense if the listener takes the titles in the context of the Amory Wars storyline.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> has a lot of counterintuitive song titles:
<ul><li> "Fix You" is not called "Lights Will Guide You Home". The title comes from the last words of the chorus, rather than the first.
</li><li> "Politik" could easily get mislabeled as "Open Up Your Eyes", since that line is shouted loudly numerous consecutive times, while the word "Politik" only appears twice and doesn't sound important.
</li><li> "Don't Panic" is not called "We Live In A Beautiful World"
</li><li> "Viva La Vida" has many title-esque lines in it (some may call the song "When I Ruled The World"), but the phrase "Viva La Vida" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">isn't in there at all</a>, although it is part of the title of its album — <em>Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends</em> ("Death and All His Friends" being the name of the last(ish) song on the album.)
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wikicoldplay.com/Charlie_Brown#Lyrics_.28official.29">"Charlie Brown"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> does not contain the phrase "Charlie Brown" and has no obvious relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Charlie Brown</a>. From the lyrics, the song sounds like it's called "Glowing In The Dark" (which is repeated prominently 3 times). Some incorrectly list the song name as "Cartoon Heart" due to the lyric halfway through the song; the fact that this <em>was</em> the original name of the song doesn't help either.
</li><li> "Adventure of a Lifetime" may be seen as "Turn Your Magic On" (said in the verses and the bridge) or "Alive Again" (chorus).
</li><li> "The Scientist", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, is not called 'Nobody Said It Was Easy', 'Let's Go/Take Me Back To The Start', 'You Don't Know How <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Lovely/Lucky</a> You Are' or anything else from the lyrics.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>:
<ul><li> "Something Happened on the Way to Heaven" is named after an line in the second verse. Based on the chorus, a more predictable title might be "How Many Times" or "How Many Times (Can I Say I'm Sorry?) or some variation, the line that ends both verses, or "Please Believe in Me", which is the line that ends the chorus.
</li><li> "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" — as the bracketed title would suggest — is frequently known as "Take a Look at Me Now". (Just to complicate matters, the song is named for the <em>movie</em> in which it appeared. In the lyrics, the line is "against <em>the</em> odds": It is sung as "against all odds" only in the last verse, and not in all versions of the song.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumTitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumTitleDrop">Album Title Drops</a> are a frequent victim of this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>'s "Brilliant Mistake" is often thought to be called "King of America" because it's the title of the album and the first line of the song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton">Jonathan Coulton</a>:
<ul><li> The love song from an evil villain to his female captive is titled "Skullcrusher Mountain", not "I'm So Into You". The latter phrase appears in the chorus; the title appears at the beginning of every verse.
</li><li> His song about a zombie wanting to eat his colleague's brains isn't titled "All We Wanna Do Is Eat Your Brains", nor is it "Eat Your Brains" or any other variation on that. The song is actually titled "Re: Your Brains" ("re" is short for "regarding", not "reply" - it's meant to look like a business email subject header).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCowsills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCowsills">The Cowsills</a> did not do a song called "The Flower Girl"; that's "The Rain, the Park, and Other Things".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cracker">Cracker</a>:
<ul><li> "Low" is frequently called "Like Being Stoned" (or just "Stoned"); the title <em>is</em> in the chorus, it's just not the part people tend to remember for some reason.
</li><li> Another song's title is "Teen Angst", not "What the World Needs Now".
</li></ul></li><li> That "In Your Head" song by The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cranberries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cranberries">Cranberries</a>? It's actually called "Zombie".
<ul><li> The fact that Eminem used the chorus as a sampled chorus in one of his songs ACTUALLY titled "In Your Head" is likely not helping
</li></ul></li><li> Crazy Town never recorded a song titled "Come My Lady" or "Sugar Baby". It's actually called "Butterfly", which isn't by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LimpBizkit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LimpBizkit">Limp Bizkit</a> either.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreatureFeature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreatureFeature">Creature Feature</a> never released a song called "We Are Coming For You". That appears in "The Unearthly Ones".

<ul><li> Once, all three panelists on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> gave questions to a Final Answer answers that were all variations of "What is 'Rolling on the River'?" The song is called "Proud Mary".
</li><li> There is no CCR song titled "Some Folks" or "It Ain't Me". It's "Fortunate Son".
</li></ul></li><li> "One Last Breath" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Creed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Creed">Creed</a> might be better known as "Hold Me Now" or "Six Feet From The Edge", both of which prominently appear as part of the chorus. The actual song title shows up in the penultimate lines of the first two verses.
<ul><li> Nor have they ever recorded a song called "Look at Me." That would be "Bullets."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimCroce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimCroce">Jim Croce</a> had two songs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non Appearing Titles</a>: "Age" ("I've traded love for pennies, sold my soul for less . . ." and "Thursday" ("I was looking for a lifetime lover, and you were looking for a friend.")
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cryoshell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cryoshell">Cryoshell</a>:
<ul><li> "Creeping in my Soul" is sometimes subjected to this. Due to a repeated refrain, it is often called "Creeps from the Deep". Creeping in my soul is also repeated several times throughout the song, but part of the confusion stems from the fact that the song was featured in a video called <em>Creeps from the Deep</em>. For whatever reason, it is also sometimes has the subtitle "Deep Dive" added to the title (ie. "Creeping in my Soul (Deep Dive))".
</li><li> They also have a song "Closer to the Truth", often called "Take me Home", as that phrase is uttered multiple times throughout the song, while the title is buried at the end of the chorus.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a>:
<ul><li> "A Forest" has been referred to as "Into the Trees".
</li><li> "Let's Go to Bed" saves that part for the very end. Those words aren't uttered at all in the chorus.
</li><li> They didn't make a song called "I Will Always Love You". It's "Lovesong", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">doesn't appear in the song</a> but obviously describes its content.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyCurrington">Billy Currington</a>'s "Good Directions" has the title only at the very end.

</li><li> Denzel Curry's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">infamous</a> rap is not called "I Am The One" - it's "Ultimate".
</li><li> The most well-known song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CypressHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CypressHill">Cypress Hill</a> is called "Insane in the Brain", <em>not</em> "Insane in the Membrane". Easy to confuse, because the latter is said far more often than the former in the song.
</li><li> One of the most known songs by Gigi D'Agostino is known as "I'll Fly With You", while the original title of the song is "L'amour Toujours". Note that the song is entirely in English, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">there's no</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">Gratuitous French</a> in the lyrics.
</li><li> The Dandy Warhols' most well known song "Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth" is not called "I Never Thought You'd Be a Junkie" or "Heroin Is So Passé", the two often repeated lines in the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">Reggae</a> duo Dave &amp; Ansell Collins had two big international hits with two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> songs: "Double Barrel" (not "I am the Magnificent") and "Monkey Spanner" (not "Heavy Heavy Monster Sound").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a>'s signature hit is not called "You Spin Me Right Round", but "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)". "Right Round" <em>is</em> the name of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida">Flo Rida</a> song heavily based upon it, however.
</li><li> A great many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathCabForCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathCabForCutie">Death Cab for Cutie</a> songs have their title only appear once, outside of the refrain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">or not at all</a>:
<ul><li> It's "Crooked Teeth", not "Nothing There All Along". The title only appears once in the lyrics.
</li><li> "Marching Bands of Manhattan" is often mistaken as "Your Love Is Gonna Drown"
</li><li> "Grapevine Fires" is not called "A Matter of Time" or "Before We All Burn".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver">John Denver</a>:
<ul><li> "Annie's Song", one of his biggest hits, never mentions the name Annie anywhere in the lyrics. People who don't know the real title tend to assume it's called "You Fill Up My Senses" or "Come Let Me Love You".
</li><li> By the same token, "Annie's Other Song" is often assumed to be called "I'm Bringin' Me Home to You".
</li></ul></li><li> William DeVaughn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">only hit single</a> wasn't titled "Diamond in the Back", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">which is often miscredited to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CurtisMayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CurtisMayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a>, but rather "Be Thankful For What You've Got]]".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits">Dire Straits</a>' biggest hit is "Money for Nothing", not "I Want My MTV", "Chicks For Free", "Microwave Ovens", or "Colour TVs".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s parody of the song is called "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*", not just "Beverly Hillbillies". And yes, both the title of the original <em>and</em> the asterisk are part of the title.
</li><li> Even if you "Tell Me All Your Thoughts On God", the fact remains that the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dishwalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dishwalla">Dishwalla</a> song that begins the chorus with those lyrics is actually called "Counting Blue Cars".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a>:
<ul><li> "Meaning of Life" is often called "Get Psycho".
</li><li> "Conflict" is often called "Enemy". Probably because "enemy" is <em>every fifth word</em>. To put it into perspective, the song is about 250 words long at 4:35. The word "Enemy" is used at least 52 times. So yes, this song is indeed made 1/5 "Enemy".
</li><li> "Voices" is often called "Are You Breathing?" due to the line being said numerous times throughout the song and chorus. The title comes from the line: "I can the hear the voice."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan">Donovan</a>:
<ul><li> It's "Sunshine Superman", not "I've Made My Mind Up" or "You're Going to Be Mine." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> comes with the relatively unobtrusive line "Superman and Green Lantern ain't got, uh, nothing on me."
</li><li> His song "Atlantis" (best known for it's usage in the infamous Billy Batts scene in Goodfellas) is often known as "Way Down Below The Ocean" due to that being the first words actually sung in the song.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoobieBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoobieBrothers">Doobie Brothers</a> never made a song called "Without Love". It's "Long Train Runnin'".

</li><li> Even though the lyrics to one of their songs say "We stand before the dawn of a new world", the actual title is "Dawn <strong>over</strong> a New World".
</li><li> "A Flame for Freedom" has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>. It is not called "Heart of a Nation" or any other line from the lyrics.

That's the case for "Life in a Northern Town" by The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamAcademy">Dream Academy</a>, otherwise known as that song that goes "Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah".
</li><li> "Bodies" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrowningPool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrowningPool">Drowning Pool</a> tends to get called "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff">Hilary Duff</a> never did a song called "Let the Rain Fall Down". It's "Come Clean".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> was very fond of this trope for a while.

It's clear why the song couldn't be titled "Everybody Must Get Stoned" — it would have seriously hampered distribution of anything with that song on it; it's less clear why Dylan chose this decoy title. He claimed it was for two women who wandered into the studio the day the song was recorded... or "Rainy day woman" might be a slang term for a marijuana cigarette from the '60s.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DontLookBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DontLookBack">Don't Look Back</a></em> is the Dylan documentary, the song is called "She Belongs to Me". And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong">yes, the title is ironic.</a>
</li><li> "My Back Pages" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnotherSideOfBobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnotherSideOfBobDylan">Another Side of Bob Dylan</a></em> is occasionally credited as some variation on the chorus "I Was So Much Older Then/I'm Younger Than That Now".
</li><li> "Ballad of a Thin Man" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Highway61Revisited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Highway61Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a></em> is not "that Mr Jones song".
</li><li> "Positively 4th Street" is not "You got a lotta nerve..."
</li><li> The song is "I Don't Believe You", but due to the recurring line it's often called "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)".
</li><li> In a slightly different way, most of the Dylan titles from his 1965-66 years have a -ly adverb; not only do they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non Appearing Titles</a>, it certainly looks like only the part after the adverb is the real title and the adverb is tacked on ("Positively 4th Street", "Obviously 5 Believers", "Queen Jane Approximately", "Absolutely Sweet Marie" and, probably the most blatant example, "Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)")

Perhaps you are confusing it with "Morning Train (Nine to Five)". ("9 to 5 (Morning Train)" before it was retitled for the U.S. market to avoid confusion with the similarly titled Dolly Parton song.)
</li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eels">Eels</a> tune with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jingle">Jingle-esque</a> refrain "before I sputter out" is properly called "Novocaine For The Soul" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeautifulFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeautifulFreak">Beautiful Freak</a></em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a>:
<ul><li> His breakthrough hit was not called "Slim Shady" but actually "My Name Is".
</li><li> He never had a song called "Will The Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up", it's just "The Real Slim Shady".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>'s "Come Inside", sometimes referred to as "Welcome Back My Friends", is actually entitled "Karn Evil 9: First Impression Part 2", and it's actually only the second part of a four-part song that tells the story of a world in which all decadence and sin has been banished.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnanitosVerdes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnanitosVerdes">Enanitos Verdes</a> has no song called "¡Por Favor, Déjennos Bailar!" The name of it is "Guitarras Blancas".
</li><li> The <em>English Beat</em> song "Save It For Later" is often misnamed "Sooner Or Later", as that is the first line in the chorus (Save It For Later does show up in the next line, but it's not nearly as promenant.)
</li><li> "Oy yi hi oh why yi yi", or rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Enigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Enigma">Enigma</a>'s "Return to Innocence" (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">originally</a> the Taiwanese "Jubilant Drinking Song") is best known by the parts of the song without lyrics.

<ul><li> "Sail Away" was originally titled "Orinoco Flow". The song is sometimes listed as "Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)".

<ul><li> They do not have a song titled "Take Me, I'm Yours"; that's "Breath of Life", whose title is absent from its lyrics.
</li><li> "Chorus" has sometimes been called variations on "Fishes In The Sea" or "They Covered Up The Sun", two of the more memorable lines of the refrain. There <em>is</em> a title drop near the end of the bridge ("Just a distant memory, a dawn chorus"). Additionally, a single mix of the song was officially titled "Chorus (Covered Up The Sun").
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a>:
<ul><li> "Bring Me to Life", despite being one of their most well-known songs, falls victim to this trope a lot. Even though "Bring me to life" is in the lyrics, everyone still seems to think it's "Wake Me up Inside" — including some serious academic books on pop culture.
</li><li> The song in its various demo forms was titled "Wake Me Up Inside", though.
</li><li> "Bleed" is more generally known as "I Must Be Dreaming". Admittedly, "bleed" is used only once, in the first verse.
</li><li> Weirdly, it seems "My Immortal" doesn't get confused as much, maybe because the chorus is not very giving up of an in-song title. Or because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal">the fanfiction</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitledAfterTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitledAfterTheSong">named after it.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Everclear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Everclear">Everclear</a>:
<ul><li> "Santa Monica," which does not contain the title anywhere in the lyrics, tends to be called "Watch the World Die" (the last line of the chorus) or, occasionally, "Live Beside the Ocean" (from the first line of the chorus).
</li><li> "Father of Mine" (which shows up at the beginning of the verses) is not called "Daddy Gave Me a Name" (from the chorus).
</li></ul></li><li> Everything but the Girl never recorded a song titled "And I Miss You" or "Like The Deserts Miss the Rain" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">which is often miscredited to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sade">Sade</a>). The song is actually called "Missing".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EverythingElse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EverythingElse">Everything Else</a>'s song "Everything Else" would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleOnlyChorus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleOnlyChorus">Title-Only Chorus</a> if the title of the song was "Stereotypical".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a>'s hit song is called "Epic", not "You Want It All".
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FantasyProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FantasyProject">Fantasy Project</a> song with the refrain "Stay, baby" is not the title track from the <em>Stay</em> album, but another song from that album called "Spirit"; the real title doesn't appear at all in the lyrics. Similarly, "Stay" may be mistakenly called "Don't Be Blind", since that appears in the refrain, while the title doesn't.
</li><li> The rock band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fastball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fastball">Fastball</a> has multiple examples of each type:
<ul><li> "Damaged Goods" and "Sweetwater Texas" are the more traditional types (those phrases are never uttered during the song), while "Goodbye" technically falls into this category, as only the shortened phrase 'bye' is used in the song.
</li><li> "The Malcontent (The Modern World)" and "We'll Always Have Paris (Everyday All of the Time)" fall into the "<span class="asscaps">Phrase 1</span> (<span class="asscaps">Phrase 2</span>)" category.
</li><li> "Warm Fuzzy Feeling" and "Red Light" each have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> once, during the first verses. The titular phrases are not repeated. "Mono to Stereo" is much the same, but with the title drop in the <em>second</em> verse.
</li><li> Plenty of Fastball's other songs, including their biggest hit "The Way," drop the title multiple times, but never during the refrain. Although that <em>does</em> fit this trope, it also makes the title fairly easy to pick out, as it's hard to pick out a stand-out line in the chorus (like "The Road Paved in Gold" or "They Wanted The Highway") it's usually the only phrase repeated across every verse.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a>: The majority of their songs, due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladTitle">Word Salad Title</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, to the point that the <em>exceptions</em> are noticeable on their early albums<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note41s1u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note41s1u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note41s1u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which themselves fit, as the titles of their first four albums never actually appear anywhere on the albums in question</span>:
<ul><li> <em>Take This to Your Grave</em> has two and a half songs with their own titles in the lyrics"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy Tonight" contains only the latter phrase.
</li><li> Of thirteen songs on <em>From Under the Cork Tree</em>, only two have names that actually appear in the lyrics.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5rldy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5rldy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5rldy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Dance Dance" and "Sugar, We're Going Down".</span>
</li><li> <em>Infinity on High</em> has four songs with more-or-less easily identified titles, and ten with titles that never appear in the lyrics.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6k3q2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6k3q2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6k3q2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Exceptions: "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" (though in the song, it's "<em>a goddamned</em> arms race"), "Hum Hallelujah", "Golden", and "Thnks Fr Th Mmrs". </span> "I'm Like A Lawyer With The Way I'm Always Trying To Get You Off (Me &amp; You)" is an obvious example, but none of the other nine are any easier to guess.
<ul><li> "Thnks fr th Mmrs" plays with this as the track title is "Thanks for the memories" without the vowels (apparently an inside joke when FOB was in formed that their track titles end up too long), which appears in the chorus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Folie a Deux</em> has only three songs with titles that appear, out of thirteen songs in total. And two of the exceptions could be easily misidentified; "America's Suitehearts" is sometimes thought of as "I'm In Love With My Own Sins" or the sound-alike "America's <em>Sweethearts</em>", and "What A Catch, Donnie" is mistakenly called simply "What a Catch",<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7tuiy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7tuiy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7tuiy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as the name "Donnie" never actually appears in the song</span> or "I Got Troubled Thoughts And the Self-Esteem To Match", which would fit their usual title style much better.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8jhf3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8jhf3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8jhf3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The one really straightforward exception is "I Don't Care".</span>
</li><li> Finally (mostly) Averted with their fifth and sixth albums; rumor has it that even the band themselves couldn't remember which title went to which song and it was giving them trouble in concerts. "Twin Skeleton's (Hotel in NYC)" is the one exception; "a hotel in New York City" appears repeatedly, but never "twin skeleton's" (with or without the apostrophe).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatboySlim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FatboySlim">Fatboy Slim</a>:
<ul><li> FBS has never recorded anything called "Funk Soul Brother". Or "Check It out Now". (Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">"The Funk's Your Brother", nor "The Funk's So Rubber".</a>) Try "The Rockafeller Skank". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9df0b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9df0b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9df0b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">referenced</a> in the track's intro on <em>You've Come a Long Way, Baby</em>, where a caller calls in to a radio show and, after calling Fatboy Slim "the band of the 90s... if you can call it a band, 'cause it's a one-man name", requests "the funk soul BROTHER!!" and sings the first line after the host tells him he doesn't know which one he's talking about.</span> The CD single was sold with a sticker on it saying "Check It out Now, the Funk Soul Brother" so people would know that that was the song.
<ul><li> To make things even MORE confusing, the other songs on that album have titles related to the lyrics.
</li></ul></li><li> It's "Praise You" not "I Have To Praise You Like I Should" or "I Have To Praise You Like A Shoe".
</li><li> "Star 69", another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, is not called "WTF".
</li><li> "Weapon of Choice" is an unusual example, as it's more known as the "wah-wah-wah-wah" song or the Christopher Walken song, even though the title is likely its most distinctive lyric.
<ul><li> Or, to some, it's called "You Can Deal with This, or You Can Deal with That", after the song's distinctive hook.
</li></ul></li><li> He also never composed a song called "Push the Tempo"... that's in the track called "Ya Mama" (named for the sample "shake what ya mama gave ya").
</li></ul></li><li> That Fatman Scoop track that samples Faith Evans' "Love Like This" is called "Be Faithful", not "Put Your Hands Up".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Feeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Feeder">Feeder</a>:
<ul><li> The popular song "Buck Rogers" is sometimes referred to as "Brand New Car" or even "CD Player". The title does appear in the song but only as backing vocals between the chorus and verse.
</li><li> "Just a Day" does not feature the title within the lyrics. It tends to show up on music sites with names like "All By Myself" or "I Blame Myself".
</li></ul></li><li> Fetty Wap's "679" has the title appear exactly once (in the third verse), but may be known as "Wonder When She'll Be Mine" or "Got This Sewed Up" (both lines in the chorus).
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FifthDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FifthDimension">Fifth Dimension</a> song "Wedding Bell Blues" has been called "Bill".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveForFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveForFighting">Five For Fighting</a>'s "Superman (It's Not Easy)" doesn't contain the word "Superman" anywhere (it's sung from the <em>point of view</em> of Superman). Aside from the parenthetical part of the title, common names for this include "I'm More Than a Man in a Silly Red Sheet" or "I Can't Stand to Fly".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveSecondsOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiveSecondsOfSummer">5 Seconds of Summer</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">She Looks So Perfect</a>" is often known as the "American Apparel underwear" song.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips">Flaming Lips</a> song with the chorus that goes "You're invisible now..." is called "Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin">Your</a> Invisible Now)". Yes, with that spelling mistake.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>:
<ul><li> Some people refer to "Dreams" as "Thunder". This mistake occurs less often than it ought to, since the word "dreams" is buried in the lyrics, while "thunder" is quite prominent.
</li><li> "Isn't It Midnight" is sometimes called "The Face Of A Pretty Girl" The title actually <em>does</em> appear in the refrain but isn't as prominent.
</li><li> It's just "The Chain", not "Never Break the Chain".

<ul><li> The song "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">Bowie</a>" is often referred to as "Bowie's in Space", after its first lines.
</li><li> The song officially titled "Robots" has been referred to as both "The Humans are Dead" (or just "Humans are Dead") after its chorus and "The Distant Future" after its opening line and the name of the album it appears on.
</li><li> "Pencils in the Wind" is usually called "Sellotape".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida">FloRida</a>:
<ul><li> His song with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a> innuendos is "Whistle", not "Blow My Whistle Baby".

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FourTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FourTops">Four Tops</a>:
<ul><li> "I Can't Help Myself" is also known as "Sugar Pie Honey Bunch", since that starts the song and is considerably more notable than the true title. Some cover versions use the false title.
</li><li> In addition, "Reach Out I'll Be There" contains no parentheses even though the title words are never sung consecutively. ("Reach out for me" is sung in between.) For that reason the song is often referred to as "I'll Be There".
</li></ul></li><li> You know the song "Freedom" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin">Aretha Franklin</a>? It's actually called "Think".

It's the band's first single; one presumes that they might have gotten away with just calling it "Cable Car" if they were more established.
</li><li> For instance, now that they <em>are</em> established, "Never Say Never" does not have "Don't Let Me Go" as a subtitle.
</li></ul></li><li> The Fratelli's 2006 hit is not called "Just For the Hell of It" or "Back of My Hotel" or, most commonly, the "doo-doo-doo" song. It's called "Chelsea Dagger", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">which doesn't even show up in the song</a>.

Da-Duh, Da-Duh." Interestingly, the words "rock and roll" <em>are</em> uttered somewhere in the song (some of the only real lyrics there are), but most public performances and movie/TV soundtracks cut the song down extensively, only playing the famous "grunting" chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ghost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ghost">Ghost</a>'s "I Can Feel the Thunder" doesn't exist. "Cirice", on the other hand, does. Their follow-up, "From the Pinnacle to the Pit", tends to be called "Long Way Down", "Cast out of the Heavens", or "Blackened Feathers".
</li><li> The Ghost Town DJ's have one song and it is not called "At Night I Think of You". It's called "My Boo" - the former phrase is the first line of the chorus, and the word "boo" is used two bars after and at the end of the first verse.
</li><li> Debbie Gibson does not have a song called "Never Love Again" or "Now That We're Apart." It's called "Foolish Beat." The actual title only appears once in the song.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ginuwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ginuwine">Ginuwine</a>'s 2001 hit "Differences" is better known by the name "My Whole Life" or "My Whole Life Has Changed", which comes from the first line of the chorus.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GirlsGeneration">Girls' Generation</a> do not have a song called "Bring the Boys Out". The song's title is simply "The Boys". (Also, while we're on the subject, the band's name is Girls' Generation, with a plural possessive, not Girl's Generation.)
</li><li> In response to this trope, the song titled "Dance Floor Anthem" on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte">Good Charlotte</a>'s <em>Good Morning Revival</em> album was retitled "Dance Floor Anthem (I Don't Want to Be in Love)" when it was released as a single (over time, the title and subtitle switched places, and eventually it became known only as "I Don't Want to Be in Love").
</li><li> "Without Math" was the intended title of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGoogols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGoogols">The Googols</a>' song in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV">Mathnet</a></em> installment; the record company exec changed it to the non-appearing title "Don't Leave, Just Stay, I'll Go" (because his scheme involved CDs with two commas in the titles).
</li><li> The most iconic song from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls">Goo Goo Dolls</a> is called "Iris", not "I Just Want You To Know Who I Am" or "I Don't Want The World To See Me". Though, to be fair, the title isn't mentioned anywhere in the song, nor does it have anything to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels">the movie it was written for</a>.
</li><li> Lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a>' songs are known for having a title not in the song, so a lot of songs by them are misnamed, like "Clint Eastwood" being called "Sunshine in a Bag" or "My Future is Coming On", and "19/2000" being called "Get the Cool Shoeshine".
<ul><li> "Feel Good Inc." is sometimes mistaken for "Is Everybody In?", "Windmill for the Land" or "Love is Free".
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Grace Jones</em>' signature song is often thought to be the title track off of <em>Slave To The Rhythm</em>, although this is a structurally-different version of the album's closing track, "Ladies And Gentlemen: Miss Grace Jones", which is often the version that people are looking for.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoshGracin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoshGracin">Josh Gracin</a>'s "Brass Bed" as titled on the album, was renamed "Stay With Me (Brass Bed)" upon release of the single.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead">The Grateful Dead</a>:
<ul><li> The song known as "I Will Get By" is actually titled "Touch of Grey".
</li><li> The song sometimes called "Ashes, Ashes, All Fall Down" is actually called "Throwing Stones".
</li><li> "Truckin" is better known as "What A Long Strange Trip It's Been".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>:
<ul><li> "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)": People think it's just "Time of Your Life". When it was originally released, the media sometimes referred to it as "Time Of Your Life (Good Riddance)".
</li><li> They also have "Platypus (I Hate You)".
</li><li> The chorus of a certain song by them goes "There's no one else around / when you're the last gang in town / and your heart can even break / when it doesn't even pound". Many people call it "Last Gang In Town", which was its original title. Its actual title is "Rusty James", which doesn't appear in the lyrics, but is close to the line "pocket knives and <em>rusty chains</em> / where the hell is the old gang at?"
</li><li> "Basket Case" has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, so many wrongly believe it's called "Paranoid" after the line in the chorus that goes "Am I just paranoid?"
</li><li> They also don't have any song called "All Wound Up" - try "Bab's Uvula Who?"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeGreenwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeGreenwood">Lee Greenwood</a>: The patriotic song "God Bless the U.S.A." is more often called "Proud To Be An American."
</li><li> "Electric Slide" is the name of the popular line dance that you (or more likely your parents and grandparents) dance to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarciaGriffiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarciaGriffiths">Marcia Griffiths</a>' hit single "Electric Boogie"; it is not the name of the song itself.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HaircutOneHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HaircutOneHundred">Haircut One Hundred</a> never did a song called "Boy Meets Girl". They did, however, do a song called "Favourite Shirts".
</li><li> "Ice Cream Freeze" is a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a>, but it leaked months before its release and most fans thought the title was "Let's Chill", so when it was officially released, it got the title of "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PJHarvey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PJHarvey">PJ Harvey</a>: Her song "Dry" ("you leave me dry") is not from the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dry">Dry</a></em>, but the follow-up: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RidOfMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RidOfMe">Rid of Me</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarveyDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarveyDanger">Harvey Danger</a>'s hit song, "Flagpole Sitta" apparently leads a bizarre triple life. It's often called "I'm Not Sick But I'm Not Well" because "Flagpole Sitta" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">doesn't appear in the song.</a> The closest thing to it is the line <em>I run it up the flagpole and see / who salutes, but no one ever does</em>. It's also known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s "Paranoia". This isn't caused by the existence of three differently-titled covers; there's only one recorded cover, which is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chiodos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chiodos">Chiodos</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> doesn't have a song called "Disappear in Smoke," no matter what the chorus of "Psychedelic Warlords" wants you to think.
<ul><li> The full title is "Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear in Smoke)".
</li><li> And <em>The Flying Doctor</em>, despite appearances, is not called <em>The (Drug) Cabinet Key</em>
</li><li> Likewise, "This body of mine" is actually "Brainstorm".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeadEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeadEast">Head East</a>'s '70s classic rock hit is not titled "Save My Life", "Going Down for the Last Time", or anything else found in the chorus. Rather, it's titled for the line that occurs two lines <em>before</em> the refrain: "Never Been Any Reason".
</li><li> It's called "Hide and Seek" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap">Imogen Heap</a>, not "Whatcha Say". Although there was a later song called "Whatcha Say" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDerulo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDerulo">Jason Derulo</a> that used the original song as a sample. The fact that Derulo's song became a #1 hit made things only worse for the original tune.
</li><li> The 1973 debut album by avant-garde rock pioneers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryCow">Henry Cow</a> is entitled <em>The Henry Cow Legend</em>. It has become so popular to refer to the album by the title <em>Leg End</em> — a practice that spoils the joke inherent in the cover art (the cover features an image of a sock, as did the covers to their next two albums) — that the remastered CD was actually entitled <em>LEG END: Original Mix</em>.
</li><li> "Escape" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RupertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RupertHolmes">Rupert Holmes</a> was officially retitled "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" when the record label learned that just about everyone who asked for the song in record stores referred to it as "that piña colada song".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotChocolate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotChocolate">Hot Chocolate</a>:
<ul><li> They named their song about a black woman/white man relationship "Brother Louie" (famously covered by Stories.) They probably did this to distinguish it from that <em>other</em> "Louie Louie" song. The word "brother" <em>does</em> appear once in the lyrics ("Brothers, you know what I mean.")
</li><li> "You Sexy Thing" is known by some as "I Believe in Miracles".
</li></ul></li><li> Playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a> videos after her unfortunate passing has probably led to at least one person's surprise to find out that "The Greatest Love of All", is not, in fact, called "I Believe the Children are Our Future".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BenHoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BenHoward">Ben Howard</a>'s "Fly Me to the Moon" was originally called "In Other Words" after the first line of the chorus, but eventually due to the confusion it was changed to the first line of the song, which everyone knows it as.
</li><li> The Jennifer Holliday/Jennifer Hudson song from the musical <em>Dreamgirls</em> with the lyric "I'm staying, I'm staying, and you, and you, and you... you're gonna love me." isn't called "I'm Staying" or "You're Gonna Love Me". The correct title is "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going".
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcicleWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcicleWorks">Icicle Works</a>' "Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)": the phrase "Birds fly" appears once in the second verse, while "Whisper to a scream" is the last line of the chorus. And according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords">Arista Records</a>, the subtitle apparently wasn't enough: they wouldn't put the single out in the U.S. unless it was retitled "Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)". It's been released multiple times under both "title 1 (title 2)" configurations, so <em>both</em> are correct, although technically "Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)" is supposed to refer to the mix of the song released as a single in the U.S.
</li><li> Icona Pop's biggest hit featuring Charli XCX is titled "I Love It," not "I Don't Care," which is the first shouted line of the chorus (and the line right before "I Love It").
</li><li> The Immortal's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a> for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> movie is not called "Mortal Kombat." It's "Techno-Syndrome." Although adding to the confusion is the remix featured in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">the sequel</a> which is called "Theme From Mortal Kombat (Encounter The Ultimate)."
</li><li> Influential proto-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo">Emo</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IndianSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IndianSummer">Indian Summer</a>'s most well known song has to be one of the strangest examples of this trope. It is usually referred to as "Angry Son" after the ending where the vocalist breaks down screaming "I am the angry son!" repeatedly. (<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ZSxJe2JWe70">listen here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that NONE of their songs actually had titles, and the title is just a fan creation. Despite this a live recording exists where the band can be heard before playing it saying "This one is called Woolworm" which has led many to believe that "Woolworm" is the official title. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10rh06');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10rh06" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10rh06');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As strange and confusing as this may sound, it's typical of bands of the style, many didn't given official titles to songs, but individual members would use unofficial titles or nicknames, this could've simply been one member's name for it or whatever they were calling it at the time.</span> Today it's a much less controversial issue and most agree that it is OK to refer to the song as "Angry Son" or at least "the song people call Angry Son".
</li><li> "Drive" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incubus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incubus">Incubus</a> is mistakenly-known as "Whatever Tomorrow Brings" (the first line of the chorus), "Water Over Wine" (a line from the second verse), and even "I'll Be There".
</li><li> Interface's "Outside Looking In", one of his many songs with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, is most likely to be misnamed "Where Are You Now?", after the main line of the chorus. Likewise, "It Begins Today" has a pre-chorus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>, but may be mistaken as "Time Will Wait For No One" or "Never Be The Same", the beginning and end of the chorus respectively, whilst its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a>, "Square One", has "Gaining only to lose again" and "No desire to begin again" in its refrain, but only drops it's title once.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IOSYS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IOSYS">IOSYS</a> song that repeats "Overdrive" at the start is actually called "Stops at the Affected Area and Immediately Dissolves ~Lunatic Udongein~", not "Overdrive" or "Over Drive".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>:

It's also funny how the bootleg is named "The Teenage Werewolf".
</li><li> "Purgatory" isn't called "Please, take me away", "take me away", "so far away", or any combination.
</li><li> "Drifter" can also be found online as "Gonna Sing My Song".
</li><li> "The Evil That Men Do" is not called "Livin' on a Razor's Edge".
</li><li> "Man on the Edge" isn't called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown">Falling Down</a>" (though the movie that served as inspiration is).
</li><li> They don't have a song called "Freedom", it's called "The Clansman".
</li><li> "The Wicker Man" was once called "Your Time Will Come" on a request thread. (The phrase is said <em>a lot</em>, and "Whoa-oh Oh-oh" just doesn't make for as good of a song title.)
</li><li> They also never did a song called "I'm On My Way". They did, however, do one called "Wildest Dreams".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>:
<ul><li> "Smooth Criminal" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bad">Bad</a></em> is not "Annie Are You Okay". (This applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm">Alien Ant Farm</a>'s cover, as well.)
</li><li> Even though the words do appear in the song, one could be forgiven for thinking "Blood on the Dance Floor" is called "Susie Got Your Number".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/James" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/James">James</a>' best-known song to American audiences goes "but she only comes when she's on top", but is actually called "Laid". It's not called, "You Think You're So Pretty," either.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanesAddiction">Jane's Addiction</a> song is called "Ted, Just Admit It..." not "Nothing's Shocking". It doesn't help it the album it's on is called <em>Nothing's Shocking</em>. "Sex And Violence" and "Sex Is Violent" are also common guesses — though the sorta-remix of "Ted, Just Admit It..." on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers">Natural Born Killers</a></em> soundtrack <em>is</em> called "Sex Is Violent".
</li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> song about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> isn't called "Go Ask Alice" or "Feed Your Head". It's "White Rabbit". It probably doesn't help that the "Go Ask Alice" line was used as the title for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoAskAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoAskAlice">a very popular book about drug addiction</a> and "Feed Your Head" is the title of a documentary about the Haight-Ashbury area of San Fransisco.
</li><li> "Domino", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessieJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessieJ">Jessie J</a>, is often known as "Dancing in the Moonlight" or "Dirty Dancing in the Moonlight", the first line of the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JiltedJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JiltedJohn">Jilted John</a>'s most famous song is called "Jilted John" and not "Gordon is a Moron"...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>:
<ul><li> "River of Dreams" is often referred to as "Middle of the Night". "(In the) middle of the night" is repeated throughout the song; "river of dreams" appears only once, near the end.
</li><li> Some people think the Billy Joel album <em>The Stranger</em> is called <em>Movin' Out</em>. "Movin' Out" is the first song on that album, and a catchy one. "The Stranger" is a different, quieter song on the album. The correct title of the song is "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)", a rare instance where the item in parentheses is not the lyric people think is the title.
<ul><li> Nor is it called "Heart Attack(-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack)."
</li><li> You oughta know by now.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a song on <em>The Stranger</em> called "The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie". The full Billy Joel single, however, is "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant", after the bookends; and only "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant" appears in the official album listing.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>'s hit song "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" has occasionally been referred to as "Butterflies Are Free" due to the line being used occasionally throughout the song, despite the fact that the entire last minute or so is him constantly repeating the actual title. To compound the confusion, what he actually says in the song is "some<strong>body</strong> saved my life tonight."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a> song about a Corvette is not titled "Hotter Than a Two-Dollar Pistol". It's "The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song)".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a>:
<ul><li> "Don't Stop Believin'" is often referred to as "Midnight Train" or any variant on the first line "just a small-town girl"... It's also referred to as "Streetlight People" from the refrain. Also, the song's title was originally written as "Don't Stop Believin<strong>g</strong>" on the album. Later re-releases and covers have used "Don't Stop Believin'".
</li><li> It's "Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)", not "One day, love will find you". That song's title makes it an inversion of what the title makes you expect. "Worlds apart" is heard once in a verse, "separate ways" is repeated multiple times in the chorus.
</li><li> It's "Faithfully", not "I'm Forever Yours."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a> does this a bit:
<ul><li> "Dead Souls" isn't "They Keep Calling Me".
</li><li> "Transmission" isn't "Dance To The Radio".
</li><li> "Day of the Lords" isn't "Where Will It End?"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> usually averts the trope. However:
<ul><li> It's "Deceiver", not "Forever."
</li><li> "Tyrant", not "Ev'ry Man Shall Fall."
</li><li> "Killing Machine", not "I've Got a Contract on You."
</li><li> "Rapid Fire", not "Second to None."
</li><li> "Private Property", not "Hands Off."
</li><li> "Demonizer", not "Out, Demons, Out."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas">Kansas</a></em>'s "Carry On Wayward Son" gets mislabelled as "Carry On <em>My</em> Wayward Son" so much that it even comes up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> autocomplete when searching for the song.
</li><li> Kasabian's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> is not called "Tell You I Want You", or anything else from the lyrics. Instead, it has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> "Club Foot".
</li><li> "Don't Mind" by Kent Jones is not called "The Hola Coma Esta Song" or "I Love Em' All".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Ke$ha</a> never wrote a song called "Glitter in my Eyes", "Hot and Dangerous", "Tonight We're Going Hard", or "DJ Turn it Up". The song with those phrases is called "We R Who We R". And in this case the title is actually prominent on the song, appearing "twice" on the chorus.
</li><li> "What Goes Around, Comes Around" was never released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys">Alicia Keys</a>. The song in question is called "Karma".
</li><li> Wiz Khalifa's 2015 mega-hit about Paul Walker is called "See You Again", not "It's Been a Long Day Without You".
</li><li> The Pitch Perfect song "Cups (When I'm Gone)" by Anna Kendrick is often called "The Cups Song". However, the song is not actually called "You're Going To Miss Me When I'm Gone." or "When I'm Gone."
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux_-XqB6qj8">The original is, though.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> It's easy to think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock">Kid Rock</a>'s song "American Bad Ass" is called "Cowboy", since that word is heard prominently every time the chorus is repeated. Oddly enough, there is <em>another</em> Kid Rock song with "cowboy" heard frequently therein, and that one <em>is</em> called "Cowboy." Confusing.
</li><li> There is no song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKillers">The Killers</a> titled "(I've Got) Soul but I'm Not a Soldier" or "Gotta Help Me out". The song with <em>both</em> those lines (repeated in the bridge and chorus, respectively), is named for the last line, "All These Things That I've Done".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a> has a thoroughly confusing example. On the album <em>Red</em>, there is a song entitled "Starless", which contains the phrase "Starless and Bible Black", which leads people to think that is the name of the song. It gets especially confusing because on their previous album, entitled <em>Starless and Bible Black</em>, there is a song with the same name that is simply an instrumental.
<ul><li> Slightly less confusingly, the "title song" from the album <em>In the Court of the Crimson King</em> is actually called "The Court of the Crimson King". No "in".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a>:
<ul><li> "Detroit Rock City" is an interesting case. The title is in fact well-known thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">its use</a> in the 1999 film also called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DetroitRockCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DetroitRockCity">Detroit Rock City</a></em>. However, anyone unaware of the movie and listening to the song for the first time would probably think the song was called "Get Up" or "Get Down", since those phrases are used more frequently in the chorus than "You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City" (which is uttered only once, near the beginning).
</li><li> The first track on their 1984 album <em>Animalize</em> sounds like it should be called "Into the Fire", because the chorus begins with "Out from the cold, into the fire" - and, in fact, that is the secondary, parenthesized title. But the main title is "I've Had Enough", and the track listing is "I've Had Enough (Into the Fire)". An odd case, since here the song title is taken not from the chorus, but from the very last line of each verse ("Before it's all over, it's gonna get rough / I've had enough") - though, since the chorus begins <em>immediately</em> after each verse wraps up, it can be hard to tell.
</li></ul></li><li> A well known German example (in Germany, that is): "Fahr mit mir den Fluß hinunter" by Knut Kiesewetter, which is almost always labeled as "Sie sind grün", since that part refers to the (somewhat anvilicious) message of the song.
</li><li> There's a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop">J-Pop</a> artist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiroseKohmi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiroseKohmi">Hirose Kohmi</a> whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetically mutated</a> chorus prominently features the English words "Get down!" The song is, however, called "Promise".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn">Korn</a>:
<ul><li> "Oildale (Leave Me Alone)" was first introduced to fans in concert as simply "Oildale", named after one of the areas the band members grew up in but having no relation to the lyrics. It was most likely just a working title that they never intended to use (as they've been known to do), but the fans grew attached to it, and there was backlash when there were reports that the song was going to be released as "Leave Me Alone", the most prominent line in the chorus. They eventually settled on the "<span class="asscaps">Phrase 1</span> (<span class="asscaps">Phrase 2</span>)" format as a compromise.
</li><li> "Freak On A Leash" is often known as "Something Takes A Part Of Me".
</li><li> No, "I'll Never Love Again" doesn't exist. "Never Never", however, does.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">television commercial</a> for a cover album by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CristyLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CristyLane">Cristy Lane</a> lists one of the songs on the album as "I Believe in Angels". Except that the song is actually called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">I Have a Dream</a>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZaraLarsson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZaraLarsson">Zara Larsson</a> doesn't have a song called "All Night, All Summer". She does have one called "Lush Life", however.
<ul><li> Her first hit song (and only success stateside) isn't called "Till' The Day I Die," it's called "Never Forget You".
</li></ul></li><li> That song by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedApple">Led Apple</a> that repeats "Yesterday" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> quite a lot in the lyrics is actually titled (translated from Korean) "Someone Met by Chance".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> have a few songs like this, since so many don't have the title in the lyrics at all.
<ul><li> The most obvious is "Black Dog" ("Hey hey mama said the way you move gonna make you sweat gonna make you groove...") It's named after a stray black dog that was wandering next to the studio.
</li><li> "You Don't Have to Go" is actually "D'Yer Maker" (pronounced like "Jamaica").
</li><li> They did in fact have an entire album with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTitle">No Title</a>. (variously known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinIV">Led Zeppelin IV</a></em>, <em>Four Symbols</em>, <em>Zoso</em>, etc.)
</li><li> One could be forgiven for thinking that "Fool in the Rain" is titled "The Love That I Found".
</li><li> The honky-tonkish song with the bridge that consists of "Hey Babe" over and over is called "Boogie With Stu."
</li><li> You know that catchy song from <em>Physical Graffiti</em> that sounds vaguely like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a>' "Welcome to the Jungle"? It's called "Trampled Under Foot"...but you may know it as "Talkin' 'Bout Love" or "I Can't Stop Talkin' About Love."
</li><li> A downplayed case with "Over The Hills and Far Away"; the song actually was called "Many, Many Times" originally as seen on a picture for the initial master, but the title was changed right before the album released.
</li></ul></li><li> Legião Urbana's "<a class="urllink" href="https://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Legi%C3%A3o_Urbana:Eu_Sei/en">Eu Sei<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is titled after its chorus, but is very often called by its opening words, "sexo verbal".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno">Yoko Ono</a>'s Christmas/anti-war song "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" is sometimes mislabelled as "So This Is Christmas", after the first line of the refrain.
<ul><li> You <em>can</em> catch the title of John Lennon's "Instant Karma!", as it's the first words of the song. But as it is sung rather fast, a lot of listeners pick up on the first words of the chorus instead: "And We <em>All Shine On</em>".
</li></ul></li><li> Like A Storm's 2015 hit "Become the Enemy" is often referred to as the "Jesus Christ with Devil's Horns" song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Live" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Live">Live</a>:
<ul><li> A very early song tends to be called "Give It Up" or "Let It Go" due to the words being uttered frequently during it. It's actually "Operation Spirit (Tyranny of Tradition)". Only one word of the actual title is used in the song, and it's in the first verse.
</li><li> That song that many people think is called "Lay Me Down"? It's actually called "All Over You". Both phrases appear in the chorus, but the former gets more emphasis than the latter.
</li><li> For that matter, the band's best-known song is not entitled "Oh Now Feel It Coming Back Again"; it's entitled "Lightning Crashes" (which are actually the first words in the song).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LlCoolJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LlCoolJ">Ll Cool J</a>'s big hit is not "Don't Call It a Comeback" or "I'm Gonna Knock You Out", but "Mama Said Knock You Out."
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LifeSizeHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LifeSizeHumans">Life Size Humans</a> tune that appears in the current Philadelphia Cream Cheese commercials is not called "Spread a Little Joy" <em>or</em> "Spread a Little Love". It's called "Something to Remember".
</li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a> songs, such as "Qwerty", "Figure.09", "Papercut", "Point Of Authority" and "Debris" have no mention of the title in the lyrics. Also non-appearing is "Faint," although what appears to be the word 'faint' in the chorus is actually 'feel.' In "Qwerty"'s case, many referred to the song as "Lies" before it was officially released. But the mistake isn't so justified when you accidentally call "What I've Done" "Mercy" or "In This Farewell". Or refer to "New Divide" as "Give Me Reason". Crawling is often known as "Crawling In My Skin".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lit">Lit</a>'s most well known song isn't called "Sleeping With My Clothes On" or "And You're Gone". The song you want is "My Own Worst Enemy". The former two both appear in the chorus, while the latter only appears in the second verse and the outro.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LMFAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LMFAO">LMFAO</a>'s biggest hit "Party Rock Anthem" is not called "Everyday I'm Shuffling". The words "party rock" do appear in the chorus, but no mention of an anthem anywhere.
</li><li> "Bound for the Floor" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LocalH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LocalH">Local H</a> is often referred to "Born To Be Down" or "Copacetic" — this is one of those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> examples.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LogginsAndMessina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LogginsAndMessina">Loggins And Messina</a>'s oft-covered big hit "Danny's Song" never mentions Danny and is probably best known for its "Even though we ain't got money" chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a>'s collaboration with Disclosure is known as "Magnets", not "Let's Embrace The Point of No Return".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LordsOfAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LordsOfAcid">Lords of Acid</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> isn't called "Sit On My Face" or "Fuck Me Up The". It's called "I Sit On Acid".
</li><li> Many people don't know that, as opposed to what it's called in the <em>Need For Speed Underground</em> soundtrack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lostprophets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lostprophets">Lostprophets</a>' "Ride" is actually named "To Hell We Ride".
</li><li> Remember Love and Rockets' trippy '80s love letter to '70s glam rock and heavy metal with the resounding chorus "All aboard the Express Kundalini"? Its official title is "Kundalini Express". Tricky bastards.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenLynch">Stephen Lynch</a> tune about a hideous infant is just called "Baby". Not "Ugly Baby", no matter what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> would have you believe.

<ul><li> You'd think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore">Macklemore</a>'s first hit song is named "Pop Some Tags" or perhaps "This Is Fucking Awesome" or the "Grandad's Clothes" song. It's actually titled "Thrift Shop".
<ul><li> Similarly, he never did anything called "She Keeps Me Warm", "Off-Black Cadillac" or "The City Never Looked So Bright". The first one is "Same Love" and the other two are "White Walls". That said, Mary Lambert, who sings "Same Love"'s chorus, did actually build a whole song around it called "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/NhqH-r7Xj0E">She Keeps Me Warm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness">Madness</a>'s debut single is properly called "The Prince" (which appears once, at the very end... and not at all in the version which appears on most of their hit compilations), not "Orange Street" (which appears three times). It's available on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond">One Step Beyond</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> never did a song called "Spanish Lullaby"; you're looking for "La Isla Bonita", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrueBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrueBlue">True Blue</a></em>. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">many people misattribute</a> it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan">Gloria Estefan</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManMan">Man Man</a> has "Head On (Hold On to Your Heart)". Given their fondness for unusual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">NonAppearingTitles</a>, there are probably several more cases of mistaken song identity in their discography; "Head On" just happens to be their most famous one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow">Barry Manilow</a>'s "Weekend in New England" is generally remembered by those who aren't fans of his as "When Will I Hold You Again?" It doesn't help that New England is mentioned only once in the lyrics, and the word "weekend" is never said at all.
</li><li> The song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarinaAndTheDiamonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarinaAndTheDiamonds">Marina &amp; the Diamonds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX">Charli XCX</a> is not "The Other Foot," despite the phrase repeated throughout the song, but "Just Desserts." An unnamed, unfinished version of the song that was leaked long before the song's actual release did not help.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarianasTrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarianasTrench">Marianas Trench</a> has a song with the refrain "Try a little more, little more, little more/Slap me like a bitch, and you take it like a whore/Upside-down and around and around/Just another piece till you need another sound." The song, however, is not called "Try A Little More". It's called "Shake Tramp" after a line in the second verse: "And you need that stamp, little hand<strong>shake tramp</strong>."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a> and the Wailers' "Three Little Birds" from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusBobMarleyAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusBobMarleyAlbum">Exodus</a></em> is often called "Don't Worry About a Thing" or "Every Little Thing Is Gonna Be Alright". The "three little birds" of the title technically get mentioned twice, because both verses of the song are identical, but the chorus is still what sticks in most people's minds more.
</li><li> The song "Grenade" by Bruno Mars is not actually called "Catch A Grenade".
</li><li> Looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta">The Mars Volta</a>'s "Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)"? Better search for a song called "Exo Skeleton". That isn't the line either, it's "Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MatchboxTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MatchboxTwenty">Matchbox Twenty</a> song "Real World" isn't titled "Please Don't Change" or "The Rainmaker." Especially confusing because there was a movie based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham">John Grisham</a> novel called "The Rainmaker" released just a few years before "Real World" was recorded.

<ul><li> Are you having trouble finding "Rattle My Bones"? Of course you are, because it's really "Faster".

</li><li> It's "Lez Be Friends" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMidnightBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMidnightBeast">The Midnight Beast</a>, not "She Must Be a Lesbian".
</li><li> "The Impression That I Get" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMightyMightyBosstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMightyMightyBosstones">The Mighty Mighty Bosstones</a> is sometimes mistakenly called "Never Had To Knock On Wood". Both phrases are in the chorus, it's just that the latter is the catchier part of it.
</li><li> Mineral's "Gloria" is sometimes referred to as "Mud In Your Eyes" or "Clay In Your Hands". What makes this a rather strange example is that the title does appear once near the end "Cause Gloria is silent/And glory is a silent thing"...and this is the ONLY SONG on either of their two full length albums where the title appears at all (Unless you count "The Last Word Is Rejoice", while the title does not appear in the lyrics, the final word of the song is in fact "Rejoice".)
<ul><li> Even this one sometimes gets it and is sometimes referred to as "How Can I Drink From That Stream"
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickiMinaj">Nicki Minaj</a> collaboration with Drake and Lil Wayne is not called "Thinking Out Loud". Even though that is the first thing in all three of the members' verses, it is called "Truffle Butter". Some people have suggested that the reason they did not give the song the aforementioned name was because Ed Sheeran's release was recent and a hit then.
</li><li> Happens often to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a> songs with any airplay:
<ul><li> "Better Than Today" is not called "Feel It, See It", even though the title is dropped a grand total of once.
</li><li> "Red Blooded Woman": the phrase is sung unintelligibly in the chorus and said once as background, making quite a few stations to name it "Freakin' Around".
</li><li> The duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams">Robbie Williams</a> is named "Kids" not "Jump On Board".
</li></ul></li><li> Happens with several songs from Argentine group <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Miranda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Miranda">Miranda!</a></em>. They don't have a song called "La Guitarra de Lolo"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11hts6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11hts6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11hts6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lolo's Guitar</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>:
<ul><li> Almost nobody seems to know that the oft-covered song is called "Big Yellow Taxi". Understandable, considering the phrase only appears once in the entire (quite lengthy) song, towards the end. Some people end up calling this something along the lines of "You Don't Know What You've Got 'Til It's Gone". Including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a>. Others refer to the song as "They Paved Paradise and Put Up a Parking Lot" (or just "the parking lot song"), which is the line that starts the song and ends each chorus.
</li><li> "Both Sides Now" is an inversion; it's also known as "Clouds" (the name of the CD and subject of the first verse) despite "Both Sides Now" being in all the choruses. In at least one live performance of the song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Mitchell herself</a> introduced the song saying, "Here's a song that has two titles — 'Clouds' and 'Both Sides Now' — and both are correct." So, there you have it.
<ul><li> The Joni Mitchell version is actually called "Both Sides, Now"; cover versions omit the comma (and use a tune for the chorus which is slightly, but noticeably, different from the one Mitchell wrote).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Moby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Moby">Moby</a>'s once-obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a>, later revived by a viral exercise challenge, "Flower", more widely, but wrongly, known as "Bring Sally Up". Which isn't even the title of the song "Flower" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">Sampled Up</a> — that's "<em>Green</em> Sally Up". "Bring Sally Up" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">mondegreen</a>.
</li><li> Moby Grape recorded a song called "Omaha," which is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>. This leads many to call it "Listen My Friends."
</li><li> Hardly anyone remembers <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DomenicoModugno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DomenicoModugno">Domenico Modugno</a>'s that "Volare" started out as "Nel blu dipinto di blu" (the line immediately following the "Volare, oh-oh, cantare, oh-oh-oh-oh" bit). Neither do most people know that it premiered at the 1958 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, and that it only went third on the night.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> and their members:
<ul><li> "Daydream Believer" is not called "Cheer Up, Sleepy Jean."
</li><li> The end theme of the TV series is called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">For Pete's Sake</a>", not "In This Generation".
</li><li> The opening theme of the TV series is called "(Theme from) The Monkees", not "Hey Hey, We're The Monkees!"
</li><li> Micky Dolenz wrote the song entitled "Randy Scouse Git" (or, in the U.K., "Alternative Title" as people there actually knew what the phrase meant; most people in the U.S., and Micky himself (who had heard it on a British TV show), did not). If you didn't know the title, you might be forgiven for believing the title to be "Why Don't You Cut Your Hair?" Since the show in question (<em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TillDeathDoUsPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TillDeathDoUsPart">Till Death Do Us Part</a></em>) was later adapted for American TV as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>, had Mickey been a Brit visiting the US a few years later, the title might have been "Pinko Polack Meathead".
</li><li> Oh, so very, very many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a> songs, from before, during, and after his time with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>:
<ul><li> "Papa Gene's Blues", "Nine Times Blue", "Daily Nightly", "Auntie's Municipal Court", "Tapioca Tundra", "Writing Wrongs", "Never Tell a Woman Yes", "Admiral Mike", "The Crippled Lion", "Hollywood", "Carlisle Wheeling", "Propinquity", "Some of Shelley's Blues", "Cruisin'" (a.k.a. "Lucy and Ramona")....
</li><li> At one point his record label supervisor told him to knock it off and write songs that were "just good clean fun," so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Nez wrote a song called "Good Clean Fun"</a> that still didn't have those words in the lyrics. Nez is awesome.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MonsterMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MonsterMagnet">Monster Magnet</a> song is not "Space Lord Motherfucker," it's just "Space Lord."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMontreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMontreal">Of Montreal</a>'s songs, particularly from their later albums, invoke this frequently. "Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse"? "Requiem for O.M.M. 2"? "Wraith Pinned to the Mist (and Other Games)"? None of those phrases even appear in the lyrics. Many contain words that aren't in the dictionary. Averted by their song "Coquet Coquette".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues">The Moody Blues</a>:
<ul><li> "Tuesday Afternoon" was truly and originally given the much better, more poetic and evocative title "Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)" in its original recording. Apparently misnomers became so common that it ended up causing officially released compilations to have the song be called "Tuesday Afternoon" or occasionally "Forever Afternoon".
</li><li> It's "Legend of a Mind", not "Timothy Leary" or "Timothy Leary's Dead".
</li><li> It's "Your Wildest Dreams", not "Once Upon a Time"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanisMorissette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanisMorissette">Alanis Morissette</a> didn't do a song called "Isn't It Ironic" or "It's Like Rain On Your Wedding Day" on her album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JaggedLittlePill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JaggedLittlePill">Jagged Little Pill</a></em>. It's called "Ironic".
<ul><li> Similarly, "You Owe Me Nothing In Return" from Under Rug Swept isn't called "No Strings Attached". The former line ends every chorus, the latter begins every chorus.
</li></ul></li><li> That song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> is not called "I'm In Heaven When You Smile", but "Jackie Wilson Said".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrScruff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrScruff">Mr Scruff</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> song is "Get a Move On", not "You've Got to Keep Moving".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudvayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudvayne">Mudvayne</a>'s "<em>Determined</em>" is commonly mislabeled as "Fucking Determined".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Muse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Muse">Muse</a>:
<ul><li> That song with the chorus that goes "I want it now... I want it now..." is not called that, it's called "Hysteria". "I Want It Now" is the song's subtitle in its American release. However, "I Want It Now" was the song's working title.
</li><li> The song that goes "It's a new dawn, it's a new day" is called "Feeling Good". Second of all, it's a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinaSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinaSimone">Nina Simone</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover</a>. Thirdly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone">Nina Simone</a> covered the song from a musical by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse called <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoarOfTheGreasepaintTheSmellOfTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoarOfTheGreasepaintTheSmellOfTheCrowd">The Roar Of The Greasepaint The Smell Of The Crowd</a> of which all but that song appears to have sunk without trace.
<ul><li> Well, apart from <em>A Wonderful Day Like Today</em>, covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShirleyBassey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShirleyBassey">Shirley Bassey</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LenaHorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LenaHorne">Lena Horne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SammyDavisJr">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> amongst many others. And <em>Who Can I Turn To?</em> which has been done by a whole string of performers from Astrud Gilberto through Andy Williams and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTemptations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTemptations">The Temptations</a>. But no, the show isn't often performed these days.
</li></ul></li><li> Their The Resistance single "Uprising" is not called "Victorious", (Or "We Will Not Fall", or "The Paranoia is in Bloom") as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/3226059864/m/1157076585">Entertainment Weekly Magazine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> seems to think. This mistake was caused by the last verse of the chorus being "We will be victorious", with the last word being given a very clear intonation. Also, the song's actual title is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a>:
<ul><li> It's "Helena", not "So Long and Goodnight". The latter title has been used as a subtitle, though.
</li><li> Subverted: They <em>do</em> have a song called "It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Fucking Deathwish". The confusion comes from how the song is listed on the back of the CD, which is normally censored if it contains profanity.
</li><li> "Thank You for the Venom" is not called "Give Me All Your Poison".
</li><li> "I Never Told You What I Do for a Living" is apparently sometimes referred to as "You Don't Know What I Do for a Living". This is probably more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleConfusion">Title Confusion</a>, since neither line appears in the lyrics.
</li><li> People sometimes omit the subtitle when talking about "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)".
</li><li> The amount of MCR songs from their first three albums that have the title in the song can be counted on one hand.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyFriendTheChocolateCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyFriendTheChocolateCake">My Friend The Chocolate Cake</a>'s "A Midlife's Tale" is commonly known by the refrain "(He's got to) Get it back now".
</li><li> Some of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MiyukiNakajima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MiyukiNakajima">Miyuki Nakajima</a>'s albums come with translation booklets. Normally, the title is translated directly from Japanese into English in said booklets, although some song names follow this trope. For instance, the translation of "Alone, Please" is re-titled "Leave Me Alone, Please", and the translation "Hitori de umarete kita no dakara" is re-titled "Jasmine".
</li><li> Natasha Bedingfield doesn't have a song called "Take me Away". The name of the song is "Pocketful of Sunshine".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nazareth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>'s "Hair of the Dog" is more commonly known as "Son of a Bitch", thanks to its prominent use in the chorus. The band <em>wanted</em> to name the song "Son of a Bitch" from the start, but their label wouldn't allow it. To get around this, Nazareth decided to name the song something that, phonetically, comes very close to "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Heir</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">of the Dog</a>", which is another term for...
</li><li> The band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeonTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeonTrees">Neon Trees</a> has had two big hits:
<ul><li> Their first is not called "I Want Some More", "What Are You Waiting For", "Say Goodbye to My Heart Tonight", or "Take a Bite of My Heart Tonight". It's called "Animal".
</li><li> Their second hit is not called "It Started With a Whisper" or "Everybody Talks Bad". It's just "Everybody Talks".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeYo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeYo">Ne-Yo</a> never did anything called "I Just Can't Stop". It's "Closer" you want.
</li><li> "All Downhill from Here" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewFoundGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewFoundGlory">New Found Glory</a> narrowly averted this trope. The original title was supposed to be "Catalyst" (which does appear in the refrain but is more difficult to understand than the title phrase), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">their manager</a> suggested to use the more recognizable line "All Downhill from Here" instead.
</li><li> "Political Science" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> is incorrectly known by many by its oft-repeated line "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Let's Drop the Big One Now</a>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> seems particularly fond of song titles that appear nowhere in the lyrics:
<ul><li> "Bizarre Love Triangle" is popularly known as "Every Time I See You Falling".
</li><li> "Blue Monday" isn't "How Does It Feel" (which was the title of a hit by Electroset that sampled it).
</li><li> "True Faith" isn't "I used to think that the day would never come..."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewRadicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewRadicals">New Radicals</a>' only hit song is called "You Get What You Give", not "You Got The Music In You" or "You Only Get What You Give".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OliviaNewtonJohn">Olivia Newton-John</a>:
<ul><li> Are you struggling to find a song of hers called The moon is wasting its shine (Shining on me)? Actually, the name of it is Something better to do. A strange example since even though the title phrase is mentioned thrice in the lyrics as opposed to twice for The moon is wasting its shine, the former phrase is always spoken at the <em>end</em> of each chorus while the latter is spoken at the <em>beginning</em>, which can lead uninitiated listeners to believe that the latter phrase is the songs title.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNice">The Nice</a>: An inversion, in that the album <em>Five Bridges</em> is often mistakenly given the title "Five Bridges Suite", which only refers to the long piece on side/track 1.
</li><li> Who thought that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks">Stevie Nicks</a> song "Edge of Seventeen" was named "Just Like the White Winged Dove"? Of course, the latter (often used as a subtitle) appears in the chorus, while the former, and actual title, only appears once or twice throughout the song, and only in the verses.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NightRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NightRanger">Night Ranger</a> song "Sister Christian" is not called "Motoring", or as some people believe, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">mondegreen</a> "Motorade".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Escapist" is not called "A Nightingale in a Golden Cage" or "Reality's Maze" or "Bring Me Back to Life" or any other phrase from the chorus. "Escapist" (no "the") does appear once in the lyrics, in the second verse ("This is who I am, escapist, paradise seeker").
</li><li> The first song on <em>Dark Passion Play</em> is "The Poet and the Pendulum", not "Getaway, Runaway, Fly Away" or any other line from the chorus. The actual title never appears in the lyrics — they refer to a "poet", and the title refers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePitAndThePendulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePitAndThePendulum">The Pit and the Pendulum</a>", which is also alluded to many times in the lyrics. The word "pendulum" never appears in the lyrics either, though it is alluded to with lines like "Swaying blade my lullaby" and "The blade will keep on descending".
</li><li> Despite "Those meadows of heaven" being a line in the song, "Meadows of Heaven" is a completely different song.
</li><li> <em>Imaginaerum</em>:
<ul><li> The single is titled "Storytime", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>. It might be mistakenly called "I Am the Voice of Never Never Land", which is the first line of the refrain.
</li><li> "The Crow, the Owl and the Dove" is not titled "Don't Give Me Love"
</li><li> "Song of Myself" (the penultimate song) also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, though "song of <strong>me</strong>" is mentioned in the lyrics many times.
</li><li> "Scaretale" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>, though it's hard to pick anything that WOULD be mistaken for the title of that song, since it doesn't really have a chorus or any repeating lines or phrases. It might be titled "Once Upon a Time in a Daymare" or some variation, after the first line of the song.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nile">Nile</a>:
<ul><li> There is a song called "Kafir", which is the Arabic word meaning "infidel", and while it does include the word itself, is sometimes mistakenly referred to by the main refrain of the chorus, "There Is No God".
</li><li> They have a song on the album <em>Amongst The Catacombs of Nephren-Ka</em> that includes that very phrase, but in fact is titled "Beneath Eternal Oceans of Sand".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryNilsson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryNilsson">Harry Nilsson</a>s biggest hit wasnt called Live, but Without You.(Both phrases occur in the chorus, but Live is arguably more prominent.)
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineDays">Nine Days</a>' "Absolutely" gets called "Story of a Girl" or "When She Smiles". "Story of a Girl" is the official subtitle, but people use it who ignore the main title completely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>:
<ul><li> "Closer" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDownwardSpiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDownwardSpiral">The Downward Spiral</a></em> is sometimes referred to as "Help me", the most repeated line in the song, "I wanna fuck you like an animal", the most obvious and memorable line in the chorus. "You get me closer to God" is also included. Not helped by the fact that the version that appeared on the EP <em>was</em> called Closer To God. As was the EP.
</li><li> "Wish" may be mistakenly called "The First Day of My Last Days".
</li><li> While "Closer" and "Wish" at the very least contain their titles somewhere in the lyrics, "Heresy" is most applicable to this trope as it does not contain the word anywhere in the song and often gets referred to by a line from the chorus - "god is dead".
</li><li> Piggy - prominently repeats the line <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">"nothing can stop me now"</a> at least twenty times and only utters the word "piggy" twice, in the first verse.
</li><li> "Head Like a Hole," not "Bow Down" or "The One You Serve" or "Got Money."
</li></ul></li><li> The 1975 have a song that you might think is called "Never Gonna Quit It" or "Guns Hidden Under Our Petticoats", but it's actually called "Chocolate".
</li><li> Nitty Gritty Dirt Band never recorded a song called "Coconut Grove" or the like. The song is actually called "An American Dream".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>:
<ul><li> They never did a song called "Entertain Us", nor "Waif Me". The first one's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nevermind">Nevermind</a></em> (yes, even that song is called by the wrong name sometimes), the last one is "Rape Me" but the title was altered for Walmart to sell <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InUtero">In Utero</a></em>. (A few people called "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as "Hello, Hello". But, in the defense of those few people, those are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingSomethingLeonardBernstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingSomethingLeonardBernstein">just about the only words in the song that you can actually understand.</a>)
</li><li> "Come As You Are", not "Memoria" or "Don't Have a Gun".
</li><li> "Lithium", not "I'm Not Gonna Crack", or "I'm So Happy, 'Cause Today I Found My Friends..."
</li><li> "All Apologies", not "In the Sun, Buried".
</li><li> Nirvana invokes this trope by titling a song "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" when the song is actually titled "In the Pines."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a>:
<ul><li> The hit song they recorded for the 1999 indie film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Go">Go</a></em> is not called "You're So New". It's simply called "New".
</li><li> They do not have a song called "Keep on Dancin". It's "Hella Good," which is sung in the chorus right before "Keep on Dancin'"
</li></ul></li><li> "Spiderwebs" is sometimes mistaken as "Walking in the Spiderwebs", "(I Will) Call You Back", "A Likely Story", or "Screen My Phone Calls".
</li><li> Krautrock band "Novalis" did a song which could be described as a Heavy Metal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan">Ice-Cream Koan</a> about the theme "time".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>'s "Pop" is often mislabeled "Dirty Pop", due to the frequent repetitions of the phrase throughout the song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman">Gary Numan</a>'s biggest hit was called "Cars", not "Here in My Car". And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">it is not by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars">The Cars</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a>:
<ul><li> "Come Out and Play" is often mistaken as "Keep 'Em Separated". That's its subtitle, though.
</li><li> It's called "You're Gonna Go Far, Kid", not "Right Between the Eyes" or "Hit 'Em Right Between the Eyes".
</li><li> "My Friend's Got a Girlfriend" is actually "Why Don't You Get a Job?".
</li><li> "Pretty Fly For a White Guy" might as well be called "Give It To Me Baby"; after all, that line is used about a dozen times in the song, far more than the actual title. If not that, then you might hear "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard">Gunter Glieben Glauchen Globen</a>".
</li><li> "Self-Esteem" is often known as "Laa, Laa, Laa-Laa-Laa" or "Oh, Yeah Yeah Yeah"
</li><li> Because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">misheard lyric</a>, their 2015 #1 hit "Coming for You" is often called the "Donkey Kong" song (it's "don't get caught", by the way).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMiceAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMiceAndMen">Of Mice &amp; Men</a>'s biggest hit is called "Would You Still Be There?", not "If I Could Find the Words".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMonstersAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OfMonstersAndMen">Of Monsters and Men</a>'s "Little Talks". The phrase appears once, in the middle of the second verse. It's more likely to be referred to as "Don't Listen to a Word I Say" (from the prechorus) or "Though the Truth May Vary" or "Safe to Shore" (from the chorus).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OingoBoingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OingoBoingo">Oingo Boingo</a>'s song "No One Lives Forever" is often thought to be titled "Hour of the Wolf". Seeing as the former appears in the song twice as often, the only logical explanation is "Hour of the Wolf" is just a cooler title.
<ul><li> A newcomer might think that "Dead Man's Party" is called "Leave Your Body At the Door" or "It's Only Me."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo">OK Go</a>'s "This Too Shall Pass" is not named for the more emphasized line that comes after the title in the chorus, "When the morning comes".

How bizarre, how bizarre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a>'s first big hit isn't "You Don't Know You're Beautiful". It's actually "What Makes You Beautiful". The confusion is caused by the fact that the former appears twice in the chorus and the actual title only once.
<ul><li> Zayn's solo debut is called "Pillowtalk", not "Piss off the Neighbors", "Paradise" or "War Zone".
</li></ul></li><li> "One Man Army" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OurLadyPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OurLadyPeace">Our Lady Peace</a> is commonly mistaken as "Falling" or "I Remember Falling", even though the title and the secondary titles are repeated an almost equal number of times.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a> did not have a hit called "Pretty Woman". The song you're thinking of is actually called "Oh! Pretty Woman".
<ul><li> This is invoked in a classic trivia question which catches everyone out the first time they hear it: Complete the title of the Roy Orbison hit "Pretty _____". The correct answer is "Paper".
</li></ul></li><li> "Pandora's Box" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OrchestralManoeuvresInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OrchestralManoeuvresInTheDark">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</a> isn't called "It's a Long, Long Way", although that was its subtitle in North America.
</li><li> When you heard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast">Outkast</a>'s song "Rosa Parks" for the first time on the radio, chances are you thought the song was called "Back of the Bus".

<ul><li> Many people mistake their song "Roses" as "Caroline".
</li></ul></li><li> Many people <em>do</em> know by now that the "Numa Numa" song is "Dragostea Din Tei" by O-Zone; but, for a long time, it was just "Numa Numa" or "Mai Ya Hee" to everyone. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> has kicked in so firmly on this one that for many, it may remain "Numa Numa" forever. Plus, "Numa Numa" is easier (for English-speakers) to say and people are lazy.
</li><li> "Eyes, Radio, Lies" by <em>Orgy</em> is often misnamed "Eyes in Your Radio" after the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobertPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobertPalmer">Robert Palmer</a> does not have a song called "Doctor Doctor", the song is actually called "Bad Case of Loving You", although the former has been used as a subtitle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco">Panic! at the Disco</a>:
<ul><li> Almost none the songs on their first album, <em>A Fever You Can't Sweat out</em>, have their titles in their lyrics. The titles often <em>rhyme</em> with the choruses. "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", for example, half-rhymes with the end of the chorus, "poise and rationality". Then there are titles like "There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered, Honey, You Just Haven't Figured It out Yet".
</li><li> A lot of their song titles are drawn from literature and movies, mostly for completely unrelated reasons; "Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes off" comes from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Closer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Closer">Closer</a></em>, as does "But It's Better If You Do".
</li></ul></li><li> That song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Paramore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Paramore">Paramore</a> with the hook "Badada-badada-dada!" is not "Bury the Castle". It's "Brick by Boring Brick". (And the lyric is actually "Parapa-para-pa-para".)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement">Pavement</a>:
<ul><li> "Silence Kit" is often mistakenly referred to as "Silence Kid" or "Silent Kid." These titles come from both a smudge on the back of the album that makes the "t" difficult to make out as well as the first two words of the song being "Silent kid".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a>'s waltz-tempo ballad with the refrain "Hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away" is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle">"Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town".</a>

</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelPenn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelPenn">Michael Penn</a> (Seans younger brother) did not have a late-'80s hit called "Romeo In Black Jeans" or "Someone To Dance With". The actual title, "No Myth", is dropped in the line <em>between</em> the two containing those phrases.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>' "Opportunities (Let's Make Lots Of Money)" is typically known just by the bit in brackets.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>:
<ul><li> "We Don't Need No Education", or "Leave Those Kids Alone", is actually "Another Brick in The Wall, Pt. II", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>.
</li><li> "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" isn't the intro to "Another Brick in The Wall, Pt. II", despite commonly being paired up with it.
</li><li> "Dirty Woman" is actually "Young Lust", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>.
</li><li> "Riding the Gravy Train" is actually "Have a Cigar", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a></em>.

They may have used the former title as to avoid ripping off Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Placebo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Placebo">Placebo</a>:
<ul><li> Most people refer to one song as "Every Me and Every You" because that's how the chorus seems to go. On the back of the CD case, it's called "Every You, Every Me" and if you listen to the choruse carefully, you'll hear the end of the chorus goes "every me and <em>every you, every me.</em>" Other people think it's called "Sucker Love" after the first two words of each verse.
</li><li> Few people appear to know that the song "Pure Morning" is called "Pure Morning" and not "A Friend In Need", even though the latter line is sung at the start of every verse.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Damned" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePlasmatics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePlasmatics">The Plasmatics</a> is often referred to as "Prisoners of the Damned".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RachelPlatten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RachelPlatten">Rachel Platten</a>'s 2015 smash "Fight Song" is often incorrectly called "This Is My Fight Song".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>:
<ul><li> They never did a song called "Many Miles Away." The actual title is "Synchronicity II" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Synchronicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a></em>.
</li><li> They do not have a song called "I'll Be Watching You". The actual title is "Every Breath You Take", also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Synchronicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Synchronicity">Synchronicity</a></em>. This is arguably because the Puff Daddy song that sampled it, "I'll Be Missing You," takes its title from the parallel part of the chorus. (And while we're at it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">it's not a romantic song either</a>.)
</li><li> "Message in a Bottle" from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReggattaDeBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReggattaDeBlanc">Reggatta De Blanc</a></em> is not "Sending out an SOS"; the former is the title and is in the chorus, with the latter being repeated in the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolyphonicSpree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolyphonicSpree">The Polyphonic Spree</a> apparently subscribes to the serial-number school of song titling, meaning that very nearly their entire repertoire falls under this trope. Outside of album track listings, they do refer to their songs by the subtitles; "Section 9 (Light &amp; Day/ Reach for the Sun)", for example, is just "Light &amp; Day" on the single or when Tim DeLaughter speaks in person. Also, songs that aren't on their main albums don't have section numbers ("I'm Calling" or assorted concert-only pieces). The only really tricky thing is that Sections 20 and 21 are <em>both</em> called "Together We're Heavy"; 20 is the title track for their 2nd album, while 21 is the prologue to their 3rd.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PorcupineTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PorcupineTree">Porcupine Tree</a> song "Anesthesize" is NOT "Only Apathy"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Portishead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Portishead">Portishead</a> gets this a lot as well. Off of their debut album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dummy">Dummy</a></em>, we have:
<ul><li> "Sour Times" mistaken as "Nobody Loves Me".
</li><li> "Strangers" mistaken as "Did You Realize" and "Done It Warning".
</li><li> "Glory Box" mistaken as "Give Me a Reason" and occasionally "Woman".
</li></ul></li><li> Portugal. The Man did not gain popular recognition with "Rebel Just For Kicks", "1966" or "1986". The song you're thinking of is "Feel It Still". While both lines are in the chorus, the former is much more prominent than the latter.
</li><li> "White Iverson" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PostMalone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PostMalone">Post Malone</a> isn't called "Saucin' On You". The title is referenced once in the pre-chorus, but nowhere else in the song.
</li><li> Mike Posner's 2016 comeback hit is not called "High Like Me", "Sad Songs", "All I Know Are Sad Songs" or anything like that. It's called "I Took a Pill in Ibiza", which is the very first line of the song and said nowhere else.
</li><li> The song sometimes referred to as "Please Don't Let them Hurt Your Children," is actually called "Dear Mr. Jesus" by Power Source/Sharon Batts.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pretenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pretenders">Pretenders</a>:
<ul><li> Some think "Brass in Pocket" was called "Gonna Make You Notice". It's been listed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DontForgetTheLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DontForgetTheLyrics">Dont Forget the Lyrics</a></em> as "Brass in Pocket (I'm Special)".
</li><li> There's no such song as "Ohio", or even "Back to Ohio". It's "My City Was Gone".
</li></ul></li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus">Primus</a>' earliest songs is called "The Heckler" (recorded live on <em>Suck On This</em>; a studio version wouldn't be done until 1999, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a> on <em>Antipop</em>); however, it's often referred to as the "Just A Matter Of Opinion" song.
<ul><li> It's not "The Nature Of Things"; the official name is "Glass Sandwich".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiePrinzen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiePrinzen">Die Prinzen</a>'s first hit was called "Gabi und Klaus", not "Das Leben ist grausam", the phrase that's the beginning of the chorus and was subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumTitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumTitleDrop">used as the album title</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProclaimers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProclaimers">The Proclaimers</a></em> don't have a song called "500 Miles". They do, however, have a song called "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProdigy">The Prodigy</a>: "Music Reach (1/2/3/4)"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd">Puddle of Mudd</a>'s most famous song is not called "Take It All Away". It's called "Blurry", but since the title is only the third word in the song (and only appears that one time), and the latter is the refrain, it's no wonder why "Take It All Away" is a secondary title.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>:
<ul><li> Queen did not perform a song called "We'll Keep on Trying". The song is called "Innuendo". The title <em>does</em> appear, all of once, in the song.
</li><li> They also did not perform a song called "I Want to Ride My Bicycle". That song is called "Bicycle Race", which is said several times in the bridge, but very quickly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentOnTheWrongSyllable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentOnTheWrongSyllable">weirdly stressed</a>, and once at the end.
</li><li> "You're My Best Friend" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera">A Night at the Opera</a></em> is often referred to as "Oooh, You're Making Me Live"; they're both in the refrain, but the latter is said more.
</li><li> As surprising as it may seem (being that it's easily one of their most popular songs), there are people who refer to "Bohemian Rhapsody" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera">A Night at the Opera</a></em> as either "Nothing Really Matters" and occasionally "Mama" after the only lyric repeated throughout the different parts of the song and the lyric said repeatedly in what's the closest thing to a chorus in the entire song, respectively. Of course, there's also "Galileo", "I'm Just a Poor Boy", "Can't Do This To Me Baby", etc. We would be here all day if we were to list all of the titles the song could potentially be mislabeled; alas the curse of popular music.
</li><li> Likewise, there is no song "Don't you hear me calling". It is "'39".
</li><li> An inversion/zig-zag: "We Will Rock You", one of their most famous songs, was the B-side to "We Are The Champions", and the two are almost always played together on the radio. This is also how they are arranged on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld">News of the World</a></em>, and were also typically played back-to-back in concert. This leads to some people assuming "We Are The Champions" is the title of <em>one big song</em>, and incorrectly assuming that other people are incorrectly assuming the title to the second part is "We Will Rock You"; or vice versa.
</li><li> They don't have a song called "Supersonic Man" or "Havin' a Good Time," those are lines from "Don't Stop Me Now."
</li></ul></li><li> '60s psychedelic rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service never recorded a song called "Have Another Hit". You're thinking of "Fresh Air".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">QuietRiot</a> have an interesting case. Their song "Metal Health" is often referred to as "Bang Your Head" due to the chorus repeating that line (with the second line being "Metal Health will drive you mad"). Eventually, the band simply titled the song "Bang Your Head"(Metal Health) which is how it's listed on Greatest Hits CDs and compilations.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>:
<ul><li> "Just" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBends">The Bends</a></em> is sometimes appended with "(You Do It to Yourself)". Former: 3 times. Latter: 15. Its often called this by American alternative radio disk jockeys.
</li><li> "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBends">The Bends</a></em> often gets shortened to "Fade Out".
</li><li> Their biggest hit "Creep" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PabloHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PabloHoney">Pablo Honey</a></em> often appears on filesharing sites as "So Fucking Special" after its best known lyric.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of people seem to think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a>' best-known song, "Blitzkrieg Bop" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ramones">Ramones</a></em>, is called "Hey Ho Let's Go".
</li><li> Line three/verse two of "Silhouettes" by the Rays is "Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade." The Diamonds and Herman's Hermits covered the song but changed the line to "Wondered why I'm not the guy, two silhouettes on the shade" (probably to stay uniform to verses one, three and four and because it's how many listeners heard it).
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Redgum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Redgum">Redgum</a>'s "A Walk in the Light Green" is commonly known as "I Was Only Nineteen", as the real title is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>. The cover by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerd">The Herd</a> <em>is</em> listed as "I Was Only Nineteen".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish">Reel Big Fish</a>:
<ul><li> "You Don't Know" sometimes gets referred to as some variation of "Fuck Off" or "The Fuck Off Song". It must be the profanity, because the line "You Don't Know" is said more than "Fuck Off" in the song by a good margin.
</li><li> "Cheer Up" has been called "I Got a Funny Feelin'". The words "Cheer up" only occur once, at the very end of the song.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>:
<ul><li> "By the Way" has been called "Under the Marquee", or "Standing In Line".
</li><li> "Under the Bridge" is called quite a few different things. These include "City of Angels", which occurs <em>fewer</em> times in the lyrics than the title but is enunciated more clearly. There's also "Take Me To The Place I Love."
</li><li> "Dani California" is often called "California Rest in Peace". The former is the actual title, and appears once in the second verse. The latter is the first line of the refrain.
</li><li> "Scar Tissue" is <em>not</em> called "With Birds I Share This Lonely View".
</li><li> "The Adventures of Raindance Maggie" runs into this, one could call it "Make it Rain Somehow". The titular character is referred to as Maggie only in the chorus.
</li><li> "Battleship" used to be called "Blowjob Park" but the record company made them use a non-obscene title, even though they kept the original lyrics.
</li><li> "Special Secret Song Inside" is a similar situation to "Battleship", except that it reverted to its original title "Party On Your Pussy" on the 2004 remaster of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. It is likely the band wanted it changed back out of respect to the song's late guitarist Hillel Slovak, who loved the song.
</li><li> "Otherside" (with no space) is often called "Take It On The Other Side", "The Other Side", or "Other Side". Also the opening lyrics are "How long, how long..." not "Hello, hello..." which a lot of people will think that's the title of the song.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a>'s song "Supernatural Superserious" was named by a member of Coldplay, helping it avert this trope (it was originally called "Disguise", which would have been difficult to guess from the lyrics).
<ul><li> "Losing My Religion" was frequently known as "That's me in the corner" or "Oh life", especially in areas with large religious populations where the original title might be considered blasphemy.
</li><li> "The Great Beyond" was frequently miscredited as "I'm Pushing An Elephant Up The Stairs".
</li><li> "Imitation Of Life" was known by just about every line in its chorus including "That Sugar Cane", "Come On, Come On" or "No One Can See You Cry". The actual title only appears once in the entire song.
</li><li> Also, they don't have a song called "Stand in the Place Where You Live". It's just called "Stand".
</li><li> The One I Love has been known as "This One Goes Out To The One I Love" or "Fire". The band were probably aware of the fact that people would have referred to it by the title "The One I Love" when they wrote it. Interestingly, they did title it "This One Goes Out" on a live B Side.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> has a song called "Diamonds", not "Yellow Diamonds" even though "Diamond" by itself is not heard. The song is also not called "Love In A Hopeless Place" or "We Found Love In A Hopeless Place".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst">Rise Against</a>:
<ul><li> "The Good Left Undone" is not called "All Because of You".
</li><li> Despite the heavy repeated use of the line in the bridge and near the end, "Savior" is not "I Don't Hate You".
</li><li> They don't have a song called "Don't Hold Me Up" or "I Don't Need Your Help". It's "Prayer of the Refugee" (another case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>:
<ul><li> Luckily, the band has fans who know the real titles of "Pleased to meet You," "You Make a Grown Man Cry" and "Take me down, Little Suzie." They are respectively "Sympathy for the Devil," "Start Me Up" and the less-memorable "Dead Flowers."
</li><li> They don't have a song called "I Hear Every Mother Say". That's actually "Mother's Little Helper".
</li></ul></li><li> Although you have probably heard Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars mega smash "Uptown Funk", which has since become one of the biggest songs of all time, more times than you can count, some might refer to the song as "Don't Believe Me, Just Watch", which it is not<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17p7z4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17p7z4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17p7z4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the latter appears 18 times in the song, and the former 30, although some radio edits cut some of it out to shorten it and that also appears 18 in some cases.</span>. Even then, many people are inclined to call it "Uptown Funk You Up" rather than "Uptown Funk".
</li><li> Zig-zagged to hell and back with "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)", which has been officially and unofficially referred to by three different titles derived from lyrics in the chorus. The original recording by Merry Clayton, titled "It's in His Kiss", faded into obscurity after failing to chart. The most well-known version by Betty Everett released a year later as "The Shoop Shoop Song" to avoid losing sales to Ramona King's version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks">which had released just a week prior</a>. Then it went <em>back</em> to being known as "It's In His Kiss" when Linda Lewis released her disco version in 1975; it wasn't until Cher's 1990 cover for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mermaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mermaids">Mermaids</a></em> soundtrack that the world finally settled on "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)" as the definitive way to refer to the song. That doesn't stop people from erroneously mistaking one version's name for the other, however.
</li><li> Even many die-hard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> fans will mistakenly refer to "Red Barchetta" as "Ride Like the Wind".
</li><li> Did you think <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatriceRushen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatriceRushen">Patrice Rushen</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">sole hit</a> was called "Send Me Forget Me-Nots"? Well, it's actually called "Forget Me-Nots".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a>'s novelty song "Ode To My Car", as opposed to the less album-liner-friendly "Piece of Shit Car".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Savage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Savage">Savage</a>'s "Let Me See Your Hips Swing" is actually just "Swing".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden">Savage Garden</a>:
<ul><li> "I Want You" is almost exclusively remembered as "Chica Cherry Cola" (or some spelling variant), despite the fact that "I Want You" is most of the chorus and "Chica Cherry Cola" is in the bridge once. This is likely because "Chica Cherry Cola" is distinctive, and "I Want You" is more generic. (The Savage Garden song doesn't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">"She's So Heavy"</a> section, does it?)
</li><li> It's "Affirmation", not "I Believe".
</li></ul></li><li> No, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SayAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SayAnything">Say Anything...</a> don't have a song called "Molly Connolly". They <em>do</em>, however, have a song called "Every Man Has a Molly".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeoSayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeoSayer">Leo Sayer</a>'s first hit was "Long Tall Glasses (I Can Dance)", not "I Know I Can Dance".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeyScarbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeyScarbury">Joey Scarbury</a>'s most famous song is only <em>sub</em>titled "Believe It or Not". It's more properly known as the "Theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGreatestAmericanHero">The Greatest American Hero</a></em>".
</li><li> Discussed in "If Love Is Real" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterSchickele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterSchickele">Peter Schickele</a>:
<div class="indent">This song's refrain is obviously "Oh my, oh me," <br/>And yet that's not the title of the song; <br/>The title happens to be "If Love Is Real," <br/>Which is really quite hard to believe, <br/>'Cause usually the title of the song is the refrain, you see. <br/>Oh my, oh me!
</div></li><li> That S Club (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a> at the time of recording) song is just called "Reach", not "Reach for the Stars".
<ul><li> This troper (LaptopGuy) has gone to a summer camp where "Reach" is basically the closest thing it has to a theme song. And, to pretty much the entire camp, the song is known as "Reach For The Stars." Talk about one trope affecting the population of an entire camp.
</li></ul></li><li> The techno tune with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopedLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopedLyrics">Looped Lyrics</a> "I've got the hots for you" is "Theme from S-Express" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S-Express" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S-Express">S-Express</a>.
</li><li> Robin Schulz has a song with Lilly Wood and The Prick, but it is not called "Don't Think I Will Forgive You". Or "Don't Think You Will Forgive You" or what not. It's called "Prayer In C".
<ul><li> The song he did with Mr. Probz is not called "Wave After Wave", "Drifting Away", or "Pulling Against The Stream". It's just "Waves".
</li></ul></li><li> The Script's big hit is "Breakeven," not "Falling To Pieces."
<ul><li> Also from The Script, the title of "The Man Who Can't Be Moved" (which is not, in fact, called "I'm Not Moving") never appears in the chorus- the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> occurs three times, all in quick succession during the bridge near the end of the song.

</li><li> Ed Sheeran's 2015 #2 hit is called "Thinking Out Loud", not "People Fall in Love in Mysterious Ways" or "We Found Love Right Where We Are".
<ul><li> Another Ed Sheeran song, "Shape of You", is not called "I'm In Love With The Shape of You" or "I'm In Love With Your Body".
</li></ul></li><li> Shinedown didn't record a song called "4:03". They did, however, record "If You Only Knew".
</li><li> Shiny Toy Guns:
<ul><li> "Le Disko" is not called "Supersonic Overdrive".
</li><li> "We Are Pilots", not "Who I Am".
</li><li> "When They Came for Us", not "When They Took the Beach" or "Shiny Toy Guns".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shivr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shivr">Shiv-r</a>'s song "Arise" is not called "Breathe". It doesn't help that 'arise' is only said once, while 'breathe' is basically most of the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SigueSigueSputnik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SigueSigueSputnik">Sigue Sigue Sputnik</a>'s only song of note (debateable) is called "Love Missile F1-11," not "Shoot It Up."
</li><li> "Wind Beneath My Wings" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffSilbar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffSilbar">Jeff Silbar</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LarryHenley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LarryHenley">Larry Henley</a> is often called "Hero" (or some other variation on "Did you ever know that you're my hero", the first line of the chorus).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a>:
<ul><li> "Kathy's Song" never mentions Kathy in its lyrics (though she is mentioned in a different song of theirs, "America", just to add to the confusion).
</li><li> "The 59th Street Bridge Song" is better known as "Feelin' Groovy". In listings on Simon &amp; Garfunkel CDs and the like, it's usually listed as "The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)". Covers of that song are often listed under the false title.
</li><li> That "Lie la lie - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">[BOOM!</a>] - lie la lie lie, lie la lie" song? "The Boxer". There <em>is</em> one mention of "a boxer" in the lyrics, but that's it.

Also, the song is actually an anti-drink-driving song, despite what many people on the internet will tell you — the music video makes it clear what the song's really about.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>'s "Theme From New York, New York" is often referred to as "Start Spreading the News". It didn't help that the "start spreading the news" part of the song was featured in a Philadelphia Cream Cheese commercial. Nor does it help that many people miss out the "Theme From" part, since there are other songs titled "New York, New York", the most notable one being from the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnTheTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnTheTown">On the Town</a></em>, whose film version featured Frank Sinatra. <em>That</em> song is often mistakenly called "It's a Hell of a Town", Also "Forget Domani" is often called "Let Forget About Tomorrow"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SkidRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SkidRow">Skid Row</a>'s "I Remember You" (the end of the refrain) is occasionally labeled incorrectly as "Remember Yesterday" (The start of the refrain).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmallFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmallFaces">The Small Faces</a>' lone U.S. hit was "Itchykoo Park", not "It's All Too Beautiful" (or "We'll get high," which is unsurprisingly the part most people remember, both for being a drug reference and the fact that the lead singer practically screams it).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>:

"The World is a Vampire" is quite common too.
</li><li> "Disarm" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiameseDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiameseDream">Siamese Dream</a></em>, another one of their biggest hits, gets quite commonly labelled as "(The) Killer in Me (is the Killer in You)". The title <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">dropped</a> in the first line ("Disarm you with a smile") which also has the tendency to be used as the title itself.
</li><li> No, the song is not "We Must Never Be Apart", but rather "Ava Adore" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adore">Adore</a></em>.

<ul><li> They did not do a song called "All That Glitters" or "Shooting Stars"; that's "All Star". For extra irony, most people who aren't familiar with Smash Mouth associate that song with the 2001 animated movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> (since it plays over the opening credits), even though that song was heard two years earlier over the closing credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen">Mystery Men</a></em>.

It's "How Soon Is Now?" from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatIsMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatIsMurder">Meat Is Murder</a></em>.
</li><li> If you want to find "Panic", you're better off searching for a fictional song called 'Hang The DJ'.
<ul><li> And it's just "Panic", not "Panic on the Streets of London" (or whatever place in Great Britain).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Popular DJ <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sonique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sonique">Sonique</a> never had a song called "Your Love It Feels So Good".

</li><li> The Soundtrack of Our Lives' most famous song is called "Bigtime", not "Welcome to the Future" (the title is repeated in the chorus, but is somewhat drowned out by the instrumentation, while "welcome to the future" is repeated throughout the verses, and is more clearly audible).
</li><li> The classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpiceGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpiceGirls">Spice Girls</a> song is just called "Wannabe", not "If You Wanna Be My Lover" or "I'll Tell You What I Want".

<ul><li> The song featuring the line "I've got a pocket full of kryptonite" is entitled "Jimmy Olsen's Blues." Made more confusing by being on an album called <em>Pocket Full of Kryptonite</em>.
</li><li> Biggest-ever hit for this band, same album: It's widely thought to be called "Just Go Ahead Now" or after the phrase that ends each line in the chorus. It's not called "If You Want to Call Me Baby", either. It's actually called "Two Princes", which appears in the opening line of the first verse.

Atari is frequently mentioned in the chorus, while the phrase "Japan is an island" is just sung once in the first verse. It doesn't help that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a>, or that an early version of the song that the band themselves once released as a free MP3 <em>was</em> in fact called "Atari".

</li><li> Split Enz never recorded a song called "Sometimes I Get Frightened". It's "I Got You" (the very first words uttered in the song).
</li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> song which has also been covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHollies">The Hollies</a> is not named "Sandy" but "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". The "(Sandy)" part is sometimes omitted altogether, despite being the only bit of the title that actually appears in the lyrics. <br/><br/>The Hollies compilation album <em>Epic Anthology</em> lists the title as simply "Sandy". However, the album on which their version originally appeared, <em>Another Night</em>, gets the title correct.
<ul><li> Springsteen's "America" is often mistakenly called "Coming to America"; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> movie with that title adds to the confusion. That song, of course, shares its title with the old patriotic hymn "America" - which it quotes at great length - but, ironically, <em>that</em> one gets called "My Country 'Tis of Thee."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze">Squeeze</a> have a song called "Black Coffee in Bed". Black is not added until near the end. This song might also be called "Stain on My Notebook".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillySquier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillySquier">Billy Squier</a>'s first hit is called "The Stroke," not "Stroke Me."
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveStamey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveStamey">Dave Stamey</a> song "Blackjack" is about a mule who, per the refrain, "worked in the syndicate mine."
</li><li> Edwin Starr's anti-war anthem is simply titled "War", not "War, What's It Good For?". Compare with the <em>Cannon Fodder</em> example in the Video Games section below.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a>'s song is called "Peg", not "Your Favorite Foreign Movie".
</li><li> "Mississippi Squirrel Revival" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens">Ray Stevens</a> is commonly assumed to be called "The Day the Squirrel Went Berserk", which is the first line of the chorus.
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSteveMillerBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSteveMillerBand">The Steve Miller Band</a>:
<ul><li> Inverted with "The Joker". "I'm a Joker" actually is in the refrain, but its name is often confused with "Space Cowboy", a completely different song that was being referenced in the first verse exactly one time, along with like, five others. It's not called "Midnight Toker," either. The song just has so many factors working against it, from a teenaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Homer Simpson</a> (very poorly) singing it as he drives to school in the 1970s flashback episode "The Way We Was" and being cut off long before he can get to the "Joker" part, to an indie movie in the late 1990s called <em>The Pompatus of Love</em>, which is based on one of the other monikers in the song.
</li><li> There is a song named "Fly Like an Eagle", not "Time Keeps on Slippin'" (both are said often).
</li></ul></li><li> Rod Stewart: "Young Hearts, be free tonight..." for whatever reason is named "Young Turks".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18nl6c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18nl6c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18nl6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks">Where that phrase comes from<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>
<ul><li> Also, Rod has never had a song called "I Wish That I Knew What I Know Now" or any variation of that. The song featuring the chorus repeating "I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger" is called "Ooh La La".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneSour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneSour">Stone Sour</a>'s hit song "Tired" is not called "Too Young to Care".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a> is infamous for this trope. Many of their songs like "Plush" and "Big Empty" don't have anything remotely close to the title anywhere in the lyrics. And then you have songs like "Sour Girl" (sometimes mistakenly called "What Would You Do") and "Creep" (AKA "Half the Man I Used to Be"), which <em>do</em> have the title in the lyrics, but only once or twice in on of the verses, not in the refrain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>'s "Love Without End, Amen" is often mistakenly referred to as "A Father's Love".

<ul><li> "88" (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>) is not called "I Feel Like a Prisoner", "I Hope Someday You Have It All" or any other phrase that appears in the refrain.
</li><li> It's "Fat Lip", not "Waste My Time" or "El Nino" or "Don't Count on Me" or "Should've Had an Abortion".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunnyDayRealEstate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunnyDayRealEstate">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>'s signature song is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">"Seven"</a>, not "You'll Taste It" or "You'll Taste It In Time."
</li><li> You know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuperJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuperJunior">Super Junior</a> song that everyone thinks is called "Bonamana"? That's only the subtitle. The official title is "Beauty (BONAMANA)", with the "BONAMANA" written in capitals (and in English letters, while the "Beauty" part is written in Hangul, in Korean). Since most people outside of Korea can't read Hangul, they just refer to the song as the part they can read.
</li><li> The title of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp">Supertramp</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BreakfastInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BreakfastInAmerica">Breakfast In America</a></em> never appears in that specific form in the lyrics. Most people seem to think the title is "Take a Look at My Girlfriend". <br/><br/>The very same wrong title is often mistakenly given to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymClassHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymClassHeroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>' popular single "Cupid's Chokehold", where the Supertramp song's first few lines are sung as a chorus by Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes">The Supremes</a> have sung the words "I was bitten by the love bug," the title is "Love is Like an Itching In My Heart."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> also has a few other examples despite the fact that every single of her commercially released songs feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>.
<ul><li> The song with the goat screams remix? That's not 'Trouble', but "I Knew You Were Trouble" - also not 'I Knew You Were Trouble When You Walked In'.
</li><li> She has no song called 'Cory's Song', 'Cory's Eyes', 'You're Beautiful', it's actually called "Stay Beautiful".
<ul><li> It's also not "Beautiful Eyes", a different Swift song.
</li></ul></li><li> 'Love Song' is by Sara Bareilles, Swift's biggest hit is "Love Story" (also not 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' or any variation thereof).
</li><li> "New Romantics" is not called 'The Best People In Life Are Free'.
</li><li> Played with in that she has several songs about staying. They are called "All You Had To Do Was Stay" and "Stay Stay Stay", neither are 'Stay'.
<ul><li> "Breathe" and "Clean" are both different but similar Taylor Swift songs, one from <em>"Fearless"</em> and one from <em>"1989"</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Mary's Song (Oh My, my, my)" is, when not forgotten, sometimes called 'My my my my my' or 'Stars that Shine'.
</li><li> "How You Get The Girl" isn't called 'That's How It Works', 'How You Lost The Girl', etc.
</li><li> "I Know Places" isn't called anything to do with foxes, hunters, or running (They are the hunters we are the foxes/And we run/Ba-by, I know places we won't be found/And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down/Cause I, I know places we can hide).
</li><li> "Blank Space" is <em>not</em> 'Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream' or '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Starbucks lovers</a>'.
<ul><li> "Shake It Off" isn't 'Haters gonna hate', despite the internet's best intentions of renaming it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SystemOfADown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SystemOfADown">System of a Down</a> has this problem with several of their songs, since a lot of them are named different then the prominent lyrics (and a lot of the verses are hard to understand).
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">At no time are the words "chop suey" ever mentioned</a> in "Chop Suey", which may well explain why it's been called "When Angels Deserve to Die". Those words are the last line of the refrain, though; and it seems to be part of the central meaning to the song's lyrics. Also there's "Wake Up!", "I Don't Think You Trust," and "Self-Righteous Suicide" for that song. The working title was "Suicide", hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">the engineer saying "We're rolling 'Suicide'"</a> at the start of the recording. Still, it isn't "Self-Righteous Suicide".
</li><li> Even though the words "toxicity" appears in the song "Toxicity", common mislabels for it include "Disorder" and "What, Do You Own The World?".
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a> song "Once in a Lifetime" is not called "Letting the Days Go By" or "Same as It Ever Was". The line "Once in a lifetime" is said once at the end of the chorus, the other two are repeated over and over.
<ul><li> "Life During Wartime" is not "This Ain't No Party, This Ain't No Disco, This Ain't No Fooling Around" or any variation of that. It isn't even "I Ain't Got Time for That Now" (the line that ends each chorus).
</li></ul></li><li> A bizarre inversion: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TallyHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TallyHall">Tally Hall</a>'s song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> is often referred to as "Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf". This comes from a lyric sung exactly once in the song. The actual title is simply "Shia LaBeouf", which <em>is</em> the refrain.
</li><li> That <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TempleOfTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TempleOfTheDog">Temple Of The Dog</a> song that goes "I'm going hungry" is actually called "Hunger Strike".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Msic/JanTerri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Msic/JanTerri">Jan Terri</a>'s "Losing You" is not called "Lose You Tonight".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a>:
<ul><li> "The Guitar" is often mistaken as "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" for its sampling of that song. They were required to use "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" as a subtitle though, as it is more or less the same song but with different lyrics.
<ul><li> They never did a song called "I'm Insane", it's "Absolutely Bill's Mood". The title refers to their first producer, Bill Krauss, and the title is meant to mock the above-mentioned Bob Dylan titling scheme.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirdEyeBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirdEyeBlind">Third Eye Blind</a>
<ul><li> They never did a song called "I Want Something Else". It's really "Semi-Charmed Life" - which itself is confusing, because "semi-charmed life" isn't exactly what's in the lyrics, but rather "semi-charmed <em>kind of</em> life." (Another candidate for the title was "Doot-Doot-Doot, Doot-Doot-Doot-Doo", because those were the lyrics people most remembered.)
</li><li> "Can You Put the Past Away?" is really called "Jumper". It's not called "I Will Understand," either.
</li><li> Their final hit was "Never Let You Go", <em>not</em> "Turn Around".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirtySecondsToMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirtySecondsToMars">30 Seconds to Mars</a>:
<ul><li> That song is not called "This is a Fight to the Death" or "Rise Again" or "Say a Prayer". It's called "Conquistador".
</li><li> You know "I'll Attack"? It's actually just called "Attack".
</li></ul></li><li> For all the Canadians out there, "Ontario Sucks" is actually called "The Toronto Song." And it wasn't recorded by the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArrogantWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArrogantWorms">Arrogant Worms</a> either, it's actually by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDeadTrollsInABaggie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDeadTrollsInABaggie">Three Dead Trolls In A Baggie</a>. Which makes sense anyway, seeing how the Arrogant Worms are from Kingston, ON, not Alberta.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDogNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDogNight">Three Dog Night</a>:
<ul><li> There is no such song as "Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog". It's called "Joy to the World". Yes, the same title as the Christmas carol. (The confusion isn't helped by the fact that the chorus has ended up in several cover versions of that Christmas carol...)
</li><li> They never did a song called "How Does Your Light Shine". It's called "Shambala".
</li><li> "Black and White" is usually referred to as something along the lines of "A Child Is Black, a Child Is White". The words "black" and "white" appear constantly throughout the song, but "black and white" never appears as an unbroken phrase.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDoorsDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeDoorsDown">3 Doors Down</a>'s most famous song is not called "Superman," nor is it called "If I Go Crazy." It's actually called "Kryptonite".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF">The Timelords</a>' 1988 UK number one "Doctorin' The Tardis" was titled as an incredibly lame pun on a then-recent hit single "Doctorin' The House", but is otherwise known simply as "Doctor Who". The creators even lampshaded this in their book <em>The Manual</em>, saying that they should have <em>realised</em> people would just call it "Doctor Who" and that the obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> was needlessly confusing and probably cost them sales.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tism">Tism</a> have a tune called "(He'll never be an) Ol' Man River" as opposed to some variation on "The Drug", "I'm on the Drug" or "I'm on the drug that killed River Phoenix." It is debateable whether the actual title makes the song any more or less tasteless.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toadies">Toadies</a>' "Possum Kingdom", which doesn't contain the title phrase anywhere in the song, tends to get called "So Help Me Jesus" for the last line of the chorus, or less often "Do You Wanna Die?" for the bridge. Other common titles include "Make Up Your Mind" or "Be My Angel".
</li><li> Though it's tempting to think otherwise, Tommy Tutone's 1982 one-hit wonder is called "867-5309/Jenny", not simply "867-5309."
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelTorme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelTorme">Mel Torme</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobWells">Bob Wells</a>' soothing, mellow Christmas song that everyone knows as "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" is actually titled, simply, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSomethingSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSomethingSong">"The Christmas Song."</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">Pirate</a> (subverted at the end) theme song "Unter falscher Flagge" (beginning of the 2nd verse) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DieTotenHosen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DieTotenHosen">Die Toten Hosen</a> is not called "Schnapsinsel" (the refrain).
</li><li> "Hold the Line" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Toto">Toto</a> is often called "Love Isn't Always on Time".
</li><li> Remember the "Lemming Show" (and watch them suicide) by Frank Tovey (Fad Gadget)? Sorry, but that song is named "Bridge St. Shuffle".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToyBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToyBox">Toy Box</a>'s song about Tarzan is called "Tarzan &amp; Jane", not "Tarzan" or "The Jungle Song" or "Ride an Elephant".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Train" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Train">Train</a>:
<ul><li> There is no Train song called "I'm All out of Lies" or "Ways to Say You Died". It's "50 Ways to Say Goodbye", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>.
</li><li> They did not record "Tell Me". It's called "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)".
</li><li> Their first hit? "Meet Virginia", not "She Wants to Be the Queen" or "I Don't Really Wanna be the Queen"
</li></ul></li><li> The Trammps' most famous song is called "Disco Inferno," not "Burn Baby Burn" (which is the line right before "Disco Inferno")
</li><li> Trick Pony's second single included the lyric "that's just what you/I need" in both verses, and at the start and end of the chorus. So of course it was titled "On a Night Like This".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain">Shania Twain</a> invoked this trope with "Love Gets Me Every Time". The song was originally titled "Gol Darn Gone and Done It", and that line is more prominent in the song, but she changed it at the last minute because she thought the original title would be too hard to pronounce.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOnePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOnePilots">Twenty One Pilots</a>' biggest hit is not called "Blurryface", but "Stressed Out" — although <em>Blurryface</em> is the name of its parent album.
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTubes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTubes">The Tubes</a>' biggest hit was not called "Don't Fall in Love" nor "One in a Million Girls". The song's title is "She's a Beauty".
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonnieTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonnieTyler">Bonnie Tyler</a>:
<ul><li> The song that goes "turn around... {lyrics lyrics}, turn around... {lyrics lyrics}, turn around, bright eyes... {lyrics lyrics}, turn around..." and on and on like this is called "Total Eclipse of the Heart". (Not "I Need You More Than Ever" or "Forever's Gonna Start Tonight", either) Though this is at least guessable, being the punch line of the refrain.
</li><li> Her other big hit is not called "I Need a Hero". It's called "Holding Out for a Hero".
</li></ul></li><li> Brooklyn based doom / gloom / goth / sludge metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TypeONegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TypeONegative">Type O Negative</a>'s faux-live album <em>The Origin of the Feces</em> plays with this trope by naming the songs as if they were from a bootleg. Most of the titles are the first line of the chorus or the most repeated word: "Gravitational Constant: G = 6.67 x 10-8 cm-3 gm-1 sec-2" becomes "Gravity" and "Unsuccessfully Coping with the Natural Beauty of Infidelity" is retitled "I Know You're Fucking Someone Else."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a> song "Pride (In the Name of Love)" (just "Pride" on some pressings of <em>The Unforgettable Fire</em>) is more referred to by the part in parentheses.
<ul><li> Their breakout hit in 1985 was a live performance of "Bad" at Live Aid. If you don't recognize the title, you probably think the song is called something like "Let it go" or "I'm wide awake" from the song's refrain.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox">Ultravox</a> avoid this trope on their two biggest hits ("Vienna" and "Dancing With Tears in My Eyes"), their <em>third</em>-biggest hit, "Hymn", has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> and can lead to it being called any number of lines from the chorus, mostly because it can and will get stuck in your brain:
<div class="indent">"Give us this day all that you've shown me,
</div><div class="indent">The power and the glory, 'til my kingdom come
</div><div class="indent">Give me all the story book told me
</div><div class="indent">The faith and the glory, 'til my kingdom come..."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheUsed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheUsed">The Used</a> don't have a song titled "I'll Be Just Fine Pretending I'm Not". Its actually titled "All That I've Got", which comes after the chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher">Usher</a> and wil.i.am's famous song is not "Oh My Gosh" but simply "OMG".

His viral hit is called "The 7th Element", not "Chum Drum Bedrum", "Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah", or "Blblblblbl".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RufusWainwright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RufusWainwright">Rufus Wainwright</a>'s "Greek Song" is sometimes referred to as "You Turn Me On" after the phrase repeated seven times in the first verse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits">Tom Waits</a>' "Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmallChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmallChange">Small Change</a></em> is often erroneously called "Waltzing Matilda" because it uses that song as its chorus. Waits is fond of concept albums, and the title only makes sense in that context; it's just never explained in the song itself. Most of the songs on that album also have alternate or expanded titles in parentheses.
</li><li> Alan Walker's hit is not called "Where Are You Now", but "Faded" (most likely to avoid confusion with the Jack U/Justin Bieber hit "Where Are <em>U</em> Now").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWeeknd">The Weeknd</a> does not have a song called "Half Past Five" or "The Real Me". It's called "The Hills".

(And, more ridiculously, that phrase comes from the first verse, not the refrain, which starts: "Oh, moon of Alabama...")
</li><li> This is true of several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s parodies. In general, whenever the phrase he replaces the original song's namesake with doesn't make for a good title, it probably isn't.
<ul><li> His parody of "Eye of the Tiger" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Survivor">Survivor</a> (a major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII">Rocky III</a></em>) is called "Theme from Rocky XIII (The Rye or the Kaiser)", not simply "Rye or the Kaiser". On the album cover, the part in parentheses doesn't even appear.
</li><li> "The Plumbing Song", combined parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilliVanilli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilliVanilli">Milli Vanilli</a>'s hit singles "Baby Don't Forget My Number" and "Blame It on the Rain", is sometimes known as "Baby Don't Forget My Plumber" and/or "Blame It on the Drain".

</li><li> His parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrashTestDummies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CrashTestDummies">Crash Test Dummies</a>' "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" has the same mmm's in the chorus as the original, but is listed as "Headline News".
</li><li> "Cavity Search" has been misnamed as "Numb Me, Drill Me, Floss Me, Bill Me", being a dentistry-themed parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>'s "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me".
</li><li> Al's second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-themed parody is "The Saga Begins", not "My, My, This Here Anakin Guy".
</li><li> <em>Poodle Hat</em> is noteworthy for having not even one parody where the title is a perfect substitute for the original's. His parody of "Complicated" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne">Avril Lavigne</a> is not called "Constipated", "Related", or "Decapitated", with which Al replaces the word "complicated" in the first, second, and third verses, respectively; it's called "A Complicated Song". Rumor has it that the three verses are actually the beginnings of three different attempts at a parody of "Complicated" that were loosely tied together into a single song. His song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a>, sung to the tune of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">"Piano Man"</a>, is called "Ode to a Superhero" for legal reasons. "Couch Potato" was a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a>'s "Lose Yourself" (the title line of which was "lose your mind", which would be misleading out of context). "Trash Day" parodied Nelly's "Hot in Here" ("it's getting hot in here" became "there's something rotten here", among other things), but the title phrase does at least appear in the first line. Finally, his parody of the Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way" is simply called "eBay", not "What I Bought on eBay".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> doesn't have a song called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a>". It's called "Diamonds from Sierra Leone". Granted, the song <em>did</em> famously sample the theme of the same name from the film, and the original title of the song <em>was</em> "Diamonds Are Forever".
<ul><li> He also never did anything called "Ball So Hard" or "That Shit Cray". It's "Niggas in Paris" you want.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWest">Keith West</a>'s "Excerpt from a Teenage Opera" is often called "Grocer Jack". On the <em>Teenage Opera</em> CD (released many years later), it's called "Grocer Jack: Excerpt from a Teenage Opera".

And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithWhitley">Keith Whitley</a>, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKrauss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKrauss">Alison Krauss</a> or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonanKeating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonanKeating">Ronan Keating</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">sang it first.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>'s biggest hit is "Here I Go Again", not "Here I Go Again On My Own". Also, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> soundalike song is not called "In The Still Of The Night", but just "Still Of The Night".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext">"Baba O'Riley"</a> is more commonly known as "Teenage Wasteland". Some even call it "Out Here In The Field" after the first line. iTunes actually calls it "Teenage Wasteland" as well, which is misleading, to say the least. "Baba O'Riley" does recycle some lyrics from an earlier song legitimately called "Teenage Wasteland", but that one only exists as a Pete Townshend demo and was never recorded by The Who.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em> references this confusion. When the main character calls it "Teenage Wasteland", her friend gets annoyed and corrects her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NeverMindTheBuzzcocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NeverMindTheBuzzcocks">Never Mind the Buzzcocks</a></em> had a subtle nod to this as well during an Intros Round for one episode. Rufus Hound recognized it almost immediately when fellow panelists Phill Jupitus and James Blunt sang the opening riff, and even sang along at one point:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Rufus</strong>: "Don't cry / Don't raise your eye / It's only teenage wasteland

After hearing the song for the first time, Joe calls the radio station to find out the name of the song, and the DJ mentions that the song is called "Baba O'Riley", even though they say "Teenage Wasteland" a million times and "Baba O'Riley" zero times.
</li><li> It's only one letter out, but that <em>other</em> synth-heavy rock anthem from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhosNext">Who's Next</a></em> is "Won't Get Fooled Again", not "Don't Get Fooled Again", even though the latter is what they actually sing. And it's not called "Meet the New Boss", either.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder">Stevie Wonder</a>'s classic song isn't called "You Can Feel It All Over" (which is basically the entire chorus); it's "Sir Duke" (which appears exactly once) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsInTheKeyOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsInTheKeyOfLife">Songs in the Key of Life</a></em>.
</li><li> "Bad Connection" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo">Yazoo</a> is not "Can You Hear Me". The real title is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>.
<ul><li> Also, you won't find a song called "Move Out". It's "Situation".
</li></ul></li><li> A radio station once made a pre-song sweeper of a listener calling in to ask "Who sings that new song, American Girl?" to which the DJ responded "Well nobody, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrishaYearwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrishaYearwood">Trisha Yearwood</a> sings X's and O's." "X's and O's" is the second half of the second line of the chorus, while "She's an American Girl" is the last two repeated lines of every chorus... But, "X's and O's" gets repeated about 4 times at the <em>very end</em> of the song. And just to confuse things further, the song's official title is "XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)". Yes, three X's and three O's.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YeahYeahYeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> 's 2003 song with Karen O crying while performing? It's called "Maps", not "They Don't Love You Like I Love You".
</li><li> The name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis">Ylvis</a>'s viral hit is not "What Does the Fox Say?". At first, it was just called "The Fox," but confusion was so common that "What Does the Fox Say?" was eventually added as a subtitle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> has an anthemic song about dying early, from his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RustNeverSleeps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RustNeverSleeps">Rust Never Sleeps</a></em> album. Most people would guess that the song is called "Look Out Mama" or something similar (the song has no particular chorus, and begins thusly: "Look out, mama, there's a white boat comin' up the river...") when, in actuality, it's called "Powderfinger". This phrase doesn't appear in the lyrics — however, the last verse, sung after the character's rifle has backfired and killed him, begins: "Shelter me from the powder and the finger". This is in reference to the gunpowder and the finger that pulled the trigger. Probably.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>:
<ul><li> Zappa's "Absolutely Free" is not a song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbsolutelyFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbsolutelyFree">Absolutely Free</a></em>, but his next album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney">We're Only in It for the Money</a></em>.

Nevertheless everybody calls it "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zeromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Zeromancer">Zeromancer</a>'s "Dr. Online" is known as "1-800-suicide", after the lyic that starts the chorus, "Doctor Online" appears in the next line, but it's not as prominent. The fact that there's a famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> fanvid called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">1-800-Kirbycide</a>" doesn't help. There also is a completely different song called 1-800-suicide by Gravediggaz ("Suicide, it's a suicide").
</li><li> "Kernkraft 400" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZombieNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZombieNation">Zombie Nation</a>. Most people think "Zombie Nation" is the name of the song because it's mentioned in the song and the title is not. Being listed as "Zombie Nation" on several compilations doesn't help matters. Neither is the true title looking foreign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers">Manic Street Preachers</a></em> have a song actually called "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next". Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle">Long Title</a>, most refer to it as "Tolerate" or "Your Children Will Be Next" or any other phrase from the title. Not to mention that the lyrics say "If you tolerate this <strong>then</strong> your children will be next", causing further confusion.

<ul><li> The song "Twist and Shout" is an interesting combination of both this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a>. It was originally titled "Shake It Up, Baby" (or "Shake It Up, Babe") and recorded by a rather unknown band called <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopNotes">Top Notes</a> (or The Topnotes or Topnotes or The Top Notes, they weren't too sure on how they wanted their name to be spelled). After their version of the song failed to be a hit, the original writer of the song gave the lyrics to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers">The Isley Brothers</a>, who recorded the first popular version of the song as "Twist and Shout". Later on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> recorded a cover of the song on their debut album <em>Please Please Me</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> on vocals, which many believe is their original.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: It's not "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory" or "Glory, Glory, Hallelujah" or "that song mentioning the Grapes of Wrath". The actual title of the song is "Battle Hymn of the Republic" (and its tune is borrowed from the Civil War-era folk song "John Brown's Body"). It's not helped that many hymnals list it with different titles.
<ul><li> The hymnals thing stems from the same problem as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> examples below: many hymnals list their songs based on the first line of the song, no matter what the actual title or refrain may be.
</li></ul></li><li> The American patriotic song with the first line is "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" is actually titled "America" and the theme is adapted from the British national anthem "God Save the Queen".
<ul><li> Similarly, it's "Land of Hope and Glory", not "The Graduation Song". Like the above example, it's actually a British patriotic song; it just ended up being used by American and Canadian high schools, colleges and universities as graduation ceremony music.
</li></ul></li><li> The Philippine national anthem is NOT titled "Bayang Magiliw" ("Beloved Country"). It's called "Lupang Hinirang" ("Chosen Land").
</li><li> Three's a Catholic hymn that says "We shall be changed" numerous times throughout, including twice in the chorus alone. The song is actually called "On the Wings of Change", which is never actually said anywhere in the lyrics themselves.
</li><li> Here's a strange one: the classic tune so often referred to as "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by Mozart actually goes by the official and less memorable name of "Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, K. 525" (or just "Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major".) The title also properly translates to "A Little Serenade", not "A Little Night Music".
</li><li> Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" is properly called "Symphony No. 9 in D minor" (and "Ode to Joy" is only the <em>final movement</em> of said piece)
</li><li> "Für Elise"'s official title is "Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor for solo piano". It's no wonder people use the shorter titles to refer to these pieces...
</li><li> The one exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Bach's</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToccataAndFugueInDMinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToccataAndFugueInDMinor">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a>", which despite being a fairly well-known tune (being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a>) doesn't go by any other name than that.
</li><li> Stephen Foster didn't write a song called "(Way Down Upon the) Swanee River". He did, however, write one called "Old Folks at Home". Part of the problem is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeGershwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeGershwin">George Gershwin</a> came up with a tune inspired by its lyrics called "Swanee." "Alexander's Ragtime Band" also has "Swanee" mentioned as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Foster's tune.
</li><li> The calypso tune popularly known as "Day-O" is more properly called "The Banana Boat Song". Also, one of its earliest arrangements was done by a calypso group fronted by future Academy Award-winning actor Alan Arkin. "6 Foot 7 Foot" also became a common mistake thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilWayne">Lil Wayne</a>.
</li><li> The song "Beer Barrel Polka" (by Jaromír Vejvoda) is usually called "Roll out the Barrel."
</li><li> The popular children's song about fruit and vegetables isn't called "Cauliflowers Fluffy". It's called "Paintbox" and the title doesn't appear anywhere in the song.
<ul><li> Another children's song example: It's "Autumn Days" not "I Mustn't Forget".
</li></ul></li><li> "Das Deutschlandlied", the (former) German national anthem, often mistakenly referred to by its opening line, "Deutschland Über Alles". The official anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is only the third stanza of the former anthem, is still called "Das Deutschlandlied" or "Das Lied der Deutschen" and not "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit".
</li><li> The University of Nebraska's fight song is frequently called "There is No Place Like Nebraska", but the actual title is "Dear Old Nebraska U".
</li><li> Similarly, the "Notre Dame Victory March" (famously used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em>) is often mistakenly called either "Wake Up the Echoes" or "Cheer, Cheer For Old Notre Dame."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">infamously memetic song</a> that lodged "All your base are belong to us" into the minds of so many is titled "Invasion of the Gabber Robots". The Laziest Men on Mars used to distribute a version of the song that was tagged "Invasion of the Gabber Robots (all your <em>bass</em> are belong to us)" back when MP3.com actually sold MP3s.
</li><li> "Zadok the Priest", sung at British coronations, was often called "God Save The King" after its chorus — until <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_The_King">the song now known by that name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> became popular in the 1740s.
</li><li> That ragtime/jazz duet that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BingCrosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BingCrosby">Bing Crosby</a> did with his son Gary was called "Play a Simple Melody", not "Play Me Some Rag" or "I Wanna Listen to Rag."
</li><li> To take another famous neo-ragtime song, Teresa Brewer's biggest hit was "Music! Music! Music!" - even though it's more popularly known as "Put Another Nickel In, In the Nickelodeon."
</li><li> The Christmas carol with the refrain "O tidings of comfort and joy" is called "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen".
</li><li> Speaking of Christian music, a lot of hymns mistakenly get misnamed based on their refrain as opposed to their first line (which is the far more common nomenclature); for example, "Come Ye Sinners Poor and Needy" is frequently misnamed "I Will Arise".
</li><li> The World War II era <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> (most famously covered by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAndrewSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAndrewSisters">The Andrew Sisters</a> in 1945) with the refrain "Working For The Yankee Dollar" is actually called "Rum And Coca-Cola".
</li><li> The song often known by its opening line "Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire" actually has the rather generic title "The Christmas Song".

<ul><li> The first opening theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar">Hokuto no Ken</a></em> by Crystal King is often referred to as "You wa Shock," as that line comes up quite a bit in the lyrics. It's actually titled "Ai o Torimodose," a line which appears far fewer times (twice in the album version, only once in the TV edit).
<ul><li> DGM's cover of "Ai o Torimodose!" is actually titled in the album as "You Wa Shock! (Ai o Torimodose)".
<ul><li> Many bands that cover this song tend to title it like that or as "Ai o Torimodose (You Wa Shock!)".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A similar case is the fourth and arguably most famous opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>.

(punctuation included), which is said <em>once</em> in the entire song (after the part with "Don't forget your first impulse ever" and "Let's keep your adventurous ever"). It does sound like it's said in the chorus, but that lyric is actually "Burn!"
<ul><li> The first opening of Naruto Shippūden is called "Hero's Come Back!!" by nobodyknows+, though sometimes you will also find it under the title "Speed Hunter".
<ul><li> The fifth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a> Shippuden opening, "Hotaru no Hikari" (Light of the Fireflies), is often incorrectly called "Sha la la".

We Kick Reason to the Curb to Make the Impossible Possible! Open up Your Ears and Listen to Our Team Dai-Gurren Theme!!</a> in English.
<ul><li> Actually there are at least three other songs that use the same lyrics as a part of them; the distinctive segment's name is presumably called "Rap is a Man's Soul!" as that appears in the title of three of the four songs. The fourth, which juxtaposes the rapping with opera, is named "'Libera me' from Hell."
</li></ul></li><li> A certain <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em> ending song is sometimes referred to as "Glory Days," due to this being the last two words of the chorus as well as one of the only English phrases in the song. The title is actually "White Line" (with this phrase only appearing if you translate the song).
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> theme song for the English dub is literally called "Pokémon Theme Song", not "I Wanna Be The Very Best", nor it is "Gotta Catch 'Em All!".
</li><li> The ending theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoundOfTheSky">Sound of the Sky</a></em> can easily be mistaken to be titled as "Aijou Yuujou" due to the song starting with those words and are repeated a couple of times throughout the song, which becomes all the more memorable due to the cheery nature of the song becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">increasingly dissonant</a> with the mood of the series as it gradually reveals the full extent of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a> setting.

</li><li> The Japanese opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> is called "Sonic Drive", not "S-O-N-I-C" or "Inside Outside".

<ul><li> Similarly, the song "Ping Pong Circulate" is actually "犬Kあ3L" (read as "Inu ka Saru", meaning "Dog or Monkey"). In fact, the assumption goes beyond the title; it's generally believed this is Aikuro's theme since it plays whenever he's around, when the "Inu" in the title indicates it to be Inumuta's theme (or at least the first half, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongStyleShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongStyleShift">second half being Sanageyama's theme</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20d2ji');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20d2ji" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20d2ji');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the kanji for "monkey" (猿) is the first kanji in Sanageyama's name</span>).

This is doubly wrong because that part actually says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics">Ai same CRIER</a>" (Love same crier).
</li><li> Happens to both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> openings (Actually three but the second is a cover of the first). The first opening is called "Moonlight Densetsu", but often appears as "Miracle Romance", and The Stars season opening is called "Sailor Stars Song" not "Makenai"
<ul><li> Ditto for the Mexican dub song, as many fan sites lists it as "El Milagro del Amor" while in official releases the song is either called "Leyenda de luz de luna" (Direct translation) or simply "Tema principal de Sailor Moon" (Sailor Moon main theme)
</li></ul></li><li> The original english opening theme for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a> is not officially called "Rock the Dragon". The official soundtrack simply refers it as "Main Title".
<ul><li> If YouTube is anything to go by, plenty of fans seem to believe the insert song played several times during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s Tournament of Power is titled "Ka-Ka-Kachi Daze"; it's actually called "Ultimate Battle".

Problem is, there is no "Genki no G" — the actual song is "G no Senko", the ending theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG">Gundam: Reconguista in G</a></em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a>s theme song is usually misidentified as Love Will Leave You Crying. Believe it or not, the song is actually identified as Tenchi Muyo.

<ul><li> When Disney Channel aired the song as a music video for filler, they misidentified it as "Dark Side of the Moon".
</li><li> The Brazilian version gets hit even worse in that regard, given there's only one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> compared to the three in the English version (the name is the rendition of the first, "Não Vou Desistir de Nenhum" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note213gj5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note213gj5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note213gj5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"I Won't Quit Anyone"</span>).

<ul><li> The English version also gets frequently mislabeled as "<em>Not</em> One Of Us" (which does, to be fair, more accurately represent the song's context), even on <a class="urllink" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Not_One_of_Us">its Disney wiki page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, despite the movie soundtrack listing it as "One of Us."

<ul><li> The opening song is called "Belle", <strong>not</strong> "Bonjour", "Provincial Life", or "Little Town" (the most common mistake because it's the first words of the song). Especially strange because her name is dropped throughout the song (what with everyone else talking about her).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleThemeTune">Title Theme Tune</a> is not "Tale as Old as Time"; that phrase is just its first line.

<ul><li> The recap song, which starts every verse with once upon a time and ends every verse with here we are in the future is in fact called "Happily Ever After", which only appears in the first and last verses. Making it extra confusing, a shorter version of the song is used as a theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em>, which replaces the eponymous line with the new title.

The one about "ghost riders in the sky"? The full title is "(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend". Note that the "ghost" is in parentheses. It should also be mentioned that the song is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">very old</a>, and <em>Ghost Rider</em> was hardly the first instance of it being used in a movie.

<ul><li> The song that plays on the boombox during the museum sequence is called "Partyman", not "All Hail the New King in Town." Understandable, since the name "Partyman" is so mushily pronounced in the song that it's easy to interpret it as something else, and some variation on "Hail the new king in town" is heard in the song no less than three times (four times, if you count the music video Prince did for MTV).
</li><li> The song in the parade scene is called "Trust." It's not "I Put This Question 2 You", or "W-X-Y-Z" (the song's opening lyrics).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a></em> song that was used in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AloneInTheDark2005">Alone in the Dark (2005)</a></em> is titled "Wish I Had an Angel".

Oddly, the first time the song appears (as Dorothy is leaving Munchkinland and the Munchkins are singing the song), it is titled "Follow the Yellow Brick/You're Off to See the Wizard".

Anybody who hears the song without knowing the title might easily assume the title to be something like "They Say When You Marry in June."
</li><li> The theme music from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> is called "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)".

<ul><li> The opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> made famous by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a> isn't titled "It All Started with a Big Bang" or just "Big Bang" or any variation on that line, it's called "History of Everything". (Or, as the Barenaked Ladies label Raisin' Records says it is, "Big Bang Theory Theme.")
</li><li> The opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> is simply titled "Boss of Me", not "You're Not the Boss of Me Now".
</li><li> The song Ronnie Dobbs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross">David Cross</a>) sings in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow">Mr. Show</a></em> episode (also sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <em>Run Ronnie Run</em>) is actually called "How High The Mountain", not "Y'all are Brutalizing Me."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> recently did a sketch involving a rewritten version of Bobbie Gentry's "Ode to Billy Joe." A summary of the sketch on a website called the original song "Choctaw Ridge."
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, Al is trying to figure out the title of a song. All he knows is "huh huh him". Later he hears the song on the radio, and the chorus is "Go With Him". Then the DJ comes on and says "I know you think that song is called "Go With Him", but it's not!" and then neglects to mention what the title actually is. (It's "Anna" by Arthur Alexander.) <br/><br/>Every line in the song begins with the word 'Anna', while 'Go With Him' is only the refrain. The song itself was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">covered</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, under the title "Anna (Go to Him)". It causes quite a bit of confusion among listeners (at least those who know the title).
</li><li> A rare <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu">tokusatsu</a></em> theme example: The opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyojuuTokusouJuspion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyojuuTokusouJuspion">Kyojuu Tokusou Juspion</a></em> is not "COME ON BOY", it's "Ore ga Seigi da, Juspion!"
</li><li> The theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlackRX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlackRX">Kamen Rider BLACK RX</a></em> is just called "Kamen Rider Black RX", not "Wake Up the Hero".

<ul><li> Francis Scott Key titled his poem "Defense of Fort McHenry". The first person to publish it along with sheet music called it "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the name stuck. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24peos');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24peos" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24peos');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The poem is "Defense of Fort McHenry"; the tune is "Anacreon in Heaven"; when you put them together, you do get "The Star Spangled Banner."</span>
</li><li> In a similar vein, while the hymn/anthem may be called 'Jerusalem', <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamBlake">William Blake</a>'s original poem was <em>definitely</em> entitled 'And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time.' Indeed, Sir Hubert Parry (the first man to set the poem to music) always referred to it by the original title.
<ul><li> The lines don't actually have a title at all. They form part of the Preface to Blake's much longer work, <em>Milton</em>, which he called a Prophetic Book. <em>Jerusalem</em> is the title of another, even longer, of Blake's Prophetic Books but the lines do not form any part of it. Hubert Parry's tune is generally called <em>Jerusalem</em> however.
</li></ul></li><li> The poem opening "How doth the little busy Bee ..." is actually titled "Against Idleness and Mischief".
</li><li> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's arguably most well-known poem is known as <em>Über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh</em> (Above all peaks there is quiet), after its first line, or <em>Wandrers Nachtlied</em> (The Wanderer's Night-Song). However, at its first publication Goethe merely entitled it <em>Ein Gleiches</em> (A Similar One), with reference to an earlier poem entitled <em>Wandrers Nachtlied</em>) which was printed above it on the same page.
</li><li> Prussia's inofficial national anthem, <em>Üb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit</em> (Always practice loyalty and honesty), which is sung to the tune of Papageno's aria <em>Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen</em> from Mozart's <em>Magic Flute</em>, is actually entitled: <em>Der alte Landmann an seinen Sohn</em> (The old countryman (peasant) to his son). The poem was writen by Ludwig Heinrich Christoph Hölty.
</li><li> The opening line is "'Twas the night before Christmas", but the poem was titled "A Visit From St. Nicholas".
</li><li> The poem that begins "You are old, Father William" (the original version, not the Lewis Carroll parody) is actually titled "The Old Man's Comforts and How He Gained Them".
</li><li> The name of one of Juan de Dios Peza's most famous poems is "Reír Llorando"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note251svc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note251svc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note251svc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"To Laugh While Weeping "</span>, although is commonly referred to as "Garrick".

<ul><li> Sheamus's theme is called "Written in My Face", not "Too Many Lies" or "These Words Are True" or "Now It's Time to Bleed" or "You Wear Your Cowardice Well." (Or "Too Many Limes", or "It's A Shameful Thing, Lobster Head".)
</li><li> Antonio Cesaro's pre-Real Americans theme, "Miracle", has lyrics that are just about indecipherable, not helped by constantly switching between French and German. The word 'miracle' does actually feature prominently in the chorus, albeit with French pronunciation. That aside, one of the lines sounds vaguely like "What's wrong with this chair?" - and so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">that is what fans have taken to calling the song</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>'s entrance theme was not called "Can You Dig It?"; it was called "Rap Sheet." Listeners were often misled because Booker could be heard bellowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey">"Can you dig it...sucka?!"</a> just before the music started up. And strangely enough, Booker T <em>did</em> record a rap titled "Can You Dig It?" for the <em>WWE Originals</em> album.
</li><li> This most commonly happens with the <em>Raw</em> or <em>SmackDown</em> themes (the only theme tunes in WWE to be regularly played in their entirety, or close to their entirety).
<ul><li> "Across the Nation" (the <em>Raw</em> theme during the years when WWE was slowly transitioning from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a> to the current TV-PG era, and appropriate for a show that appears in a different part of North America every week) has the actual words "across the nation" in its lyrics, but they are slipped in so casually that it's easy to miss them. A newcomer was more likely to think the song was titled "Let's Get It On" or "Move to the Music" or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">"Play That Fuckin' Music"</a>, since those are the lines that are uttered most often by the performers.
</li><li> "To Be Loved", the Papa Roach number that replaced "Across the Nation" in 2006. Although "I just wanna be, wanna be loved" is featured prominently in the chorus, the tempo of the overall song is so absurdly fast that it's easy to miss most of the lyrics; about the only thing that the first-time listener could be expected to make out would be the echoing "Whoa-oa-oa-oa" sound effect at the beginning of the chorus, so you'd be forgiven for referring to "To Be Loved" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">"that 'Whoa-oa-oa-oa' song."</a>
</li><li> "Rise Up", the <em>SmackDown</em> theme for many years, did have the words "rise up" spoken just before the chorus, but in a cartoonishly evil voice that sounded more like "RAAAUUGH!" The chorus itself prominently features the phrase "Break it up, break it down" - and so that was how first-timers tended to refer to it. Of course, they were probably thinking of the D-Generation X theme, which <em>is</em> called "Break It Down."
</li><li> The <em>SmackDown</em> theme back in 2010 was titled "Let It Roll" - not "You're Goin' Down."
</li><li> The 2014-2015 <em>SmackDown</em> theme was called "Born to Run" - which is obviously going to confuse a whole lot of viewers over the age of 30, since that is more famously the name of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">(and no, the WWE "Born to Run" isn't a cover)</a>. You'd never know it if you're just a casual WWE fan, though, since the chorus is better known for the lines "The sky turns black, it don't matter" and "Now the sun is comin' up" - and the final word of "We were [not "I was"] born to run" itself is drawn out and deliberately mispronounced as "reh-un", probably to avoid sounding too much like Springsteen.
</li><li> The 2012-2016 <em>Raw</em> theme was just called "Tonight", not "Tonight Is the Night" (despite what you may think if you stumble upon a stream of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/VideoGameChampionshipWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/VideoGameChampionshipWrestling">Video Game Championship Wrestling</a></em>, where the chatroom will "sing" along with some of the lyrics, especially the full "Tonight is the night" line that opens the song).
</li><li> The 2016-2018 RAW theme was called "Enemies", not "You Want More" "20 to 1" or "Down On Your Knees"

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Theater </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Opera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Opera">opera</a> songs rarely have official titles, the established convention is for an aria's first line to serve as an unofficial title. This is useful for the singers/orchestra so that everyone knows that they are all (literally) on the same page. However, the first line generally isn't the most memorable, making it confusing from the audience's perspective.
<ul><li> From <em>Pagliacci</em>: the crying clown aria is called "Vesti la giubba (Put on the Costume)", not the soaring, climactic lyrics "Ridi, Pagliaccio (Laugh, Clown!)".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca">Tosca</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a> is actually called "Tre sbirri, una carozza (Three cops, one carriage)". It's usually either referred to as "Va, Tosca" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith">The One with...</a> The Te Deum.
</li><li> Averted with "Vissi d'arte (I lived for art)", which actually is the part everyone remembers.

Very few of their songs are named after the best-known line of their refrain, because they're all named after the first line of the song's opening verse.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePiratesOfPenzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Pirate King's song, best known by the refrain, "I am a Pirate King/You are, hurrah for the Pirate King!/And it is, it is a glorious thing to be a Pirate King!" is of course titled, "Oh, Better Far to Live and Die".
</li><li> The trio known by the refrain, "A paradox/A paradox/A most ingenious paradox!/With quips and quibbles heard in flocks/None can beat this paradox!" is naturally called, "When You Had Left Our Pirate Fold".
</li><li> The refrain, "I am an Orphan Boy/An Orphan Boy/An Orphan Boy/How sad, an Orphan Boy/For he is an Orphan Boy/He is, hurrah for the Orphan Boy!/And it sometimes is a useful thing to be an Orphan Boy" is part of a song titled, "Oh, Men of Dark and Dismal Fate".
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorGeneralSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajorGeneralSong">I am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General</a>" is an aversion.

Like the example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AChorusLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AChorusLine">A Chorus Line</a></em>, it's probably for the purpose of making the joke more of a surprise.
</li><li> For the thousandth time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">"What is this Feeling?"</a> is <em>not</em> entitled "Loathing!"
</li><li> The musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors">Little Shop of Horrors</a></em> has quite a few of these. Two prominent examples are "Skid Row" (often referred to as "Downtown") and "Git It" (more popularly known as "Feed Me").
</li><li> "By My Side" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Godspell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Godspell">Godspell</a></em> is not called "Where Are You Going", although this is the first line said and the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> doesn't come in for a long time.
</li><li> "The Flesh Failures" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hair">Hair</a></em> is simply legendary. You don't remember "The Flesh Failures"? It's the one that ended with a long refrain of "let the sun shine in, let the sun shine in..."
<ul><li> This is made worse by the fact that this refrain was released at the end of the 5th Dimension's "Age of Aquarius" single as "Age of Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine in."
</li><li> Actually, "The Flesh Failures" describes the first lyrical passage of the finale preceding "Let the Sunshine In" ("We starve, look at one another short of breath; Walking proudly in our winter coats..."). Although, even this is sometimes referred to as "Eyes Look Your Last" due to the background singers' counterpoint in the second stanza.

<ul><li> You know that number that goes "He had it coming, he had it coming, he only had himself to blame..."? Well, it isn't called "He Had it Coming", as it can be found on certain file sharing sites as. It's called "Cell Block Tango".
</li><li> And that ragtime-like song? It's "Press Conference Rag", not "They Reached For the Gun." (Actually, it's a bit of a complex example. It was <em>originally</em> called "Press Conference Rag" (and that should still be the title if you're a purist), but so many people mislabeled it that "We Both Reached For the Gun" became the <em>new</em> title.)

The original title, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tits and Ass</span>," is the actual refrain, was changed to keep from giving away the joke (and/or avoid offending those casually inspecting the list of numbers).
</li><li> It's fairly common for musicals to include at least one song where the title is either a joke or a reference to the staging and not actually part of the lyrics.
<ul><li> The opening song in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls">Guys and Dolls</a></em> is called "Fugue for Tinhorns," but everybody knows it by its first and last line, "I Got the Horse Right Here" (or perhaps as "Paul Revere," the name of the horse in question).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ByeByeBirdie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ByeByeBirdie">Bye Bye Birdie</a></em> has "The Telephone Hour" (the "Hi Margie/Hi Alice" song) and "Hymn for a Sunday Evening" (the "Ed Sullivan" song).
</li><li> "A Hymn to Him" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MyFairLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MyFairLady">My Fair Lady</a></em> is sometimes referred to by the first line of its refrain, "Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">The real title never appears in the song.</a>

<ul><li> The famous show tune is actually called "Seasons of Love", not "525,600 Minutes".
</li><li> "Another Day" is sometimes referred to as "Me and My Guitar" after the first lines of the song.
</li><li> And the song at the end is called "Finale B", not "No Day But Today".
<ul><li> The version of the song performed at Life Support isn't called "No Day But Today" either, it's called "Life Support".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease">Grease</a></em>:
<ul><li> That tune sung by both Danny and Sandy early on is not called "Summer Loving" or "Tell Me More". It's called "Summer Nights" (which is actually the refrain).
</li><li> One of the songs that plays in the background during the dance contest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> (and is actually sung by Doody in the original play) is "Those Magic Changes", not "What's That Playing On the Radio?"

Honestly though, the latter title would make more sense, as its sung consistently more than the former phrase.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CityOfAngels">City of Angels</a></em>, the title of "Double Talk" is not the song's melodic hook, which is instead provided by the first line of both Stone's refrain and Stine's refrain: "This job is not to be believed." The words "double talk" do occur once in both, and describe the context of the verses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesusChristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesusChristSuperstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></em> has three notable examples:

</li><li> The song that begins <em>"I only want to say..."</em> is called "Gethsemane", though it's sometimes labeled as "Gethsemane (I Only Want To Say)".
</li><li> The final number is not "Jesus Christ Superstar" - it's simply "Superstar".
</li></ul></li><li> Amy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong">Patter Song</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CompanySondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CompanySondheim">Company</a></em> is just "Getting Married Today", not "Not Getting Married Today".
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> was originally released, it was accompanied with a soundtrack containing lyricised versions of several songs from the game. Some familiar with the lyrics tend to assume that the name of the first (and most famous) song on the album is "I Believe in You." Some unfamiliar with the lyrics tend to call it "Pollyanna's Theme." Turns out <em>both</em> groups are wrong — the name of the song is simply "Pollyanna" (though to be fair, the full title for the lyricised version is technically "Pollyanna (I Believe in You)"), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">there is no character by that name in any game in the series</a>. (There <em>is</em> a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">Paula</a>" and an "Ana", but neither character is closely associated with the song in question.) "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pollyanna">Pollyanna</a>" is simply a term used to describe the kind of extremely positive person the song is about.
</li><li> The song at the credit roll of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening">3</a></em> is titled "Devils Never Cry," although a lot of people call it "The Devil's Cry," after the last words of the song. Humorously, the song featured in the fourth game ("Shall Never Surrender") does not fall under this trope.
<ul><li> While most people call the two battle themes that play during <em>DMC3</em> "Taste the Blood" and "Divine Hate", their actual titles according to the soundtrack are "Battle-1 (Battle Music 1)" and "Battle-2 (Battle Music 2)" respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> That oddly epic song that plays throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> is not called "Audi Famam Illius". The title <em>actually is</em> "Super Smash Bros. Brawl Main Theme."
</li><li> The Japanese/European opening song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em> is called "Sonic - You Can Do Anything", not "Toot Toot Sonic Warrior." The credits song is called "Cosmic Eternity - Believe in Yourself."
</li><li> The actual song that was used as the ending theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> is called "Sweet Sweet Sweet", not "Sweet Dream" (though the English version of the song released later was actually titled "Sweet Dreams").
<ul><li> Shadow's theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> is erroneously titled by some as "All of the Darkness," based on the lyric "All of the darkness that dozes in the dusk" — except, close as that sounds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">those aren't the actual lyrics</a> (that'd be "Oh dark, the darkness that dozes in the dusk"). The song's actual title is the immediately following line, "Throw It All Away."
</li><li> Similarly, Dr. Eggman's theme is not titled "I Am the Eggman," it's actually "E.G.G.M.A.N.", which is actually in the song, though it's hard to spot (it's chanted by robotic voices in the background). Amy's theme is "My Sweet Passion," not "Hearts on Fire" or "Sweet, Sweet, You're So Sweet" or any variation. Knuckles's theme is titled "Unknown from M.E.", not any variation of "Born on an Island in the Heavens" or "Here I am, tougher than the rest of them..." Big's theme is "Lazy Days ~Livin' in Paradise~", not "Welcome to Our Paradise." Tails' theme is not "I Wanna Fly High" but "Believe in Myself".
</li><li> And moving away from character themes, the song that plays during Shadow's fight against the Biolizard is called "Supporting Me", not "To the Pressure" or "Losing You."
</li><li> The theme to the level City Escape is actually titled "Escape from the City," which does appear in the lyrics, but possibly as an inversion of this trope some think it's also called "City Escape." It's also sometimes incorrectly titled "Follow Me".
</li><li> Knuckles's level songs all have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a>: Wild Canyon ("Kick the Rock!"), Pumpkin Hill ("A Ghost's Pumpkin Soup"), Aquatic Mine ("Dive into the Mellow"), Death Chamber ("Deeper"), Meteor Herd ("Space Trip Steps"). The stage names, however, all appear in the lyrics.
</li><li> White Jungle's theme is titled "Rhythm and Balance," not "Shadow, Don't Make Me Upset."
</li><li> Team Sonic's theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em> is titled "We Can (Theme of Team Sonic)", not "We Can Make It" or any variation on "So Much Better Than Alone."
</li><li> The main theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em> is not titled "I Am." It's actually "I Am... All of Me", despite those two phrases never actually appearing in that order until the very LAST line of the song. And it's not "I Am All of Me" or even "I Am (All of Me)" either, the actual title does contain an ellipsis.
</li><li> In Psyguy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Fireball20XL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Fireball20XL">Fireball 20XL</a></em>'s parody dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie">Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie</a></em>, Knuckles complains "Aww, I hate 'In His World'" when the tune starts playing during Sonic's first battle with Metal Sonic. The song is actually called "His World." (And "In his world" doesn't even appear in the lyrics, the line goes "In this world (His world!), where life is strong...")
</li></ul></li><li> The theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em> is not called "Dovahkiin." Yes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">Ominous Dragon Chanting</a> does go <em>"Dovahkiin! Dovahkiin!</em>, but the actual title is "Sons of Skyrim." "Dovahkiin" is a completely different song. Both songs have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Titles</a>. Confused yet?
</li><li> Pig With The Face Of A Boy's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/hWTFG3J1CP8">song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is called "A Complete History of the Soviet Union Through the Eyes of a Humble Worker, Arranged to the Melody of Tetris," not "I Am the Man Who Arranges the Blocks." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">And the melody itself isn't "Tetris song"; it's from Russian folk song "Korobeiniki"</a> (which itself is a victim of this trope — it's not "Oy polnym polna mоya korobushka").
</li><li> Non-lyrical example: The main musical motif that plays in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games when pressuring a witness or discovering the culprit is called the "Pursuit" theme for that game. The theme in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">first game</a> is titled "Pursuit ~ Cornered", leading some fans to refer to the songs in subsequent games as their "Cornered" theme.
</li><li> The ending song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has <em>two</em> official titles. On the US soundtrack, it's listed as "Kimi no Kioku", but on the Japanese soundtrack, it's officially titled "Memories of You". The two titles mean the same thing (and neither appear in the song), but it's interesting that the <em>Japanese</em> album uses the <em>English</em> title and vice versa.
<ul><li> Also from that game, the battle music is just called "Mass Destruction", not "Shadows of Mass Destruction" or "Baby Baby Baby".
</li></ul></li><li> The credits theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> is a solemn jazz tune named "In a Moment's Time". Due to the lyrics, however, most people instead call it "In <em>Just</em> a Moment's Time".
</li><li> This manages to happen to <em>every</em> song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA">Daytona USA</a></em>.
<ul><li> "The King of Speed", the music to the Beginner course, is much more commonly known by the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"Rolling Start"</a>, as these two words are belted out twice at the very beginning and the rest of the lyrics are a series of vocalizations by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi. Confusingly, there actually <em>is</em> a song in the game called "Rolling Start"... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oURt4oC-TjA">and it's a truncated remix of "The King of Speed" played during the course's post-race replay and staff roll.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Advanced course's music is well-known for its vocalization of "DAYTONAAAAAA!", to the point that it's mistaken for the song's name. The actual name is the very next lyric: "Let's Go Away".
</li><li> "Sky High", the Expert course's theme, is occasionally misnamed as "I Wanna Fly Sky High" or "Blue Blue Skies", though it doesn't get this as commonly as the other two.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a></em>'s theme song, titled "War!", is commonly called "War Has Never Been So Much Fun."
</li><li> When it was revealed, the vocal theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> was variously known as "1-Up Girl" or "Let's Do the Odyssey" thanks to its lyrics. It was eventually given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> "Jump Up, Super Star!" by the game's <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/mario_odysseyJP/status/875264231506984961">official Twitter account.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Some background tracks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> are commonly referred to by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">the ocarina song</a> that they derive from such as "Lost Woods" being called "Saria's Song", "Lon Lon Ranch" being called "Epona's Song" and "Windmill Hut" being called "Song of Storms". However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> at least, the Lost Woods theme <em>is</em> named "Saria's Song" (and same for the Windmill Hut being "Song of Storms"), potentially making it the reverse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> fans have a big issue with misattributing song titles in general, but most fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> rather than this. One case where it applies to <em>dialogue</em> rather than lyrics comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star</a></em>; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmTreePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmTreePanic">beach stage</a> theme from <em>Revenge of Meta Knight</em> is often misnamed "Grape Garden", which is mentioned in dialogue while the song plays. Its official name is simply "Sea Stage". Grape Garden is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblyClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblyClouds">cloud level</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure">Kirby's Adventure</a></em>, completely unrelated other than being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrazyTaxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrazyTaxi">Crazy Taxi</a> has the song "All I Want" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a>. It's often referred to as "Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya" after its opening line which always plays when you first start out.
</li><li> The main menu theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> is titled "Gangster Friday". "Grand Theft Auto" is the first song on the game's N-CT FM station, and thanks to the repeated hook "Let's go for a joyride", it's called "Joyride" by some.

<ul><li> The first song in Act II of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a></em> is officially titled "My Eyes", but is often referred to as "On the Rise". There was a gap of several months between the release of the video and the release of the soundtrack and song titles.
<ul><li> Most of <em>Doctor Horrible</em> has that problem, due to the aforementioned gap between the release of the musical and the release of official titles for the songs.
</li><li> In all honesty, the entire production is full of this. "Penny's Song" or "Story of a Girl"? And just how <em>are</em> you supposed to name the Bad Horse Choruses? Not to mention that despite "Brand New Day" being the closer of Act II, the opener of Act III, "So They Say", ends on "Or is this a brand new day?" Sure, we know all of it <em>now</em>, but...
<ul><li> To clear up confusion: the official titles (according to the soundtrack albums) are "Penny's Song", "Bad Horse Chorus" and "Bad Horse Chorus (Reprise)".
</li><li> Also, reportedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> will break down and cry if you call it "Laundry Day". It's "My Freeze Ray".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a>:</em> The song Stacy's relatives sing in "Summer Belongs to You" is officially titled "J-Pop (Welcome to Tokyo)", not "Welcome to Tokyo".
<ul><li> A good number of P&amp;F songs fall under title confusion. Some songs are given titles on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule">the wiki</a> before the episode comes out, only these titles are different from the official BMI titles, which are sometimes different from the titles the writers and creators use. However, the song's unofficial, incorrect titles tend to spread fairly quickly over the Internet and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. Three examples: "History of Rock" not "Danny's Story", "Big Ginormous Airplane" not "The Paper Pelican Floor Show", and "Baliwood" not "Destroyed Dreams".
</li><li> The general, "official" rule is to go by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">whatever the creators use</a>. Example: The song is "Evil for Extra Credit", even though the official BMI title is "Evil for College Credit".
</li><li> The song played during the Big Idea in "Last Day of Summer" is "There's No One I'd Rather Go Nowhere With", and not "There's No One <em>That</em> I'd Rather Go Nowhere With".
</li></ul></li><li> The iconic instrumental tune associated with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> cartoons is usually referred to as "Peanuts" or "The Charlie Brown Theme" - or, sometimes, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">"that kinda African-sounding jazz tune."</a> It's actually called "Linus and Lucy" - which is confusing in itself, since Linus is merely Charlie Brown's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Lancer</a> (and truth be told, <em>Snoopy</em> gets higher billing than him) while Lucy is simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a>. This tends to bring a lot of confusion, as there is already a song called "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/80ojk1dwbos">Charlie Brown Theme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
<ul><li> It's not really <em>all that</em> confusing. "Linus and Lucy" was originally just the theme for, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Linus and Lucy</a>.

Since it's also <em>by far</em> the catchiest tune from the cartoons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BootStrappedTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BootStrappedTheme">it's the part everybody remembers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The theme song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>, made famous by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, is actually "Believe in Yourself", not "And I Say Hey" or simply "HEY!", no matter how many times the latter nickname is used in the song.
</li><li> "Awaken" by Dethklok is not called "Mustakrakish." It doesn't help that in the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> where the song first appeared Nathan calls it "Awaken, Awaken Mustakrakish The Lake Troll."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Looking for that song that you probably know as "The Bird Is the Word"? Well, you won't find it under that name, it's actually called "Surfin' Bird", by The Trashmen, although it is based partly on an R&amp;B song called "The Bird's the Word" by The Rivingtons. ("Papa-Ooh-Mau-Mau" is another popular "title.")
</li><li> Not to mention that episode the song was featured in ("I Dream Of Jesus") actually mentioned that the song was called "Surfin' Bird".
</li></ul></li><li> The closing music for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FireballXL5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FireballXL5">Fireball XL5</a>" was originally called "Fireball", but was commonly called by its first line, "I Wish I Was a Spaceman".

<ul><li> The title song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls">Equestria Girls</a></em>, also known as the "Cafeteria Song", is usually mistaken as "Helping Twilight Win the Crown". The title doesn't even appear in the film version's lyrics.
</li><li> "Time To Come Together", also from <em>Equestria Girls</em>, is also commonly called "Fix It Up" after the line that starts the chorus.
</li><li> Twilight's song as she tries to fit in at Canterlot High is not called "Strange New World", it's "This Strange World", as the credits say. She never says the latter title once.
</li><li> Two songs from the first two seasons, commonly referred to as "Giggle at the Ghosty" and "Smile Smile Smile" were later given the titles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSomethingSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSomethingSong">"The Laughter Song" and "The Smile Song"</a> respectively in the first album.
</li><li> A second season song where Rarity sings about enjoying high society was named "Becoming Popular", and not "The Pony Everypony Should Know" as many viewers thought. Later, to help with the confusion, the two titles were officially combined into "Becoming Popular (The Pony Everypony Should Know)".
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E24TheManeAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E24TheManeAttraction">The Mane Attraction</a>", Countess Coloratura's song, "The Magic Inside", was previously called "I Am Just a Pony" by fans.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a> is not called "Stop the Pigeon".
<ul><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisTreasureHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisTreasureHunt">Yogi's Treasure Hunt</a></em> episode "Yogi's Heroes." Dick and Muttley capture Snooper and Blabber and torture them by making them watch old <em>Dastardly &amp; Muttley</em> episodes, which Snooper called "Stop That Pigeon-type cartoons."
</li></ul></li><li> "Stronger than You" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a>:</em> the title only gets sung in the final refrain, while "I am made of love" is sung in every refrain, leading some to initially mislabel the song as "Made of Love."
