</div></div><p>The villain stands poised for victory; he stares out at the ensuing carnage — all is going according to plan. The audience, sure of his intentions and motivations, hates him, loathes him, wants him to die, and knows deep down that they have every right to.

</p><p>The storytellers cut back to earlier days; a time of would-be happiness for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">younger, gentler person</a>: the villain in his youth. In a short time, perhaps a single quip, or a single, unnarrated action, we see it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">the event</a> that tainted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">jaded</a>, and turned a normal, loving person, perhaps even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">a hero</a>, into an unforgiving villain. Suddenly, the audience slinks down; some cringe, others start to tear up — for all intents and purposes, a real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>.
</p><p>The audience begins to see the bigger picture: evil isn't born, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">it's made</a>. Everybody has a story, as the old saying goes, and a villain's story is often tragic. After a lifetime of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">rejection, dismissal, cruelty, and hate</a>, who wouldn't become a villain? And when that cruelty comes full-circle back to the originators, why are they the victims? Finally, the biggest question pops into the audience's mind: what if? What if someone, even one person, had shown even an inkling of kindness or love to them? What if someone stood up for them? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love can change</a>, right? Then couldn't it also prevent?

At this point, one feels what can only be described as anti-schadenfreude, and when one's sympathy or empathy for a villain's position reaches its peak, that's when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Cry For The Devil</a>.
</p><p>This goes back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">at least to the 17th century</a>; characters from all walks of life have been reexamined again and again, and often times, the worst, most evil villains make the greatest sympathetic, although still evil, protagonists. Put simply, humans are fascinated by what could turn someone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>, most likely because we realize how easily we ourselves could, as well.
</p><p>It's supposed to be a possible end-result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> done well. Frequently used to build the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a>. A particularly compelling version of this can even humanize a character, at least in the eyes of some fans. It will likely also turn the character into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a> for the fandom. Common keywords for pointing out the trope include something along the lines of "It's not really his fault he's evil, but..."

In fact, if the reason for the villain's popularity was that the audience actively <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">enjoyed</a></em> hating them, then woobifying them can <em>backfire</em> because it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">removes what made the villain so beloved in the first place</a> and, in turn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">makes them feel like less of a threat</a>. In addition, this trope tends to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">A Million Is a Statistic</a> for the sympathy accorded to their victims; it can feel frustrating when the author is chastising you for "judging" a character who just got finished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuking a city full of innocent people</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">gleefully cackling all the while</a>.

Not quite the same as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">Sympathy for the Devil</a>—that's when <em>characters</em> in story sympathize with a villain, not just the audience.

<ul><li> Diva's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em> is definitely worth the viewer's pity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As a baby, she was separated from her twin sister, Saya, as soon as she was born and locked in a tower without a name and with nothing but the basic necessities to live. Her only companion was a man who was completely obsessed with her and only viewed her as a very interesting, study worthy creature. She spends the first sixty something years of her life like this, after which she escapes with her caretaker. As a result of her seclusion and her ruthless upbringing, she developed an unstable, immature personality and severe attachment issues, being unable to respond to her Chevaliers' undying devotion and affection (which messed up quite a few of them). Despite her deep, desperate craving for a family of her own, she never obtains it, as she dies before her babies emerge from their cocoons.</span>
<ul><li> This also extends in-universe: After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she finally succeeds at killing Diva</span>, Saya starts bawling her eyes out.
</li></ul></li><li> This is true for almost all Awakened Beings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>. They are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">man-eating monsters</a>, and many of them are also very vicious and sadistic. But each of them was once a young girl (or a boy, in the first generation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">most of the warriors were male</a>), who watched her family being killed and eaten by youma, and then was taken away by a malevolent organization to be transformed into a half-human fighting machine that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination">hated and despised by the other humans</a> and had to fight against youma until one day she lost control of her powers and turned into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn">Awakened Being</a>.
<ul><li> The anime even shows Priscilla crying when she eats human guts. And Isley explains that she is an Awakened Being, and her body can digest nothing other than human guts.
</li><li> Of course, some Awakened Beings were evil even before they were transformed, such as Roxanne.
</li></ul></li><li> Lucy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>. As the series begins, Lucy is seen escaping a laboratory, and mercilessly slaughtering anyone, and we mean <em>anyone</em>, who stands in her way. It's a complete and utter mystery as to why she seems to be unwilling to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEverydude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEverydude">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">male</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">protagonist</a>, Kouta. Cut to a few chapters/episodes later and we are shown the girl's hellish childhood. Turns out that Lucy, whose real name is Kaede, was abandoned by her father at an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a>, where she was mercilessly tormented by the other children and neglected by the staff, who only pretended to be nice to her and spoke ill of her when they thought she wasn't listening. It all culminated with some of the children, led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Tomoo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">slowly killing her puppy (the only living being she's ever cared for) in front of her, revealed to them by a supposed friend that backstabbed her, and laughing at her misery</a>. Cue the girl going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and slaughtering them all in a textbook example of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Beware the Nice Ones</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBathVillainOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBathVillainOrigin">Blood Bath Villain Origin</a>. And thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">Kaede ceased to be</a>, and Lucy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">destroyer of mankind</a>, was born...
<ul><li> This was merely the beginning: after meeting Kouta, befriending him, and almost turning their relationship into something more, she discovered that he lied to her...about the gender of the cousin he was going to a festival with. Broken and betrayed, the girl flew once more into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> and crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brutally killing everyone around her, including Kouta's family right in front of him</span>. Ultimately, this cemented her decision that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">all humanity had to simply die</a>.
<ul><li> And that's without mentioning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that most of her murders were dictated by the manipulations of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">inner voice</a></span>.

</li><li> The straightest example is Johan's suicidal tendencies and his attitude to other evil people. Throughout the story, the impression is that he is tired with his own evil nature, something everyone else makes a big deal of, but which, for him, is so plain, ordinary, and banal. He remarks that he is searching for the darkest place or person in the world, but fails to find it, presumably in a search for somewhere he can belong, which won't happen as his thought process is simply so alien from ordinary people that he can never fit in. Hence, he encourages people to try and kill him, and doesn't particularly care for all the grand plans his "followers" expect from him and he presumably fulfills them only because he's bored and he views it as a way to pass the time. Or he may just be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntichrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntichrist">The Antichrist</a>, but that's probably just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">Rule of Symbolism</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Probably.</a>

But for good measure, when he's entering the final phase of his plan to destroy the world, we get to see a page or so from back when he was six. If the horrified look on his face after having his mother shot down in cold blood <em>by the government</em> isn't enough for you, then seeing his reaction to being locked up had better be.

For example, Medusa would lock him/her in a dark room (and s/he was terrified of the dark) with Ragnarok, who repeatedly beat him/her, as punishment for his/her refusal to kill another living creature. And Medusa would leave Crona in that room for <em>days</em>, not caring if he/she was starving to death as a result. She kept doing it again and again until s/he would finally give in. It's also implied that s/he never had any friends or received any compassion until Maka reached out to him/her.

He is cruel, manipulative, and merciless to those who owe him money or stand in his way, and uses a helpless teenage girl to further his plans. Then, in a flashback episode, the audience sees that Suitengu and his little sister were sold off to pay some of the debt his parents incurred. He was forced into the military to fight for whoever bought him, while his prepubescent sister was sold into prostitution. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Years later, he finally tracks her down, only to find that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">so broken</a> that she doesn't recognize him, and he euthanizes her before weeping, distraught, over her body.</span> Everything that he did since was a part of an elaborate plan for revenge against the people directly responsible for his ruined life and the society that allowed it to happen.

To the world he's known as the most powerful and evil mage in history, and is responsible for creating demons and dark magics that still continue to wreak havoc today.

A while later, he meets Mavis, the first and only person to ever show him genuine kindness, causing him to teach her magic that inadvertently makes her immortal. He eventually falls in love with her, and just when it looks like he's got a chance at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalLove">Eternal Love</a> and a tiny glimmer of hope at being happy, his curse kills her body causing her to be placed in suspended animation.

A large number of fanfics try to make the Kyuubi into a likable character using this strategy. Apparently, the savagely murderous and vile Kyuubi was just angry because somebody was picking on it or its family; the resulting murderous rampage that killed hundreds and orphaned just as many was a mistake it's very sorry for. Oh, and it's a girl. This backstory has been in use for several years now and has changed little since then, even ignoring key revelations in the manga that would negate it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em> begins by showing the audience Heathcliff as an adult, nasty and abusive to everyone he's around (even sending his hunting dogs after his guest) and then quickly shows his childhood, when he had potential to be a better person. One line that stands out is when, at one point in the story, Nelly, the main narrator, consoles a crying Heathcliff by telling him that he may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes">lost Asian prince</a> out of a fairy tale, leading him to imagine regaining such status and taking revenge on everyone who has wronged him in a way that foreshadows his later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>.

Thus, he was bad from the start and his experiences in life are no excuse for who he is. On the completely opposite side of that is Harry, who had a bad childhood too, and yet is a very surprisingly selfless person.

Even after that, in their final confrontation, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harry tries to convince Voldemort to feel some remorse for his deeds to help him restore his soul.

Frodo hates Gollum at first, but eventually pities and tries to help him—in fact, we can see some of Gollum in Frodo himself.
<div class="indent"><strong>Frodo</strong>: But do you remember Gandalf's words: <strong>Even Gollum may have something yet to do?</strong> But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring.

Yet by the end of the novel, when he dies alone and unloved it is possible to feel immense sympathy for him.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> all of the Traitor Primarchs, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Alpharius Omegon</a>, have this to one degree or another.
<ul><li> Horus Lupecal. The Warmaster. The Arch-Traitor. And in <em>Horus Rising</em> we see the man before he was corrupted by Chaos; a Primarch who truly loved his sons and enjoyed spending time with them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the Warrior Lodge of which he wasn't even in charge, he just liked to attend and be around his sons in a place where rank was unimportant</span>, and a warrior who was willing to negotiate with other civilisations rather than conquer them outright and in his dealings with the Interex actually seemed desperate to, for once, make peace with someone rather than just crush them. And then on Davin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is wounded by the Athame and tricked by the Chaos Gods into accepting darkness into his heart. And by Erebus who takes the form of Hastur Sejanus, who was essentially Horus' best friend and was murdered prior to the start of the book, and uses Horus' love of Sejanus to nudge him into accepting the Gods offer.</span> Horus became a monster, but before that it's easy to see why he was among the greatest of the Primarchs.
</li><li> Angron. The Red Angel. One of the most insane of the Primarchs and one damaged from the start, obsessed with killing and slaughter and barely even functional at the best of times. But he was once a little boy whose first contact with humanity was to be enslaved and forced to be a slave-gladiator for arrogant and cruel nobles. They cracked open his head and gave him the Butcher's Nails, an antique technology that causes him constant cripping agony and puts him into uncontrollable rages. And after years of degradation Angron finally leads a rebellion that is doomed to fail, and at the moment of his final battle the Emperor arrives and offers to take him to birthright. Angron says no, wishing to die with his brothers and sisters. So does the Emperor help him or respect his wishes? He abducts him and Angron watches everyone he knew and cared about be slaughtered.
</li><li> Mortarion. The Death Lord. Raised on a poisonous world ruled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> known only as the Warlords, taken in by the most powerful of them and raised as a weapon rather than a son, he eventually escapes and leads his people to freedom. But his final moment of triumph is stolen by the Emperor who cuts down his foster father in front of him, and it's implied that Mortarion had conflicted feelings about him, and he must bend his knee in servitude. He joins Horus for selfish reasons but comes to the attention of Nurgle, and when his Legion is decimated by plague and he must make a choice between horrific deaths and pain or serving Nurgle, he chooses to serve Nurgle from fear of dying. And why did he have to make that choice? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Because his treacherous First Captain Calas Typhon put them in that situation so that it would happen.</span>
</li><li> Fulgrim. The Phoenician. Fulgrim's very first contact with his Legion was learning that they had been decimated by gene-seed problems and that only 200 lived, whereas most Legions had 100,000 marines and more. Not daunted he gave such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> that the Emperor himself was impressed and gave them the right to bear his personal symbol, the Aquila. But that was clearly the start of Fulgrim's obsession with perfection, living up to his father's pride and proving that there was nothing wrong with his Legion. Eventually he finds the Blade of Laer and it slowly begins corrupting him, twisting his love of art and culture into something depraved, turning him against the sons who truly love him and his closest brother Ferrus Manus, and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pushes him into murdering Manus. Fulgrim immediately sees the horror of what he has become and begs for oblivion, which the Daemon inside the blade grants him by possessing him. Fulgrim does eventually break free but had to sell his soul to achieve it.</span> Like Horus Fulgrim became a monster, perhaps the worst of them all, but he was one of the friendliest and nicest Primarchs before that.
</li><li> Magnus the Red. The Cyclops. The most knowledgeable about the Primarchs, who made a faustian bargain with the Warp to save his sons from mutation. He builds a great civilisation of psykers and then is forced to watch as his brothers call him an unclean warlock and madman for dabbling with what he does not understand, and the Emperor demands that his Legion cease their psyker practices and pursuits into sorcery. Magnus is truly hurt but still tries to warn the Emperor of Horus' treachery, but picked the worst way and time to do it. Cue the Burning of Prospero <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where the Space Wolves raze Prospero, butcher its people and cut down the Thousand Sons as they fight to defend their home. Magnus is so despondent over everything that he can't even muster the will to fight, until he sees Leman Russ murdering his sons, whereupon he joins the fight and is forced to pledge his soul to Tzeentch to save what remains of his Legion.</span> If the Emperor had just levelled with Magnus about Chaos, perhaps Magnus could have had a much different future...
</li><li> Lorgar Aurelian. The Golden. Lorgar was the most corrupt of all the Primarchs and the most tragic. Before becoming the Arch-Priest of Chaos he was perhaps the Primarch most interested in improving humanity's lot and genuinely cared about people; he wanted to please the Emperor and his brother Primarchs, and preached a religion based on love of your fellow man and standing together in unity. The Emperor is not pleased and after destroying a city on one of Lorgar's worlds to make his point, point-blank tells Lorgar and the Word Bearers that they are the only ones that have truly disappointed and failed him, that Lorgar's childhood conquering his homeworld in the Emperor's name was a waste of time and life, and that everything they have achieved is worthless. Even Guilliman and Malcador, who were there at the time, feel bad for Lorgar and Malcador <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even claims that if he could have saved any of the Traitor Primarchs it would have been Lorgar, even though Lorgar nearly crippled him at said incident.</span> Lorgar just wanted to give humanity faith, he really believed that it would make humanity happier and better for it. And when he finally does find the Gods he always believed in, they aren't quite what he expected...
</li><li> Konrad Curze. The Night Haunter. One of the most pitiable of the Primarchs. Raised on a world where the most common cause of death was suicide, he was not taken in by a family or a mentor, he raised himself and brought his world to compliance through fear. Cursed all his life with seeing the future he knew from an early age how he would die, and when the Emperor did come for him Curze took the Emperor's compliments on Nostramo as proof that his methods were correct. Eventually he could not be tolerated any more and the Emperor chastised him, and then Curze saw what was to come. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A vision of the Heresy, and as the only Primarch who he considered a friend Fulgrim was the first person he told, and Fulgrim's first act was to tell the others. Rogal Dorn called Curze out for his slander and in a fit of madness Curze nearly beat him to death, and was condemned for it. Escaping he returns home and finds that Nostramo has reverted to what it once was, and he decides that only destruction will end the cycle of sin.</span> Eventually he allows himself to be assassinated to end his miserable life and to prove that the Emperor is little different from him.
</li><li> Perturabo. The Iron Lord. Perturabo is one of the most tragic of the Primarchs, for his treachery was entirely preventable if only somebody had taken an interest in him as a human being. Raised by a cold and tyrannical ruler who thought of Perturabo more as an heir than a son, eventually Perturabo met the Emperor and had a chance to really come into his own. It was not to be. He legion was saddled with garrison and siege duties all across the galaxy in small numbers guarding massive populations in hellhole conditions once the Emperor realised how talented he and the Iron Warriors were at such styles of warfare, and his only dream <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> of creating wondrous and beautiful buildings, cities and works of architecture solely for the joy of it, and not for glory or rulership</span>, was never realised as nobody ever cared enough to ask him what his dreams were. His dedication was put to the test when he had to reign in his own rebelling homeworld. He and his legion massacred the rebeling population and realized there was no possibility of atonement. He sided with Horus for that, and for one reason, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Horus was the only one who had never lied to him or betrayed him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Artemis Entreri is a ruthless assassin that has done his fair share of atrocities over the series progression, but seeing his upbringing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSellswords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSellswords">The Sellswords</a></em> does a great deal in explaining how he came to be how he is. His mother was a prostitute, his supposed father abused him and his uncle molested him as a boy, before his mother sold him to a pedohile merchant. No wonder he grew up to be a cynic.
</li><li> Captain Bligh in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBountyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBountyTrilogy">The Bounty Trilogy</a>. He is shown to be a complete bastard, cruel and vindictive towards his underlings. After the mutiny, he is shown in the lifeboat, taking care of the men who joined him. He prays for their safety and gives the bird they killed to the weakest man in the boat. He proves himself a masterful sailor. He and most of the crew survive and reach shore where Bligh regains command of another ship. He then becomes cruel and vindictive again, but the scenes showing him in the lifeboat gave another side that added the slightest respectability to the character.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Bligh was no worse or better than most captains of his day, and he did, in fact, manage to sail that small open boat thousands of miles to safety, saving the lives of his crew who went with him. Meanwhile, back on Pitcairn, things were... less than rosy between Fletcher Christian, his fellow mutineers, and their Tahitian companions.

Buffy, determined to allow her friends <em>one</em> unspoiled moment in high school, corners the culprit and angrily demands to know why someone would want to destroy "the happiest night of the year". The culprit sneers that he has his reasons — and we're treated to a brief flashback of him shyly and politely asking a girl to go to the prom with him, only for the girl to cruelly reject him. This is played entirely for laughs.

But both Jessica and the audience feel just a <em>little</em> sympathy for him as it's revealed that his powers are the result of his parents subjecting him to extremely painful experiments as a kid to save his life (as he was born with a terminal brain disease). Not only that, but they at one point abandoned him while he was still a child after he started using his newly-manifested powers to punish them when he was upset. From then on he used his powers to compel strangers to feed, clothe, and protect him since his parents were not there to do it for him. Despite it likely being a manipulative bid for sympathy, Kilgrave defends his actions in an argument with Jessica of her having been held captive by him by claiming that the nature of his powers makes it impossible for him to determine if people do things for him because they want to, or because they are compelled to. Jessica herself even dresses down Kilgraves parents, telling them that he may have been a little monster child with a terrifying ability, but he was their son and they failed him by abandoning their responsibilities to teach him to be better.

Though she uses it to kill <em>him</em> instead, there is a moment toward the end of the episode in which she looks over his dead body with what looks like regret, and one recalls that, at the end of everything, they were still siblings and <em>did</em>, in fact, love each other long ago.

But Eddie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">"Latino temper"</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">pathological ego complex</a>, and his penchant for violence and sadistic cruelty all eventually combined to turn him into a monster during the summer of 2005; he stalked, tormented, and outright terrorized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> for months, all because he couldn't beat Mysterio in singles competition. When Mysterio finally defeated Guerrero for the final time in a Ladder Match, and Guerrero's wife Vickie left him (for the second time) and he lost custody forever of his (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>) biological son, Dominic, a borderline-deranged Eddie appeared shortly afterward in a promo delivered in English and partly in Spanish, warning Mysterio that, now that he had "lost everything" and had no more reason to live and thus no motivation for preserving his dignity, he was now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">more dangerous than ever</a> and Rey and Dominic were not safe from him anywhere. This angle was dropped very quickly when Guerrero abruptly turned face, issuing a blanket apology for everything he'd done and challenging for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>'s World Heavyweight Championship — and although, if not for his death in November of that year, he was to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">successfully betrayed Batista for the title</a>, Eddie Guerrero did at least manage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself">Die As Himself</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Rey Mysterio dedicated his Royal Rumble Match victory to him, and within months he was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.</a>

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a> backstory helped: he was a lifelong fan of WWE hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and perhaps the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a>, and did spend some time as a fan favorite before the disappointment of not being able to win a WWE title after being in the company for over half a decade finally got to him. Also, especially compared to the more detestable heels, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFunnyToBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFunnyToBeEvil">funny and charming even when behaving his worst</a>, and almost always smiling (even if it was often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a>), so you felt you could forgive just about anything he did. There's also the fact that he rarely actually <em>cheated</em> to win his matches, tending to rely instead on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. Edge was perhaps seen at his most sympathetic-as-a-heel in 2008, when he was engaged to marry then-<em>SmackDown</em> General Manager Vickie Guerrero (whom he truly loved, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeningSweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeningSweethearts">a little ickily so</a>); when Edge was caught kissing the wedding planner on the day of their wedding, he was truly sorry, tearfully begging forgiveness of an unmerciful Vickie, who punished him by putting him in a literally life-threatening Hell in a Cell Match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, whom she had reinstated after having fired him (a wee hypocritical, since Edge <em>and</em> Vickie had conspired to antagonize Undertaker, and in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">'Taker turned his wrath on Vickie once he was done with Edge</a>). It was easy to think of Edge as a desperate-to-reform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrViceGuy">Mr. Vice Guy</a>, and Undertaker's act of <em>literally sending him to Hell</em> at the end of their match (though Edge of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">managed to escape a few months later</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">certainly seemed extreme</a>.
</li><li> Over the years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> has tended to fill this role on those occasions when he's been a heel. Sure, he is by nature a violent, misanthropic "monster"...but considering all the injustices that have been committed against him since he was a boy, it's hard to blame him. He was badly burned in a fire started by his half-brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, when they were kids, being left so traumatized that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless">wasn't able to talk</a> <em>for years</em>. He was betrayed by two of his girlfriends (one of whom was actually his wife at the time) and unjustly accused of murdering and violating the corpse of a third. He was bullied by Evolution into removing his mask on national television, finally revealing his burned face to the world and (semi-)permanently going insane as a result. He was tricked into killing his own father (by Edge, who <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">was a face at the time</a></em>). And, to top it off, he never seemed to be able to beat Undertaker, the man who was responsible for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> in the first place...which made it a sort of perverse but awesome moment when, in the autumn of 2010, Kane finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">defeated his heretofore-omnipotent brother</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">three consecutive times</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em>. If you miss the first 15 minutes of the play, Richard is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, unrepentant in what he's done, and deserving of all the hatred and scorn he receives. If you DO see the first bit, however, and pay close attention, something stays with you for the entirety of the play:
<div class="indent"><em>"Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, <br/>Have no delight to pass away the time, <br/>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun <br/>And descant on mine own deformity: <br/>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, <br/>To entertain these fair well-spoken days, <br/>I am determined to prove a villain <br/>And hate the idle pleasures of these days."</em>
</div><ul><li> And then, in the very next scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> lets us see Richard successfully woo Anne, suggesting that Richard's deformity wasn't his <em>reason</em> for villainy, just his <em>excuse.</em>
</li><li> Shakespeare was pretty good at these: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Thane of Cawdor</a> is an utter bastard, but still a sympathetic character, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">King Claudius</a> has that one scene where you can almost feel bad for him.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bond/Sondheim portrayal of Sweeney Todd, to the extent where you're pretty much a cold, heartless jerk if you <em>don't</em> sympathise with him. Several songs in the musical are this trope.
</li><li> This is probably one of the biggest themes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a>: The Musical</em>. Not only does it get the audience to see from the 'villain's' point of view, but in turn points the finger at society for being such a bitch to one poor, different person.
</li><li> Shylock, the Jewish moneylender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>, has (partly as a result of changing mores) been depicted even more sympathetically than he was during the play's time, and he was already portrayed somewhat sympathetically at the time. It's at least implied at the end that, though Shylock has been humiliated, his <em>soul</em> will find redemption - even if that point is made in a pretty blunt and cruel way.
</li><li> Webber's <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> was made to play to this trope. The Phantom spends the entire play killing, manipulating, extorting, and terrorizing people in pursuit of his goals, but the audience is repeatedly reminded that it is the severe isolation brought on by his physical deformity that drives him to behave this way. He even pauses in the middle of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a> to confess to Christine that even his own mother 'loathed' him because of his face. There's rarely a dry eye in the house at this point in the show.

Once you defeat him, you find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was a little boy whose entire family was killed, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">I should have died with them</a>".

When you beat him, you get the chance to execute him. Not only is he suddenly very honourable about it, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">picking this choice will make his daughter, Queen Anora, object. Then Loghain kindly hushes her and tells her it's over. When she tells him she's not a child anymore, Loghain says: "Daughters never grow up, Anora. They remain six year olds with pigtails and skinned knees forever." Suddenly, he's transformed from Big Bad to loving father. If you use him for the DLC content after the main quest he has tons of these, especially in Return to Ostagar where he can present a decent argument for why he retreated.</span>
</li><li> Killing Jamie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell: Double Agent</a></em>, due to his loyalty and genuine friendship with Sam. After your cover is blown, while you're sneaking up on him you'll hear him insisting that Sam isn't a traitor and pleading to B.J. to give him another chance. If you grab him and interrogate him, he'll insist that he knows Sam too well for him to be a traitor, and Sam coldly replies that he didn't know him at all. Sam kills him without a second thought, but to the audience it's a <em>serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a></em>. However, it is also an arguable question, knowing that Jamie is a terrorist, responsible for many bad things just like the rest of the organization.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jamie</strong> <em>(Before being fatally stabbed)</em>: See? I knew you wouldn't do it... I knew you were on our side.

Then the music abruptly turns ominous and cuts to scenes of the cult arriving, the villagers being experimented on and becoming ganados, and even a woman carelessly standing next to her child or maybe even body of it (it may be even possible that she killed a child). It's remembered as the most terrifying part of the game, and that's saying a lot.

In the prequel, <em>Crisis Core,</em> however, the character's origins as a heroic member of SOLDIER are explored. He still comes off as aloof, but has a more human side, and maintains real friendships with Genesis and Angeal. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">revelations</a> about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">true nature</a> are detailed in more depth than in the original game, and though it doesn't excuse his later actions, it's hard not to feel sorry for him in those moments.

In that game, she has numerous lines that heavily imply she longs for the innocent and happy days of her childhood, and moreso, that this longing is the actual driving force behind everything she does (this is even the point of her final speech to Squall, and the final text speech you get if you don't beat her as Squall in Shade Impulse). This motivation was apparently present originally in FFVIII, but was removed in the english port. For some reason, the writers for Dissidia Duodecim thought this was an excellent idea, as the rewrites for the 13th cycle in that game remove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">absolutely every trace of this aspect of her character</a>, leaving a single line to Terra as the only hint of this part of her personality.

She was the first summoner to defeat Sin - with her beloved husband sacrificing himself to facilitate it. Unfortunately the process killed her and she is forced to remain in Zanarkand as an unsent - where she greets other summoners looking to do the same. Although she helps continue this tradition of lies, she does so because she wishes to bring (false!) hope to the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her final words</span> are lamenting that the people now have no hope.

Though clearly Doman herself, she is sadistic and hateful and her only goal in life seems to be making every Doman as miserable as possible.

Then her aunt and uncle took her in, but were abusive towards her day in and day out. They deliberately sabotaged any chance she had of joining the Garlean military while actively making sure their son was chosen. Then they married her off to a physically abusive drunk for money. When he died, they sold her into prostitution. The owner of the whorehouse could see that she didn't deserve to be there, but since her beauty attracted a lot of customers, he pimped her out anyway.</span> At the end of the campaign in Doma, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she loses her memory after Doma Castle collapses on her and Gosetsu, and because of this, Gosetsu starts treating her like a daughter, with actual kindness.

But in the final battle with her, she really just feels that she has gone too far and caused too much suffering to be redeemed, so she throws herself into a battle with the Warrior of Light she knows she will lose. She is at least able to kill her foster brother as her last act before dying, having now killed all of the agents of her suffering.</span>

When it turned out that the plague was infesting him through his powers, his own brother tried to murder him, accidentally killed his wife, and erased him from history after he disappeared. He was woken up after centuries, only to be hounded by assassins from Lucis, the country founded by the brother who stole everything from him. A mad scientist tried to be his friend, but mainly by egging on his worst traits and indulging in unethical sciences. Then he looked into the mind of a god he once worshipped and discovered how little they care about humanity in general, pushing him over the edge into becoming a supervillain. And after that, he devours the minds of his enemies - the narration states that the minds of other humans were what eroded what remained of his sanity, not the minds of the millions of demons he merged with. And the kicker? The reason why he succeeded in destroying the world <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was because Bahamut intentionally granted him healing powers to make him a supervillain in the first place, all to ensure continued worship of the gods through a scripted war between light and dark.

The bonus episode "Noximilien" is entirely made of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, he finally achieves his goal and rewinds time, hoping to save his family and undo all the horrible things he's done over the last two hundred years... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">and it only goes back twenty minutes</a>. All the atrocities he's forced himself to commit, all the struggle he's caused, all the pain everyone's suffered, rendered completely pointless. He's so broken by this he goes to the graves of his family and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">kills himself</a>. And because the world never knew about his motives, he'll go down in history as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">Generic Doomsday Villain</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> doesn't even <em>begin</em> to cover it.</span>
