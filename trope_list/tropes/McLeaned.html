</div></div><p>TV Industry jargon: When an actor leaves a show, and the character they play is then killed off for good, they've been McLeaned. As for why a TV show might do this rather than simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">putting the character on a bus</a>, there are generally two reasons:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> <strong>For Drama</strong>: The odds of the actor returning to the show are next to nil, and killing them off gives the writers a chance to inject the series with some drama.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>For Revenge</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostilityOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostilityOnTheSet">Relations between the actor and the show people are somewhat contentious</a>, often as a direct result of the actor leaving, and the writers kill the character off either as an act of "revenge" more final than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell">Putting Them On A Bus To Hell</a>, or as a way of preventing the actor from ever being able to return to the role (though it could still fail to do so if the situation changes, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfResurrection">First Law of Resurrection</a>).
</li></ul><p>The trope is named for McLean Stevenson, and the death of his character Colonel Henry Blake after he left <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>. This event was not primarily about retaliation, although the production staff was annoyed by Stevenson's leaving even while co-star Wayne Rogers was wriggling out of his own contract.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nneg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nneg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nneg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, Rogers' character, "Trapper" John McIntyre, was merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, being sent home between seasons, despite Rogers leaving on worse terms with more animosity between him and the production staff.</span> The main reason was to bring home the idea that war can take anyone at any time and to evoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">a strong and unrehearsed response from the cast</a>, most of whom would first hear of the character's fate minutes before the scene was being shot. This isn't to say that the exact <em>manner</em> of Blake's death wasn't just a bit vindictive.

When it happens off-screen (especially after the character was already written out in a non-deadly manner), it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">Bus Crash</a>. If the actor specifically requested to be killed off rather than written out in some less permanent way, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledByRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledByRequest">Killed by Request</a>.
</p><p>If the actor has not simply left the show, but life altogether, then this becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">The Character Died with Him</a> and the way the character is written out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">is generally very respectful</a>.

</li><li> Nurse Mary Lamont, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrKildare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrKildare">Dr. Kildare</a>'s Wedding Day</em> (1941). Laraine Day, who'd played the character in several films, told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM">MGM</a> she was tired of the role and asked to be written out of the series. So they had her die in a car accident after marrying Kildare.
</li><li> This wound up happening <em>twice</em> to Laurie Strode in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Halloween</a></em> films.
<ul><li> First, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> (by then a successful 'mainstream' actress) declined to return for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween4TheReturnOfMichaelMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween4TheReturnOfMichaelMyers">Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers</a></em>, Laurie was written out and mentioned as having died in a car accident.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater">Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later</a></em> declared everything after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981">the second film</a> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">non-canon</a>, they were able to bring Curtis back to reprise her role as Laurie... on the condition that it be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>. Since longtime <em>Halloween</em> producer Moustapha Akkad's contract barred him from letting the writers permanently kill off Michael Myers, this naturally led to a sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection">Halloween: Resurrection</a></em>. Curtis, who was contractually obligated to appear in the film and was not at all happy about that, insisted that Laurie be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome">in the opening</a>. The producers obliged this request, and thus a new protagonist named Sarah was used for the film after Lauries death.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a>'s character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>, Steven Hiller, died in an accident with the alien-tech fighter jets before the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence">Independence Day: Resurgence</a></em>. (Will Smith didn't want another Sci-Fi Father-Son story after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth">After Earth</a></em>.)
</li><li> In a very odd version of this trope, with the character's creator being the reason for a character's humiliating death rather than the actor leaving acrimoniously, the bad blood between Kevin McClorry and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> producers caused them to kill off Blofeld...by dropping him down a factory smokestack.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack3">Men in Black 3</a></em>, it's mentioned near the beginning that Zed had passed away, and the other characters attend a memorial service. The reason Zed was killed off was that actor Rip Torn had been arrested for drunk driving. And also broke into a bank with a loaded firearm. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21usk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21usk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21usk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Despite this, however, Torn did appear in the film, albeit under heavy makeup and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncreditedRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncreditedRole">uncredited</a> as one of the aliens at Zed's funeral </span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> is the last film on the contracts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDowneyJr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> (Iron Man) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisEvans">Chris Evans</a> (Captain America) for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.

However, about 25 years later she changed her mind and returned in her most iconic role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorDarkFate">Terminator: Dark Fate</a></em>, a heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">time-skipped</a> but direct sequel to <em>Judgment Day</em> that renders all other instalments from <em>Rise of the Machines</em> onward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">non-canon</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XXxStateOfTheUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XXxStateOfTheUnion">xXx: State of the Union</a></em> has Augustus Gibbons calmly acknowledge the news of Xander Cage's death and then nobody mentions him for the rest of the film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated">This has been retconned now that Vin Diesel reprised his role</a>.

Both their characters were effectively murdered, closing the door on future-season guest spots. The former appeared briefly in the season finale, which served as a character sendoff.
</li><li> Eric Balfour had only signed up the sixth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, and since it was already planned for the following season to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a> that was going to get rid of most of the characters anyway, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledByRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledByRequest">asked the producers to kill him off</a>. This led to his character Milo getting shot in the face late in the season.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestBorgnine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestBorgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> left <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf">Airwolf</a></em>, the writers decided to kill off his character by way of showing Ernest's stunt double - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">filmed only from behind, natch</a> - being killed in a helicopter explosion (using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">an entirely different episode, filmed in an entirely different location</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>: this was just barely averted in the case of Carroll O'Connor. Contract disputes with O'Connor led to Archie being absent for a number of episodes during the fifth season - in case they weren't able to reach a negotiation, an episode where it was discovered that Archie had been murdered was filmed which would have led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a> of the series.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a> in question would have involved Archie's best friend, the frequently-mentioned but rarely-seen Jerome "Stretch" Cunningham, moving in with the Bunkers to look after them in Archie's memory and becoming the show's new lead. Stretch was played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCromwell">James Cromwell</a>, who much later revealed that his own character's death was for revenge. Understandably, O'Connor wasn't thrilled with the continued on-set presence of the man who very nearly replaced him, and demanded to the producers that he be fired; they acquiesced, and the show got a classic episode out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArchieBunkersPlace">Archie Bunker's Place</a></em>: After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em> ended, the writers struggled to explain Edith Bunker's constant absence in the spinoff. Eventually they wrote an episode entitled "Archie Alone" that explains that Edith had died of a stroke, and Archie was actively in denial and trying to keep news of her death from reaching his friends. This was for drama, as Jean Stapleton merely wanted to pursue other options instead of returning to occasionally guest star as her sitcom character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> Andrea Thompson, who played the telepath Talia Winters, got a bit demanding on the set. Notably, she wanted to appear in more episodes than she was, in fact in more episodes than most of the regular cast but the lead. She left the show in the ensuing discussions, and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">taken back to Psi Corps headquarters</a> by Bester. In a later episode, Al Bester lets slip that they found out things about the crew in the course of her debriefing and dissec...er <em>examination</em>. This one's notable in that Talia was always intended, right from the start to be sent back to Psi Corps. They even wrote in the mechanism that would enable her to return. The only thing that changed is that unlike the original plan, she never came back. This show is somewhat unusual in that there was always a ready plan to do this to any of the main characters, should the need arise.
</li><li> This was also done with the recurring character General Hague. He had played a major role in season 2, and it was anticipated he would show up in a major episode of season 3. When that episode was about to be taped, he was unavailable. Because of the circumstances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> killed off General Hague—partly out of vindictiveness and partly to add drama — and put Hague's subordinate in charge. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousOuttakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousOuttakes">Hilarious Outtake</a> puts the situation best:

The writers eventually got fed up with this and killed off his character. Unfortunately, because the build-up of the third leg in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, involving Billy's love interest (Dee) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> (Apollo), kept ending up as deleted scenes, this came across to many viewers as an especially abrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a> in favor of the pretty boy over the awkward geek; with Dee dumping him out of nowhere and suddenly jumping into a relationship with Apollo all in the same episode where Billy got shot (perhaps marking the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a> which grew for Dee's character).

In the end it turned out to be academic, as the mooted fifth season never happened.
</li><li> Speaking of the finale, the series ends with the characters being shot in slow-motion. The actors were told that if they wanted to stay on for the next season, their character would be stunned and if they didn't, then their character's dead.

<ul><li> With the original series, rumors abounded about Robert Reed's status on the show after the end of Season 5, after he refused to appear in the season finale, "The Hair-Brained Scheme." That, plus his ongoing feud with Sherwood Schwartz and his son, Lloyd, and overall unhappiness with the show meant that, according to several sources, including the book <em>Growing Up Brady</em> by Barry Williams (Greg), Reed was about to be fired, and one of the scenarios seriously considered to explain Reed's departure was killing off Mike Brady. The aversion came when ABC stepped in and decided to fire everybody.
</li><li> With <em>The Bradys</em>, Reed's feud with the Schwartzes continued unabated, and when the Schwartzes got wind that a frustrated Reed was complaining directly to CBS about the scripts, Sherwood Schwartz and Paramount Studios considered that a serious breach of protocol. Williams wrote that had the series been renewed for the fall 1990 season, Reed would definitely not be asked back ... and again, killing his character off was among the scenarios that were on the table. There was a scenario where Mike, who had gotten into politics and been elected City Councilman, was going to go up in a helicopter to check out the damage to his district after an earthquake, only for the chopper to crash.

<ul><li> A show in which every major character has been killed, some as many as nine times over eight years (including Prue once, she was brought back by a genie), explained that Prue was "dead for good" when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty">Shannen Doherty</a> was kicked off the show.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> for Prue's unavailability is that her death is still too recent for her sisters.

You're left to your own opinion about the artistic choices, but there was no hint of antagonism between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Benz</span> and the Dexter crew, and she's made at least one flashback appearance so it's a pretty clear "drama" McLeaning. It certainly was dramatic. <br/>The writers confirmed in an interview just after that finale that she was saddened by the news and definitely didn't want to leave, but understood why it was necessary plot-wise and handled it graciously. She then went on to poke fun at herself on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSoup">The Soup</a></em>, pretending to be drunk and bitter about getting canned, but then getting a phone call with an offer to replace the lead on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> because the first actor (Joel McHale) sucked so much.

The character was a fixture in the setting and Martin's life, so killing her off was probably the most plausible explanation for her sudden disappearance.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame">Fame</a></em> had one of the more unusual examples.

Around the same time, Nia Peeples (who played the role of Nicole Chapman) was planning to depart to launch a music career, and Peeples agreed to have the writers kill off her character... which they did (and according to the 2009 book <em>Inside Fame on Television</em>, they regretted doing so later).
</li><li> The character Zhaan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> died because her actress developed health problems due to the makeup they used, as well as several other outstanding issues.

John Kapelos was offered a scenario of Schanke making captain, but he didn't want reduced screen time. In season 3, more characters died, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> scenario.
</li><li> An in-show example takes place on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>. In a parody of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A.

Years later, Joey was able to return to the show as Dr. Drake Ramoray when the character played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>'s character was killed off in the McLean manner as well (in a horse-riding accident, even though the character was established to be afraid of horses), and according to soap-opera logic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Drake received her brain</a> and fully recovered. By the next "episodes", the brain transplant thing was dropped.
</li><li> A rare cameo example: Singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> as "Eddie" in the premiere of Season 7. Though the character was never intended to return, the Fandom's reaction was so negative that his fate is mentioned offhandedly by prostitutes in Season 8: His face melted off by dragon fire.
</li><li> When John Amos was fired from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes">Good Times</a></em> in 1975 for complaining about the quality of the show in <em>Ebony</em> magazine, his character James Evans was promptly killed in yet another auto accident (this one was particularly tragic, since James was planning on moving to Mississippi).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em> used this for maximum emotional impact when the <em>de facto</em> male lead Josh Charles wanted to leave. Although the writers initially considered writing his character, Will Gardner, out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">having the ethically challenged attorney disbarred</a>, they instead killed him off when his unhinged client went on a shooting spree in their courtroom, about two-thirds of the way through Season 5. Between killing off arguably the most important male character and having no precedent for such violence on the series, it made for quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>.
</li><li> Bart Bass was killed off on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> when actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJohnBurke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJohnBurke">Robert John Burke</a> wanted to leave.

She decided this later and the character was instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>. The finale of Season 8 was intended to be this: a few of the actors had not yet decided to renew their contracts, so there was a plane crash which would allow some characters to easily be killed off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">the beginning of the next season</a>.

</li><li> When they brought the show back as <em>Heroes Reborn</em> in 2015, a number of the original actors were unable to return thanks to commitments to other projects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> was among those not to come back, so her character, Claire, was killed off-screen and regulated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous</a> status.

Then Polito said bad things about Tom Fontana and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarryLevinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarryLevinson">Barry Levinson</a>, the show's producers. So they decided to kill Crosetti off instead.

Though this was due to the first reason, not because of any friction with the rest of the cast. They just wanted some drama and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LALaw">L.A. Law</a></em>: Diana Muldaur's departure resulted in her character Rosalind Shays walking into an open elevator shaft. It should be noted that this was not because of dislike of Muldaur, but rather because the writers hated the character, who was very harsh and bitchy, and they thought the character was ruining the show. Alternatively, however, then executive producer David E. Kelley claimed in an "Emmy TV Legends" interview that he actually loved the character very much, and actually had Rosalind killed off because he was actually leaving the series, and he didn't want her to get mishandled in the hands of another writer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>:

Rumor had it that her particularly brutal McLeaning is a result of Annie Parisse, who portrayed her, refusing to sleep with one of the show's writers, but this rumor has been debunked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says she wanted to leave so she could act in more movies, and the reason the writers McLeaned her is because it had been ages since they'd killed off a major cast member (as part of a crime, at least).
</li><li> When Jill Hennessey left the show, prosecutor Claire Kincaid was killed by a drunk driver hitting her car in the driver's door. This is a particularly interesting case, though, since the producers originally intended to have the character merely paralyzed, but changed it to killing her off when Hennessey refused to return for one more episode that would show this.
<ul><li> Kincaid's death was a result of miscommunication; Jill Hennessey claimed she was perfectly happy to reprise her role and was rather shocked to hear they actually killed off Kincaid. When the original series was still broadcasting, Hennessey also stated she wanted to come back to do 'weird flashbacks' but the producers (unfortunately) never took her up on her offer.

Much like on the other versions of <em>L&amp;O</em>, the writers probably wanted to kill off a major character, especially since Bamber was now the third actor to depart the series and the other two had left without much fanfare. It's a pretty classic example of Reason #1 — the following episode was one of the series best as the team struggled to deal with their grief while doing their best to ensure that his killer was brought to justice. Still, one wishes it would have occurred to the writers that this would be the umpteenth of Bamber's characters to be killed off and find another way to write him out.

</li><li> Caesar seemed to be an important character and was advertised as such, then was killed abruptly on his fourth episode without contributing anything critical to the plot. It was done because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaidTaghmaoui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaidTaghmaoui">Saïd Taghmaoui</a> decided not to stay for the next season and the planned character arc was apparently passed on to Bram, who debuted just minutes after Caesar met his demise.
</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mira Furlan</span> wanted to leave the US, they killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danielle</span> off. However, it sounds like her character wouldn't have survived season 4 anyway: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alex</span>'s resulting death was very important to the plot and <em>was</em> planned, so apparently she was just killed off earlier than they had originally planned, before she could get a long-awaited centric episodes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though the events of it were placed into season 5</span>.

Lane's death was admittedly the result of Jared Harris deciding he had to leave in order to honour his other acting commitments, particularly playing Professor Moriarty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows">Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</a></em>, and the writers and Harris agreeing that the series could continue without Lane (his financial/management wizardry role being transferred to Joan). There were also no bad blood between him and the production, as he returned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectedByCastMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectedByCastMember">direct</a> the 7th season Episode <em>Time &amp; Life</em>.

This was done as a sort of parody of the trope, and not out of any real bitterness - Trace continues to be good friends with much of the cast, including his Crow replacement Bill Corbett, to this day. They were able to set this one up in advance since they knew Beaulieu would be leaving; the finale of Season 7 has Forrester get turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">star child</a> and his mother gushing over being given a second chance to raise him right.

However, on her way to the airport, she was in a car accident and died. This was quite a surprising twist when it originally aired in the US. For some reason, the Australian station on which the OC was playing felt that instead of allowing the viewers to experience this shock twist, it should start having ads three weeks before the finale saying "MARISSA...WILL...DIE". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">Thanks, channel 10</a>.

Getting out of <em>Sliders</em> was almost as bad as staying <em>in</em>. Rhys-Davies was reportedly disgusted with the direction the show was taking, but he didn't want to leave, nor did he ever express total opposition to coming back. His departure was as much because the production staff (as led by David Peckinpah) loathed Rhys-Davies for his constant criticism. Rhys-Davies' story (he was credited as co-author) was greatly altered from its original version to the point where it's barely recognizable. While not naming names, Rhys-Davies did not ever want to work with a certain executive producer ever again and it was Peckinpah that stayed with the show until its end.

As early as the second episode, the show had established the fact that any character could be killed at any time - which makes for exciting viewing, because it neatly averts the "main characters are always safe" trope.
<ul><li> Specifically, when the actress who played Fiona Carter had to leave due to pregnancy, she was kidnapped, tortured and then shot trying to escape. She died in her husband's arms.
</li><li> The actor who played Fiona Carter's husband later decided to move on. He was blown up by a car bomb.

<ul><li> Tasha Yar was killed off by a sentient oil slick when Denise Crosby left near the end of the first season. Although her character came back twice in later episodes, both times were due to time travel; the "original" Tasha was gone for good. On the <em>other</em> hand, it turned out she had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">identical half-Romulan daughter</a> who served as a recurring villain, so the actress managed to come back a few times anyway.

One reason the famous "Best of Both Worlds" cliffhanger at the end of season three was created was because it was unknown if he would renew his contract at the time, and thus this allowed things so that Picard could be killed instantly in the fourth season's premiere.

She does return for a flashback sequence on season 3 though, so it's assumed that Golightly and the writers parted in good terms.
<ul><li> Happened twice in season 3B. The Carver Twins were leaving the show, so the writers killed off Aiden and had Ethan leave town out of grief. More shocking was Crystal Reed's departure after playing one of the lead characters (Allison Argent) since Season 1. She gave the writer fair warning and co-wrote her own death scene, which as well as being a dramatic moment in itself will seem to have repercussions for the other characters in Season 4.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>, the original Stig (played by Perry McCarthy). According to McCarthy, when his contract wasn't going to be renewed, they agreed to have the Stig go out with a bang "as much like a scene out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> as possible." See the scene <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4x0Dz00csA">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the show's official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel. Unusually for this trope, when the <em>replacement</em> Stig left the show on exceedingly bad terms with the rest of the team, breaking his non-disclosure agreement to write a tell-all book in which he said some very unflattering things about the other presenters, this trope was completely averted; although they did refer to him as "Sacked Stig" and shot up cardboard effigies of him in one special, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">put someone else in the costume</a> the following series and, soon after "New Stig"'s debut, proceeded as if nothing had happened.

As a result, the series was instead wrapped up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleMovie">Finale Movie</a> titled <em>Musicale Finale</em>, where Maura Pfefferman was killed off and the rest of the family was shown dealing with her death.
</li><li> After his tumultuous exit, and his subsequent media war with producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckLorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckLorre">Chuck Lorre</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a>'s character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen">Two and a Half Men</a></em> met a very permanent end. The season opener following Sheen's exit opened at Sheen's character's funeral, with the cast discussing his demise. Sheen's character was honeymooning in Paris when his new wife caught him with another woman in the shower. He got chased into the Metro, "slipped," and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious">ended up as a "meat explosion"</a>. As it is an American sitcom, the "explosion" occurred off-screen. Just to rub it in, the rest of the episode was spent giving Charlie the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">Chef</a> treatment, making fun of his corpse, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshesToCrashes">wacky sitcom shenanigans with his ashes</a>, and the girl who very obviously murdered Charlie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">getting away with it unscathed</a>.
<ul><li> The series finale took it a step further. Charlie, it turns out, was alive the whole time, kept prisoner by Rose. He escapes and sends threats to Alan and his replacement Walden, while giving away money to the other regulars. In the final moments of the show, Charlie (played by a stand-in seen from behind) approaches the front door... and is crushed to death by a falling piano.

The day after, CW announced it had picked up Cult, starring Matt Davis. Though, once Cult was cancelled, he returned, finally permanently in the Season 5 finale, and as a regular in Season 6.
<ul><li> Interestingly, this also happened with a piece of set. The show lost the lease on the house used for the Gilbert house, so in the show, it was burned down.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, Dale was killed off after Jeffrey DeMunn requested to leave when showrunner Frank Darabont was axed.

At some point, he was removed from Shakespeare's theatrical company, perhaps having had a falling-out with either Shakespeare or Richard Burbage.

<ul><li> Bill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> died shortly before the events of "The Passing" DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve</a> had previously been unable to get his voice actor back to record new lines for the earlier <em>Crash Course</em> DLC (which the character appeared in, alive). Jim French (the voice actor) is a radio personality and was too busy to record lines for Valve. Seeing as Valve was unable to get new lines twice due to the VA's unreliability, they, unfortunately, decided to kill off the character.
<ul><li> He came back, however, for "The Sacrifice", but since it was too late the result is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a> moment where someone makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. (Canonically, he's the one to do it.)

Thus, in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, as you learn in an e-mail, he dies heroically when a turian communications relay falls under attack by the Reapers and Reegar and his squad sacrifice themselves to save the relay. Morinth gets a less dignified death: her voice actress, Natalia Cigliuti, was also unavailable for any more recorded lines, so her appearance in <em>Mass Effect 3</em> amounts to a single e-mail. She's eventually brainwashed into a Banshee by the Reapers, and Shepard must kill her during the final mission on Earth.

Then her voice actress moved to Japan shortly after. There were plans to bring the character back, but due to this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastStraw">the latest in a long line of VA-related issues with the character</a>, they simply left her dead. However Narusasu returned to the US in June 2013, so Momoka once again has the chance to return.
</li><li> A relatively common occurrence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> if a character's handler disappears and nobody is available or willing to adopt them: the administration staff simply takes over and roleplays the character's death through whatever means is available, from being killed in self-defense to being murdered by a killer to suicide to various accidents (including, infamously, running into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">bear</a> in a cave).
</li><li> Parodied in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradJones">Brad and Jerrid</a>. Jerrid was replaced with Brad's friend Brian due to real life matters, and Brad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading">lampshades this</a> by way of complaining about Bewitched and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a>.

<ul><li> After Brad severed ties with Jake Norvell, one half of the "Bros" duo (Who were played by Brad and Jake) appears in Snob's review of <em>Crippled Avengers</em> grieving over the death of the bro played by Jake, and then in <em>Heaven's Gate</em> interviewing replacement bros, settling on "Chick Bro", played by Sarah Lewis.

The character's death was written in from the start of the script, but after filming the actor decided to leave to explore other options, and so when he appears again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee">To Boldly Flee</a></em> it's just as a voice and actually is another member of the team doing an imitation of the original actor.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em> has another good example. Stacy Cornbred, the somewhat ditzy interviewer, was apparently killed off after her voice actress left the show. How'd they do it? A sudden case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousHumanCombustion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousHumanCombustion">Spontaneous Human Combustion</a>. (Brought on by stress from her contract negotiations, a subtle inside-joke.) In fact, that entire episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">revolved around the possible death of one of the show's personnel</a>; Stacy saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">an ominous message in a ketchup spill</a>, telling her that "one of the Deathmatch people will die tonight".

He either a) quit on his own due his outrage over their parody of Scientology (which seems unlikely, given certain interviews), b) was forced to leave by the Church of Scientology, c) left without his knowledge — someone else (i.e. Scientology) did it for him, or d) his agent used the Scientology episode as an elaborate excuse, the real reason being health issues (Hayes died two years after the episode was made)</span>, Chef joined a club of brainwashed pedophiles, then was burned by a lightning strike, dropped <em>off</em> a bridge, impaled on a large branch, shot multiple times and then had his face and limbs eaten by a mountain lion and a grizzly bear. Only to be later revived as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Darth Chef</a>. While parts of it (the burning and limb-losing mutilation) can be credited as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> parody, it still seems like an over the top retaliation. The episode in question might even be considered a parody of McLeaning, especially since the resolution says not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">to blame Chef for the evil cult driving him crazy</a>. The parody is more obvious in that part of his 'acting crazy' is that every one of his spoken lines are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsDialogue">(poorly) clipped together quotes from previous episodes.</a>
</li><li> The original McLeaning is referenced and parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, in which the Griffins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">become the subject of a reality TV show</a>.
