<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>, the villainous Martians pilot physics-breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">Super Robots</a>, while the heroic Earthlings can only field pathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, which allow the Martians to completely massacre the Earth forces. However, protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Inaho Kaizuka</a> repeatedly dominates the Martians through clever application of physics to exploit weaknesses in the Martian machines, often taking advantage of the Martians' arrogance at their invincibility, and he does this while piloting a basic training unit.
</li><li> The main character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em> herself, Yuri Suzuki. She's a complete weakling physically speaking and can't do a thing when she's being sexually assaulted, but being from the future has its advantages. She is revered as Ishtar because she rode a horse, something that's common nowadays, but in ancient Turkey was unheard of. She also recognized an iron sword and used it against Zuwa, ignoring the other, weaker swords available. Back in the Bronze Age, iron was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, so the fact that she knew what iron was and how effective a weapon it is causes the people to see her as very intelligent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> The only way the inherently much physically weaker humans can survive multiple Titans encounters is to be very, <em>very</em>, <strong>very</strong> skilled.
</li><li> Annie Leonhart nearly effortless tosses both Eren and the much larger Reiner on their asses. Eren is amazed at how strong she is, but Annie explains that she is not that strong. She uses techniques that can turn an opponent's superior size and weight against them.
</li><li> Eren later takes a page from Annie's book against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reiner, in Armored Titan form. He quickly realizes that Reiner's armor makes brute force a non-option, so he starts using Annie's techniques to get the Armored Titan in joint locks and grapples, which <em>are</em> effective even with the armor</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Kaku Kaioh in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler">Baki the Grappler</a></em> series. Was once very physically strong, until he came to believe that this was the superior way to fight, as his strength would fade with age, but skill would not.
</li><li> Any human in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BeetTheVandelBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BeetTheVandelBuster">Beet the Vandel Buster</a></em> capable of threatening a high star Vandel, including the main characters. Slade in particular fits this, he is small but quick, his special weapon is invisible rather than being an obvious representation of power like usual, and he is fond of advanced techniques involving intricate timing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is nearly killed when fighting Beltorze's puppet since Beltorze is just as intelligent a fighter <em>and</em> has a ton of raw power to boot.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BigWindup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BigWindup">Big Windup!</a></em>  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> - Momome points out that despite Tajima's exceptional speed and accuracy, he just doesn't have the build to be a power hitter in baseball. While he has been holding his own so far, there are signs that as the series goes on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he will struggle to progress as a result of this handicap while the other players like Hanai overtake him in usefulness by virtue of their superior power and range</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>, the Black Bulls who don't have large amounts of magic power like aristocrats make up for it:
<ul><li> Finral doesn't have the large magical power of other nobles and his kind nature makes him unable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">Tele-Frag</a>. However, he still makes his rare Spatial Magic useful, quickly creating portals to close large distances, forcibly warp enemies, and help comrades avoid attacks in the midst of battle.
</li><li> As Magna states himself, he doesn't have the large magical power that nobles have, and needs to use his magic wisely as a result. Thus, he uses aim, proper timing, and tricky pitches to make the most of his fireball spells.
</li><li> She tells Noelle that she specializes in magic control, which is seen in how she fights. Her magic isn't powerful, with even her fate manipulation only used for evasion, but she controls her threads to bind enemies and wrap around their wrists and ankles to make them her puppets.
</li><li> Grey's Transformation Magic doesn't have much outright offensive use, but she can use it to change other spells' attributes, essentially making enemies' attacks useless or changing the environment to suit the situation. The guidebook gives her a 3/5 in Magic Amount but a 5/5 in Magic Control.
</li><li> Zora's Trap Magic isn't overtly strong and like other peasants he doesn't have as much mana as nobles. Instead, he uses planning and trickery to make the most out of his counter traps.
</li><li> Nero's Sealing Magic isn't offensively powerful, ranking her a Stage Six in combat ability, but it has a variety of effects like sealing damage and imprisoning enemies that make it very useful.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Mayuri Kurotsuchi is not much of a physical fighter and even admits his zanpakuto works as a motion-sensor to compensate for his poor combat skills. What he <em>is</em> is a brilliant scientist with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> skills on Batman's level. When he does have to fight himself, he proves himself as dangerous as you'd expect from a Captain by countering the opponents' tricks beforehand, using a variety of nasty poisons, setting traps, and generally doing everything possible to win the fight before it even starts. Uryu only manages to defeat him with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> that left him worse off than Mayuri in the long run (Mayuri's self-experimentation meant that he was able to pull himself back together, while Uryu lost his Quincy powers).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, there's a bit where Goku goes back in time and meets Master Roshi's old teacher, Mutaitou. By this point Goku is far stronger than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a>, including having killed the monster that wiped out both the master and all of his dojo except Roshi and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rival">rival</a>, Tsuru. However, when they spar Goku's moves are so reckless and sloppy that Mutaitou manages to counter all his attacks with ease.
</li><li> This was also how his first meeting with Mr. Popo went.
</li><li> Compared to the Saiyans at the beginning of Z Goku was this. Since he was raised on Earth which had weak fighters compared to the rest of the universe, Goku lacked any real strength when Raditz came looking for him. However, Goku was able to sense energy, hide his power, and had great control of his ki, something that surprised Raditz when Goku bended his Kamehameha and powered up at various points.
</li><li> King Kai in a nutshell. When he debuted during the Saiyan Saga he was weaker than Vegeta at the time, and didn't get any stronger. He also trained Goku from weaker than Raditz to way stronger than Nappa in a mere six months, most of the Z Warriors from weaker than Nappa to strong enough to beat the Ginyu Force in <em>a month and half</em>, and invented the Kaio-ken and the Spirit Bomb, two techniques that left in awe even the Gods of Destruction.
</li><li> This trope is the bane of the human protagonists' existence. It's entirely possible that Krillin, Yamcha, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu might be able to keep pace with the Saiyans in terms of actual fighting <em>skill</em>, but the uber-powerful foes the protagonists face mean that the humans typically end up as benchwarmers, or are simply beat up as per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Tenshinhan, Yamcha, and Chaozu faced the Ginyu Force while being trained by King Kai. King Kai's training methods, which were so good they allowed Goku to utterly thrash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Nappa</a> when he returned to Earth, proved just as effective for the humans in that it allowed them to keep pace with Freeza's elite troops, and come out on top.
<ul><li> The reason this rarely works in Dragon Ball is because generally powerful characters are simply incapable of being harmed by anything that isn't at least somewhat close to their power level. They will just laugh it off. Even if a weaker opponent has the skill to get around their defense and hit them 100 times before they can react it doesn't matter, because none of the those 100 blows will hurt them. Krillin struggled to hurt Vegeta when Vegeta was deliberately standing there wide open so Krillin could injure him so he'd require healing because Vegeta was that much stronger.
</li><li> When it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">ki attacks</a>, it's the humans among the protagonists that have the creative attacks with special properties (geometry-breaking beams that can be supercharged with life energy, remote controlled projectiles that can turn on a dime, ki <em>buzzsaws</em> that seem to be able to metaphorically punch well above their weight class), while the Saiyans mostly just have increasingly large orbs and lasers to throw around. It's not always enough to even the power gap, but sometimes the results can be surprising...
</li></ul></li><li> Piccolo gets this during the fight on Namek with Frieza. Though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> was slightly lower than Frieza's even after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fusion with Nail</a>, Piccolo's fighting skills nonetheless allow him to go toe-to-toe with Frieza's second form.
</li><li> <em>Vegeta</em>, of all people, gets this treatment more than once:
<ul><li> In his second battle with Zarbon he found out that, even with the recent Zenkai boost, he was still weaker than his opponent. However he was a battle hardened fighter and Zarbon had grown rusty due being around Frieza for years, so Vegeta managed to get around his defenses and land <em>two</em> crippling blows. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> ensues.
</li><li> During his fight with Recoome, Vegeta showed much more skill than his opponent... And not enough power to actually hurt him, something Recoome mocked him for.
</li><li> When dealing with Perfect Cell, Vegeta found himself just as outmatched in terms of power as he had been against Recoome, something Cell mocked him for just like Recoome. Then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">much to Cell's horror</a>, Vegeta revealed the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugdge3Cn9L0">Final Flash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and nearly <em>killed him</em>-Cell had to dodge, and even then he received what would have been crippling damage against anyone without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">his immense regenerative power</a>.
</li><li> After Vegeta was defeated by Cell, Trunks stepped in with his newly revealed Ultra Super Saiyan form, powerful enough to overcome Cell... But too slow to actually <em>hit</em> him, in addition to drain his energy and stamina far faster than normal. Cell promptly revealed that Vegeta could have done it too, he just hadn't bothered because, being far more skilled than Trunks, he had not needed to use it in combat to notice the drawbacks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em>, he has the best showing against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Beerus</a> because of his good fighting sense, outperforming the far stronger SSJ3 Goku, Gohan, and Gotenk. Beerus even laments that he's "highly skilled, but lacks the power to match it."
</li></ul></li><li> Gohan (who could be the poster child for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this when he trains with Krillin. When Krillin congratulates him on how strong he is, Gohan says Krillin kept surprising him just because of how many different techniques he knew.
</li><li> The 23rd Tournament arc also makes a really big point of this trope: Krillin and Yamcha are absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">curbstomped</a>, but the crowd still cheers wildly for them because their skills were still top-notch.
</li><li> Unbelievably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Mr. Satan</a></em>: in his fight with Cell he attacks with great skill and in such a way that he would have <em>destroyed</em> a normal opponent (indeed, the <em>first</em> attack had a good chance to <em>kill</em> a normal human), but as his opponent was the far stronger Cell he didn't even scratch him. He later proves it again when going against two gunmen-and as the gunmen were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">normal humans</a> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">annihilates them</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco</a></span> has shown his skills again and again, proving that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">his bragging of being a super elite for being a member of the Galactic Patrol is well-founded</a>, with feats that include instantly calculating how much strength he needed to kick a falling giant rocket away from East City without blowing it up and noticing things that escaped <em>Beerus and Champa</em>. In his solo series he also flat-out admits <em>any</em> adult Saiyan would destroy him (he's gotten better by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>, enough to fight a small army of Frieza's soldiers and come out on top, but he's still far from the big guys).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has many examples of how power alone does <em>not</em> win one a fight, and there are plenty of times where an comparatively weaker fighter manages to defeat or hold his own against a stronger one, using unique skills or greater experience:
<ul><li> Although Jaco didn't fight like in the movie, he is able to see Goku and Frieza's battle, something only <em>Gohan</em> is able to do. He was also the first to see that Goku was unharmed from Frieza's energy blast. He also catches Frost <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> cheating when no one else did</span>.
</li><li> When Goku drops his guard, it makes even his powerful body vulnerable to light attacks. Sorbet manages to pierce his heart with a common ray gun after attacking Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>.
</li><li> Vegeta effortlessly overpowers the drained Frieza and knocks him out of his golden form, but still loses when Frieza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">blows up the planet</a> as Frieza can survive in the vacuum of space, while Vegeta can't.
</li><li> Piccolo is this to almost everyone at the Universal tournament. This nearly costs Frost his match since he could have easily put Piccolo away. Piccolo nearly beats him using smart tactics and his own quick thinking. He only loses because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Frost poisons him</span>.
</li><li> Master Roshi was one of the strongest people on the planet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">but he fell badly behind</a> before the end of the original <em>Dragon Ball</em>. He's still, however, a highly skilled and trained martial artist. He manages to take down Frieza's army thanks to his greater experience and he teaches Goku the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Evil Containment Wave</span>. In the Universal Survival Saga, he is chosen to be on U7's team over <em>Goten and Trunks</em> because of his greater experience and moveset, while the kids had proven themselves inefficient fighters.
</li><li> Hit is anything but weak, but he falls behind Goku and Vegeta in terms of pure power. Still, he defeats Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta with ease, despite only using a low amount of power. He can do this because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he can jump 0.1 seconds ahead in time and aim for his vital spots, which Vegeta can't figure out since to him it looks like Hit is moving so fast that he seemingly disappears</span>. When Goku successfully figures out how to counter Hit's fighting style, he fares better against Hit in his base form than Vegeta did even at full power. Hit also completely defies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">Villain Forgot to Level Grind</a>, as he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> levels up his time-leap <em>mid-fight</em> and has several more time techniques in his arsenal in the Universe Survival Arc</span>. When he fights, he usually has to be stuck with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">Worf Had the Flu</a> (he's an assassin fighting in tournaments where he isn't allowed to kill) to keep things fair, and when he fights Goku without any limitations, he quickly <em>kills</em> him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">It didn't stick</a>, of course, but still).
</li><li> A trait among every version of Zamasu, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> barring Black</span>. While he's by no means "weak", his power falls behind Goku, Vegeta, later Future Trunks, the angels, and Gods of Destruction. However, being a Supreme Kai, he posses abilities that are exclusive to his race. He also knows Instant Movement. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His future counterpart adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> to that list, and it effectively means he can tank anything Goku or Vegeta dish out and still come out unscathed</span>.
</li><li> <em>Krillin</em> actually manages to defeat Gohan and stand his ground against Goku in tournament-ruled sparring bouts. Krillin's vast arsenal of techniques <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as the Solar Flare X100 and the remote-controlled Destructo Discs</span> definitely give him a solid chance.
</li><li> Ultra Instinct is this <em>as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUp">Power-Up</a></em>. Ultra Instinct isn't a racial trait (though all Angels seem to know it) or even a technique, <em>per se</em>, but a state of mind; it boosts the user to a state of physical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision">Ludicrous Precision</a> (with maybe a touch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">Hyper-Awareness</a>), making even vast chasms of difference in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Power Level</a> almost a non-issue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jiren's power is leagues above everyone else at the tournament, but Ultra Instinct Goku is able to put him on the ropes because he perfectly dodges all of Jiren's attacks and every one of <em>his</em> blows are disproportionately powerful.</span>

<ul><li> Hyunckel. At the beginning of the series he is portrayed as relatively strong and extremely skilled, but in the last chapters he's actually one of the weakest characters in the main cast, power-wise (though his skill level remains above average). He even develops a special technique allowing him to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use his life as a weapon, in order to compensate his lack of sheer power</span>. It quickly becomes one of the strongest skills in the series.
</li><li> Also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aban</span>, as near the end of the manga he's nowhere as strong as the other cast members, but still useful because of his skills.

With only this skill, and his own stubbornness, Kisiragi shuts down Monta, the best Wide Receiver in-series, and helps his idol, Gaou, take down Hiruma, possibly the smartest Quarterback around.
</li><li> Compared with his junior teammates, who are very large and powerful, quarterback Osamu Kobanzame from the Kyoshin Poseidons is a pushover. He's short, he's not particularly fast or strong, and he's a coward. However, because he don't want to become a burden for his teammates, he strives to perform to the best he can. As result, he became quarterback with great short-pass precision, with no interceptions during the tournament thanks to his cautious playing. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">despite his own misgivings</a>, his junior teammates actually greatly valued him.

Despite not possessing his own inherent magic like the rest of Earth-land inhabitants, he is still considered one of the strongest mages of Fairy Tail.

<ul><li> Amuro's eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Gundam</a> is also much stronger than Char's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority">re-painted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> units, at least at first, but as Char receives more powerful mobile suits, Amuro's piloting skill increases proportionally. Eventually, Char receives a Gelgoog, which is an even match for the Gundam, and finally the Zeong, which ends up reversing their roles by being <em>more powerful</em> than the Gundam.

</li><li> One extra tidbit of information for a volume release showed the pure physical strength rankings of all Hashira by using arm-wrestling as a gauge, Obanai was on the bottom rankings along with Shinobu who had already proclaimed herself to be the physically weakest Pillar; he however protests that physical strength isnt everything, having great confidence in his sword skills and that is validated by him being chosen as the swordsmanship mentor during the Hashira training regime.
</li><li> Tanjiro's father, Tanjuro, looks outright ghastly due his illness in flashbacks, yet his Breathing techniques allowed him to perform physical feats that his body shouldnt be able to handle, like performing his ritual of the Hinokami Kagura in the snow for hours upon hours without getting tired.

There have been numerous times where he was piloting an old, worn down model of AS while fighting against new, far superior AS. And while everyone underestimates him and thinks he'll never win, he ends up taking down the opponents easily by using his skill and strategies. It also helps that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>.

However, he is the most skilled at utilizing the power of his Diary and anticipates moves in combat or finds very specific information from the future.
<ul><li> Said girlfriend is the polar opposite of Yukki, but still manages to fit this trope. She is very strong and skilled, but her Diary is the weakest, only able to predict one persons actions and her own Dead End.

But the Gundams are so strong they can just shrug off the attacks.
</li><li> <em>Gundam</em> fans also ascribe this quality to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket">0080</a></em>'s Bernard "Bernie" Wiseman. By his own admission, he's only ever piloted once and he got shot down very quickly, but in the final episode he uses strategy, tactics, and traps to defeat a Gundam superior to Amuro Ray's<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ydnj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ydnj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ydnj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">albeit with a less skilled test pilot behind the controls</span>.

It's been pointed out that his gunpla is of an old make, one he's had since he was a kid, so his kit could be considered inferior from the outset, but he's introduced as the Italian Champion. As well, it has no Plavsky Particle manipulation gimmicks whatsoever, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but that didn't stop him from fighting the Star Build Strike to a draw <em>after</em> the latter went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> in episode 15, or trouncing them before then</span>.
<ul><li> To note, he's the first person we see to cause Team Nemesis to worry and overclock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aila's Embody System</span> and, unlike <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sei and Reiji with the Star Build Strike's RG Mode</span>, he didn't have anything to help even the odds after that happened.

Both Yuuma and Mr. Ral are convinced that it's going to lose, especially when his teammates' suits, equally built Murasame and Jet Windam, are taken out.

Compared to many of the other teams in GBN, especially the heroes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">the previous series</a>, the team is pathetically weak.

<ul><li> Compared to Ippo, Kenta Kobashi is a weakling, and he's got no badass knockout techniques. In fact, he's never scored a knockout in his career... and yet, Kobashi gives Ippo a run for his money by playing mind-games, making frequent use of clinches, and using a stance that allows him to easily reach with point-getting jabs, while sacrificing his ability to score heavy blows. Definitely <em>not badass</em>, and the audience hates him, but by playing with the rules, Kobashi manages to win most of his matches. He would've beaten Ippo too, if he hadn't tried to finish him with a knockout.
</li><li> Also Ichiro Miyata. His own physical strength is pathetic when compared to other boxers, and he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> in the form of a glass jaw... but he also has <em>huge</em> speed and does what he can to use counters to his benefit.

Having explicitly stated to pilot an outdated 2nd Generation IS Rafale Revive II (the same type that Yamada-sensei uses), albeit customized, she can and has gone toe-to-toe with more modern 3rd generation machines such as Blue Tears and Schwarzer Roegen.

What he lacks in mastery over Hamon, he more than makes up for in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">creativity and guile</a>, defeating his opponents by outwitting them rather than simply overpowering them. In Part 3, he does get a Stand, Hermit Purple, but unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">punch ghosts</a> his companions have, it's just purple vines, and its special powers revolve around information gathering.

The Empress stand targets him because of Hermit Purple's relative weakness, only to find out that its divination powers can be used to make maps to the <em>exact</em> thing (in this case, a barrel of tar) he'd need to defeat her.
<ul><li> Jotaro throughout most of Part 3 is a bizarre fusion of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>. His stand, Star Platinum, has excellent stats, but since Jotaro has only had it for a few days at the start of its adventure, he has absolutely no idea what it can actually <em>do</em>. So unlike the others on his team, he has to make do without use of a special ability throughout the whole trip. He manages with tactical skill, innovative techniques (like focusing all his power into Star's fingertips to allow them to stretch beyond his normal range, or <em>inhaling</em> a stand that took the form of mist), and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">good old fashioned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs">Rapid-Fire Fisticuffs</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> During the final battle, he figures out that his power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stands Still</a>.</span>
</li><li> A Stand's strength is inversely proportional to how far away from its user it can operate, making this trope common among long-range Stand users. Despite lacking a lot of raw power, creative use of their abilities allow long-ranged Stand users to threaten the heroes every bit as effectively, if not more so, than short-ranged fighters who get up close and personal. Often enough, most of a Stand fight is attempting to <em>catch</em> a long-range Stand user while they hide somewhere and use their Stand to hassle the protagonists, who can't effectively fight back until they pin down the user.
</li><li> Oingo's stand Khnum is essentially a weaker version of the earlier Yellow Temperance, as they both allow the user to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">disguise themselves as others</a>, but Yellow Temperance could also defend against attacks and absorb people, while Khnum is <em>just</em> the disguises and doesn't even change Oingo's clothes. However, Oingo is better at <em>utilizing</em> his disguises than Yellow Temperance's user Rubber Soul; while Rubber Soul blew his Kakyoin disguise by acting ridiculously out-of-character, Oingo is able to fool the Crusaders when disguising himself as Jotaro (even replicating a cigarette trick Jotaro liked to do).
</li><li> The D'Arby brothers, Daniel and Terence, work in an organization filled with assassins who have incredibly dangerous and lethal stand powers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and Oingo and Boingo</a>), while their stands have no combat potential <em>at all</em>. What their Stands can do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">steal souls</a> of those who lose to them (in bets or video games, respectively), which does absolutely dip if they can't get people to play against them in the first place. Daniel D'Arby uses a lot of careful preparation and some incredible cheating skills with his knowledge of where Dio's mansion is as bait to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">nearly win all of the Crusaders' souls</a>, only failing because Jotaro psyched him into being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> Chikage Kushinada (and her teacher, Mikumo) adheres to this trope. She's a grade school girl but is shown to be at least on par with the teenage characters because she has enough skill to fight and defeat normal adults. She is a fighter of 100% skill, 0% power, rather than split between the two. What is actually meant by this is that Chikage applies no force of her own during a fight, but uses the enemy's force against them, a tactic used in multiple martial arts. While most fighters are a combination of strength and skill (strength being striking power, skill being throwing power or technique-related ability) Chikage is all skill—she only throws her enemy in such a way as to use their own weight, momentum, etc., against them, rather than create an impact herself. As usual, this stems from the manga taking a martial arts concept to its absolute extreme.

<ul><li> Chrono Harlaown is explicitly mentioned in the first season to be weaker in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">power level</a> compared to Nanoha and Fate, a comparison he scoffs at, stating there's more to magic than that. He then proceeds to prove his point during the penultimate episode of the first season where he pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Precia's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Garden of Time</a> while everyone else needed to charge in as a team, and again <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">in the manga volume set immediately before the second season</a> where he effortlessly defeated an improved Fate in record time when she had to battle him for her Mage Exam.
</li><li> An even better example is Nanoha and Fate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a>, the original Head Trainer Fern Corrado of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Time-Space Administration Bureau</a>. Despite being a lowly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking">AA-ranked</a> mage using standard bureau equipment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">the third season manga</a> revealed that she managed to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">AAA-ranked</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">Bigger Stick</a>-equipped Nanoha and Fate at the same time when they entered the TSAB training school.
</li><li> Yuuno Scrya is quite possibly the weakest — or at least just <em>definitely</em> the least well-armed — combatant in the series. However, his mastery of binding and barrier magics make him the most capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guy</a> ever. He's also demonstrated the ability to force someone to be teleported against their will, which, when you think about it, is probably the single most lethal ability ever shown in the series. The unpleasant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">possibilities</a> for it are endless, but sadly never explored.
</li><li> Shamal is in the same position as Yuuno, only she does have a powerful Device backing her up. She debatably has the most impressive record in the series at standoff combat, nearly paralyzing Nanoha from at least a half-mile away, and in every battle she's had a part in her opponents did not know she was there until attacked. Her skills with barrier, portal, and teleportation magic have endless tactical application that the series never explores, from making people run into instant magical walls at several times the speed of sound to portaling them off somewhere unpleasant. Yuuno would be capable of the same tricks if he had a copy of her Device.
<ul><li> There is the part in the final battle of <em>A's</em> where she locates the defense program's core and, with the help of Yuuno and Arf, teleports it to outer space, where the Arc-En-Ciel can be fired at it without destroying much of Uminari city; scrying, binding and teleportation magic succeeds where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a> can't completely do the job.
</li></ul></li><li> Teana in <em>StrikerS</em> often worries about her own worth as a mage, noting that she has no unique skills and not that much magical power compared to the other members of Section 6. However, she eventually learns how to put her illusion magic to good use in conjunction with her sharpshooting skills, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeats three of the Numbers Cyborgs by use of perfectly timed attacks and some help from Vice</span>. She is apparently Nanoha's best student, as she is the only canon character whom Nanoha taught her signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Starlight Breaker</a> spell (well, Reinforce also used it but she merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copied Nanoha</a>). There is a subtle meaning to this fact: Starlight Breaker's quirk is that it isn't powered by the caster's mana but rather, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckingInLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckingInLines">magical energy dispersed in the environment</a>. In other words, it is the ultimate achievement for a Weak But Skilled mage, allowing her to unleash powers way over her head by skillfully managing the available resources.

After <em>StrikerS</em>, Vivio underwent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion">Redemption Demotion</a> and now lacks both a Relic Core and had her Linker Core damaged from Nanoha's attack. She's notably weaker, lacking her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Saint's Armor</a>, pure magical power and the build for attack or defense. Multiple characters tell her that she's not meant for combat and she gets beaten by other martial arts competitors. Despite this, she develops a fighting style based around skillful dodging and careful attacks, one that lets her fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her Nanoha-mama albeit in a practice match.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is the explicit reason Evangeline McDowell was able to reach the quarterfinals during the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>. Even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">ten-year-old</a> girl can do some damage when she has been practicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu">aikijutsu</a> since before most of the competition's grandparents were born (she only had to break out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">strings</a> against Setsuna).
<ul><li> It is heavily implied that she learned straight from either Morihei Ueshiba or Takeda Sokaku (respectively, the creators of Aikido and Aiki-Jujutsu.)
</li><li> Takahata is unable to cast spells but still manages to be badass within a society of mages with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">Kanka</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">his title</a> is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles">Death Glasses Takahata</a>").
</li><li> The most straightforward example is probably Nodoka, who has very little actual combat experience or magical skill, but still does a number on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who had been erasing people from existence</span>, simply by skillful use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">her artifact</a>. Her artifact is a diary that can read a person's surface thoughts if she knows their name. Not impressive, by itself, but handy. When she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, she teams up with a group of artifact hunters and grabs two things: a ring that, when pointed at a person, reveals their true name, and a doohickey that lets her read books without opening them. The most major villains in the series have been defeated by "What are you planning?", "Where can I find X?", or "How do I escape from this situation?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Pro Hero, "Eraser Head"; is this due to his Quirk, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Erasure</a>". While effective by neutralizing the activation of Quirks of others, it can't affect those that are "mutant" types <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (since they're always activated)</span> or are naturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Quirkless</a>. However, Aizawa makes up for it with his wits and being skilled in combat, capture equipment, and stealth to win a fight. His stats give him an average 3/5 in Power and Cooperation, but a good 4/5 in Speed and Intelligence, and an overwhelming 6/5 in Technique.
</li><li> The "Hero Killer" Stain also falls into this if you judge purely by Quirk. Stain's Quirk, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Bloodcurdle</a>" allows him to paralyze a person by ingesting their blood, with certain blood types being more susceptible than others. Not much compared to powers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Playing with Fire</a>, or being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">An Ice Person</a>. He makes up for it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> knives and honing his raw physical combat ability to high levels to make the most out of his Quirk in combat. His stats give him an excellent 5/5 in Technique and a whopping 6/5 in Speed.
</li><li> When using Full Cowl. Izuku Midoriya's overall power at 5% is only marginally stronger than he was without using it, and he lacks the explosive power of a full powered Smash. However, by increasing his overall power, even at a smaller percent, he is capable of fighting longer, is much faster as a result, and is capable of working in strategies better since he no longer needs to fear breaking his limbs. Furthermore, because he is limiting his power, he can gradually utilize more of it as he improves, allowing him to steadily increase his power, thus improving his abilities naturally. However, as he increases his power with One For All in certain percentages, he reverts back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a> as he has to train to master higher the higher increase in power into his skill.
</li><li> Hitoshi Shinso has excellent control over his Quirk, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">Brainwashing</a>", and is very good at tricking people into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">answering his questions in order to activate it</a>, but as noted by Aizawa during his match against Midoriya, his combat skills are relatively poor and once Midoriya is able to break free of Shinso's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">Mind Manipulation</a>, he overpowers him in minutes. His stats reflect this very well, with his Technique and Intelligence both being 4/5, but Power, Speed and Cooperation being an underwhelming 1/5.
</li><li> Neito Monoma's Quirk allows him to copy the abilities of others' quirks, but he could only use them one at a time and up for 5 minutes. Due to these limitations, he will never be able to rigorously train them like his peers do. But he's listed as having a 5/5 in both Technique and Intelligence, and can use the different quirks creatively.
</li><li> Bean Jeanist is the No. 4 (later promoted to No. 3 after All-Might's retirement) Pro-Hero who's quirk "Fiber Master" gives him control over fibers, denim being the most effective. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">In-spite of its strange nature, it is an incredibly versatile quirk that is good for offense, defense and capture</a>, him being able to overpower and capture an entire league's worth of Nomu's and being able to block a direct attack by All-For-One. All-For-One himself makes an observation that his super-abilities are almost completely reliant on skill and thus rejects it for its low power level, implying that while "Fiber Master" is versatile, it relies on practice and technique for it to be the least bit useful.
</li><li> Mirio Togata, AKA Lemillion, possesses the quirk "Permeation" that makes him intangible at will. This came with a laundry list of drawbacks (complete loss of sense and an ability to breath due to all light and matter slipping through him, his clothes falling off, his body mass weighing him down and causing him to fall through the floor, etc.) that made him fall behind the rest of his peers, but with extensive training in both physical combat and practice with his quirk under Sir Nighteye's supervision, Mirio became one of UA's most promising students. Sir Nighteye chose Lemillion as a potential candidate for One-For-All and Aizawa (famous for his high-standards) claims that he is good enough to become the next No. 1 hero even among active pros.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButPsycho">Himiko Toga</a>'s Quirk allows her to copy the looks of someone whose blood she drunk but not their Quirks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at first</span>, so in combat she relies on a knife and being fast and skilled enough to get the drop even on Heroes in training.
</li><li> To an extent, Hawks also qualifies, having a Quirk which allows him to control the feathers of his wings with his mind. His direct attacks against the Hood do not cause much damage, but he can still demolish ordinary Nomu through pure speed compensating for his average strength. His wings also provide him various forms of utility. Using almost all of his feathers, he was able to telekinetically evacuate everyone in a collapsing building alongside those on the ground, and he can use the feathers to complete multiple tasks at once from a distance, as well as pick up on conversations covertly. In fact, he is one of the few heroes with multiple 6/5 scores in the Ultra Analysis Data Book - both Speed AND Technique.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shikamaru Nara lacks raw power and stamina (by ninja standards) and is initially too lazy to even put in much training, but his sheer intelligence means that he can consistently hold his own against opponents who are not only stronger, but older and more experienced than him. As he was wonderfully described by some troper, "Watching Shikamaru fight is like watching an acrobat work without a net."
</li><li> Amusingly, Sakura Haruno is this in after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> despite possessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and juggernaut-esque healing, as her power and healing abilities are almost solely derived from her excellent chakra control. In terms of her chakra capacity, she's a drop in the ocean next to her far more powerful teammates. Tsunade (her mentor) is much the same.
</li><li> Haku is this in spades. His best attacks come from zipping around at high speed, nailing people with senbon needles in their pressure points, and using his ice mirrors to get faster. Not once does he ever use a truly destructive technique, and yet he would have beaten both Naruto and Sasuke <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">without even trying to kill them</span>, had Naruto not gone berserk when Sasuke went down.
</li><li> Itachi Uchiha is known to have been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">severely weakened by keeping his Sharingan activated permanently</span> throughout the series, yet still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> manages to completely obliterate his perfectly healthy genius brother in their proverbial duel of fate</span>. Even before the diminished capacity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">derived from his illness is brought up</span>, he is said to have less than average power/endurance, which his partner Kisame Hoshikagi hints at by reminding Itachi that he shouldn't use his exceptional ocular powers more than a few times a day, lest he be completely drained. What Itachi lacks in quantitative power, he more than makes up for in qualitative.
</li><li> For that matter, Neji Hyuga is one of the most dangerous of the Konoha 12 and the first to make Jonin, despite having relatively low physical strength. His mastery of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint">Gentle Fist</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Byakugan</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Heavenly Spin</a> render him capable of crippling opponents far physically stronger than him while blocking, dodging, or redirecting most attacks. For instance, he was able to fight on equal terms with Naruto during the Chunin exams and was favored to win that fight, even when Naruto drew power from the Nine Tailed Fox, allowing Naruto to completely outclass him in terms of raw power, stamina, and quantity of attacks (thanks to Naruto's Shadow Clones).
</li><li> Rock Lee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">plays with</a> this trope. He's immensely strong, fast, and durable, and has mastered the Eight Celestial Gates, which makes him exponentially more powerful. However, he also has <em>only</em> his physical skills because he can't use chakra other than for the gates. His sensei Might Guy is much the same way, though he <em>can</em> use conventional chakra techniques (but just chooses not to).
</li><li> The Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, was this as well, at least compared to his peers. His most destructive technique shown was the A-Rank Rasengan... which at full power, can destroy <em>maybe</em> a twenty-foot area. Compared even to most equivalent elemental jutsu, that's pretty underwhelming (for comparison's sake, the A-Rank Giant Waterfall Jutsu can splinter and flood an entire forest in the hands of a Jounin-level user). And yet his speed, brutally efficient combat style, and mastery of sealing techniques (not to mention his teleportation powers) made him one of the deadliest shinobi in all of history.
</li><li> Tobi, at least in comparison with other members of Akatsuki. His space-time abilities make him one of the most powerful tactical fighters of the series, but he almost never uses large scale ninjutsu, whereas the rest of Akatsuki relies on several highly destructive techniques. It's because of this deficiency in raw power that Itachi was convinced that "Madara" was a shadow of his former self; at the time, Tobi was masquerading as the real Madara Uchiha, who was tied with the First Hokage (aka the second "God of Shinobi") in strength. It should be noted that his ability to control several tailed beasts with his eyes makes up for his lack of personal firepower. And this is not to mention when he became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Jinchuuriki of the Ten-Tails</a>...
</li><li> Konan is a subversion. At first glance, her paper ninjutsu seems fairly underwhelming, as she mainly uses it to travel around, capture or bog down opponents, and avoid taking hits via flight or splitting into sheets of paper. It's effective enough to get the better of multiple Konoha shinobi, and even Jiraya for a while, but ultimately doesn't amount to much. That is, until she faces the above-mentioned Tobi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and breaks out the explosives. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">Six-hundred</a> <em>billion</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">explosive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowDownTheBomblet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowDownTheBomblet">tags</a>, in fact. Tobi only escapes by using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> Izanagi and sacrificing his left eye in the process</span>.
</li><li> Kakashi Hatake is this as well. Though he lacks in stamina compared to other top-level ninja, he's considered the equal of the unbelievably powerful Might Guy by virtue of having learned literal hundreds of jutsu and being a master tactician who rarely fights his enemies head-on until he's ready to destroy them. Despite still being <em>way</em> more powerful than the average Jounin, he's also <em>way</em> outclassed in strength by most of the Kage-level fighters he's compared to as an equal. It's perhaps no surprise that Kakashi was a student of the aforementioned Fourth Hokage.
<ul><li> One of the most interesting things about Kakashi's case is that his strength is so obviously displayed. He's known internationally as "The Man Who Copied a Thousand Jutsu", but that in and of itself both hides and reveals his true strength: not that he can copy your techniques with his Sharingan, but that he has thousands of them and thus likely has a counter to <em>everything you can do</em>. And yet he consistently makes people fall for variations on the same tricks, time after time. He basically subverts his own combat style at will just to screw with his enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> Kabuto Yakushi during Part 1, in a similar vein to Sakura above. Sure, he can't destroy much himself, but he can sever muscles and tendons and even damage internal organs with his Chakra Scalpels (which are normally impossible to use in combat because they require such intense focus; they're a technique intended for surgery). And he can also heal himself from any injury he takes, up to and including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having his stomach puréed by Naruto's Rasengan</span>, by using that same unreal chakra control to <em>heal the individual cells of his body</em>. It has limits, though, as he lacks the chakra capacity to completely recover from large enough hits; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto's attack still takes him out despite not killing him like it should have</span>. He became Strong AND Skilled during Part 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thanks to assimilating his old master Orochimaru's remains and mastering the techniques of him and several of his strongest minions while losing none of the brilliance he had already, which allows him to become one of the few beings capable of defeating Itachi Uchiha, only losing thanks to Sasuke's interference</span>.
</li><li> Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Third Hokage, had become this by the end of his life. While undeniably still strong enough to hold the title of Hokage, Sarutobi's incredible raw power had degraded over time, as age sapped his stamina and chakra capacity. In his prime, Sarutobi was capable of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">Ninjutsu of all</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">five elements simultaneously</a> basically at will, but by the time he's in his 70's, he can really only use one or two at a time, and he can't spam them with impunity either. Instead, he focused on his bojutsu, fuuinjutsu, and combination attacks, as well as a greater reliance on strategy and working with his Summons than in his youth. His age doesn't stop him from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">going toe-to-toe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Orochimaru</a> and two (imperfectly) reanimated Hokage</span> during Operation Konoha Crush and holding him to, at best, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though Sarutobi admits that if he'd been at his full strength, he could have taken Orochimaru out via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">his Shiki Fuuin</a></span>.

Usopp, an amateur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a>, has also built various weapons for himself and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">Weather-Control Machine</a> for Nami with the specific intent of using their brains over their brawn to win battles. And he has proved that he's no pushover; when he goes all-out, he's capable of giving <em>Luffy</em> a run for his money while his entire body is injured and bandaged up. And as for Nami...well, <em>the weather</em> is her weapon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Robin</a> would also qualify. While her physical strength is minuscule compared to the majority of foes that come her way, her extensive experience as an assassin as well as having two decades to work out the uses of her powers ensure that she's still very much a serious threat to most people. Furthermore, the nature of her powers allow her to apply what strength she has almost infinitely, limited only by the surface area of what she is grabbing. She has used this to twist a giant's arm behind its back with a giant arm made of other arms. Through smart use of her powers, she's one of the most dangerous Straw Hats and often lumped in with the far physically stronger 'monstrous trio.'
</li><li> For a villainous example, Foxy. He's not exactly "weak" per se, but he's a total joke compared to Luffy when it comes to raw power. He makes up for it with surprisingly clever use of his Devil Fruit power, as well as cheap tactics and low blows.
</li><li> Another villainous example is Ain from the twelfth movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmZ">One Piece Film: Z</a></em>. She may be far from weak, but her physical strength still pales in comparison to her captain and several of her foes. To make up for it, she is very fast and uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">her Devil Fruit powers</a> in creative ways to gain or regain the upper hand in fights.
</li><li> Amongst the Seven Warlords of the Sea, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Gekko Moriah</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">least physically fit</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">most rusty from slacking off his training</a> due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>, but his complete and utter mastery of his Devil Fruit's powers and having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">shit-ton of zombies of varying strength</a> serving with absolute loyalty allows him to take on the entire Straw Hat crew at once and still have a decent chance of winning. Unfortunately for him, the World Government saw his poor performance as too much of a hassle to justify keeping around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">and attempted to have him killed</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though he escaped with his life and went into hiding</span>.
</li><li> Rebecca from the Dressrosa arc may very well be the physically weakest fighter in the Corrida tournament, but she still makes it to the finals because she is the master of a fighting style that lets her use her opponents' strength against them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut">knock them out of the ring</a>, and because she is the only one whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">Haki</a> is good enough to anticipate Cavendish's/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hakuba's</span> attack and dodge it. That said, she is very fast, so she's not entirely without physical skills.
</li><li> This is usually a trait of the more successful Paramecia-type Devil Fruit users. While they lack the straightforward abilities of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">Logia</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Zoan</a> fruits, they often make up for it with the most outside-the-box thinking and diversity in the application of a single fruit's powers. While a few Paramecia fruits provide massive destructive power (the category is simply a catch-all for anything that's not Logia or Zoan), most are far from impressive. Even the main character Luffy became far <em>weaker</em> as a child when he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit and became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a>; it took years of training before he could even regain the ability to throw a punch. While he's become monstrously strong since then, he's had to come up with truly bizarre ways of utilizing his Devil Fruit power to do so (thus he personally doesn't fit this trope, but his Devil Fruit power pretty much does).
<ul><li> There are also some clear example of Zoans like this, because the inherent combat potential varies greatly depending on which specific animal the Zoan can transform into. Being able to become a leopard or a king cobra or a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">T. rex</a></em> provides very obvious strength, but transforming into a giraffe? Not so much. But after eating that Devil Fruit, Kaku is able to use both his assassin training and his innate creativity to come up with an amazing variety of deadly attacks using his giraffe transformation, and does so <em>on the fly</em> in the middle of battle.

</li><li> Zombieman doesn't have freakish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">strength</a>, or much offensive capacity at all, but his main skill is being unable to die, <em>ever</em>; and since he can practically regenerate from everything, with a skill like that you don't need to be terribly strong when you can simply outlast the strength of your enemy.
</li><li> For extremely relative values of "weak", but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Garō</a> is noted as posing a particular threat because, while previous monsters relied on brute strength to overwhelm heroes, Garō fights with actual martial arts and specializes in redirecting his opponents' attacks instead of just countering them. Basically, his fighting style is geared specifically towards defeating heroes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Once he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>, he becomes this especially in comparison to Saitama, as while he's still much weaker (something he himself admits), he completely surpasses him in terms of martial arts and even manages to force him to fight "Semi-Seriously".</span>

However, she rarely engages in direct combat as her victories are contributed to her skilled use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitIndex">gambits</a>.
</li><li> Yellow counts too, when she's not using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">level-booster powers</a>. By base level alone, she is by far the weakest of the Dex Holders. She can think up of a few sound strategies during battle to make up for her lack of strength (since overusing her powers rapidly exhausts her), but the flaws of this trope are pointed out to her when she works out a complicated scheme to counter Lance's offense but is unable to actually break through his defense due to simply not having enough power.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>:
<ul><li> Syuusuke Fuji. He eschews physical fitness and outright strength in favor of counter techniques that require outrageous (impossible) amounts of skill to perform. He later gains some strength in a filler training camp in the anime, but this never happens in the manga. Either way, it stops being addressed as the series delves into further ludicrousness.
</li><li> Also Eiji Kikumaru, who has a flashy and fun style of playing yet is plagued by low stamina. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unlike Fuji, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> that makes him go from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> happens in both the anime and manga.</span>

</li><li> This trope is pretty commonplace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>. Ranma defeated Prince Herb, who far outclassed him in every way possible, by using a technique to gather up all of the energy Herb was giving off and turning it against him.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> with Happosai: at first he seems just a frail old man who can easily toss far stronger opponents through walls or over the horizon by redirecting their momentum with a pipe, but at times he shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">he's just as powerful</a>, and rarely shows his real power because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">it's funnier that way</a>.

Kenshin is a short, skinny and relatively weak man, so much so that he eventually has to give up swordmanship because his kenjutsu style is meant to be used by stronger men and overusing it damaged his muscles. Despite this handicap, he is able to take down the most powerful warriors in the series (aside from his own master) because he's just <em>that damn skilled</em>.

He can defeat his overpowered son and friends with his technique alone, but then again, Yoh and friends don't seem to understand that in the anime.
<ul><li> There's also the fight against Lee Bai Long. To stop him after he goes berserk once Jun's spell tag is destroyed, Anna summons the ghost of Bai Long's deceased master, who possesses Yoh in order to put the raging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">zombie</a> down.

Askeladd fights like this as well, all the time, but with him there's a slight subversion. Despite the tactics he employs physically he's still one of the strongest characters in the series.

Series protagonist Osamu also has the problem. And being a rookie at the start of the series, he has to work on that "skilled" part, too.
<ul><li> Border as a whole effectively ends up as this in the Invasion arc. The vast majority of Border members can't match the raw power and advanced triggers of the Aftokratorian invasion team, and have to beat them though tactics, skill, numbers, and outright trickery.

But in a universe where Card Games are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, Yugi reigns supreme.

<ul><li> The Pharaoh is a prime example of this trope regarding the games. In Capsule Monster Chess, he defeated Mokuba's strong monsters with a single weakling. And in the card game Duel Monsters, he's so good that he defeated Obelisk the Tormentor with his three Magnet Warriors. And in the 10th Anniversary movie, his deck is actually very old and weak in comparison to his two partners Judai and Yusei and the opponent Paradox, yet he manages to destroy the Malefic Paradox Dragon (4000 ATK) with his freaking Dark Magician, who doesn't have even an effect.
</li><li> Haga/Weevil likes to affect this image, as he plays a deck of mostly weak Insects supplanted with powerful cards and abilities, and tends to make more tactical plays than other Duelist Kingdom players. However, this is subverted later on, as it turns out he's actually in many ways just as reckless as his fellows; whenever he gets his hands on something powerful, he blunders right into a trap. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught">He also cheats, which he considers skill.</a>

GX</a></em>, Jun Manjoume conquers the North Academy with a mix of random weak cards. Later, his brothers challenged him to a duel where Manjoume must only use monsters with maximum 500 ATK. He wins anyway (in fact, he took the challenge further by using 0-ATK cards). Also, Manjoume's final deck has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Ojama trio</a> as his core cards besides his Armed Dragons.

However, since his deck is built for Synchro Summoning and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">prepared for almost every situation</a>, he never loses on-screen. This goes away later on as he displays more and more Synchros, though.
<ul><li> Team Taiyou is probably the biggest example in the franchise. "Budget" doesn't begin to describe their decks, which are mostly made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a>, random Speed Spells, and Traps that would have been subpar in Duelist Kingdom. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">so lacking on offense</a> that their main source of damage is a Field Spell exclusive to the tournament they played in. Even their D-Wheel is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>. In spite of all this, they managed to reach the WRGP quarterfinals, give Team 5Ds an incredibly close match, and bring out a card so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> that it was thought to be unsummonable, all by playing to their strengths and eking out a near-unbreakable stall.

However, Genkai pointed out strength and skill are equally important and mocked him for not building up his strength before beating the shit out of him.
</li><li> Sniper more or less fits the trope. Physically, he's a normal human who could easily be knocked out from a mere tap by any of the main characters, yet he's dangerous enough of a psychic and marksman to give <em>Genkai</em> the chills. And sure enough, Yusuke stood no real chance against him during their "fight." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately for Yusuke, Hiei was lurking about.</span>
</li><li> Kuwabara also fits this trope to an extent. He's the weakest of the main cast by a fair margin, and his overall skill isn't as great as the others. Despite this, he is incredibly gifted in energy manipulation, winning or coming close in a great many of his fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">through his many impromptu variations of his Spirit Sword</a>, even managing to defeat somebody roughly two spirit classes above him.

He admits that Yusuke is every bit his physical superior in almost every way, but he has him completely outclassed when it comes to skill in real combat, and though they both use the same tactics of analyzing their opponents fighting style he's done it for far longer and can predict his every move, and finally concludes with the fact he's far more skilled and powerful with his spirit energy.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> have a couple of these among their ranks:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> is stronger and more agile than a normal human, but is significantly weaker than many of his fellow Avengers. Despite this, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> tactical genius and one of the few heroic examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> archetype, making him very effective. He's managed to get the drop on many more powerful opponents, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto">Mephisto</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">himself</a>.
</li><li> Then you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackKnightMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackKnightMarvelComics">Black Knight</a> (Dane Whitman). Compared not just to the team powerhouses but even to guys like Black Panther and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> he seems underpowered, being a completely normal human with a sword and a grab-bag assortment of gadgets and enchanted weapons to fight bad guys with. He is, however, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> who has bested the likes of Captain America and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> with his blade, a skilled martial artist, and a gifted scientist who started out as a physicist and has since acquired a wide range of scientific disciplines. He is also fairly familiar with magic, giving him a leg up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMagic">most of Marvel's scientific community</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>. He's a guy with a funny suit and a bunch of neat toys who runs around with people who can bench-press planets. And, whenever there's a conflict, <em>he wins</em>, because he's the most skilled. It helps he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetrayalInsurance">keeps Kryptonite on his body at all times in the off chance Superman is a danger</a>. Let alone his other plans...
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. He might be a normal, rather fragile human, but he can concoct poisons and create gadgets that regularly overcome metas on a routine basis. Add in the fact that he would sell his soul for a box of cigars and massacre a kindergarten class on a whim, and you've got a guy whom almost every other DC Supervillain fears.
</li><li> Tim Drake, the third Robin, shows off how much he's learned by employing the same tactics. In the last issue of his solo series, he's challenged to a duel to the death by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LadyShiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LadyShiva">Lady Shiva</a>, <em>the</em> deadliest assassin in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, who trained him in the first place. After what appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">Single-Stroke Battle</a>, Tim is stumbling, with three broken ribs, while Shiva is standing confidently... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until she falls to the ground, paralyzed. Tim spiked some hotel chocolates with a paralytic poison, activated by a heightened heart rate, <em>before she even wrote the note challenging him</em>.</span> Standing over her, Tim then explains this trope: If he can't match someone with skill or strength, he'll beat them with his smarts.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> only has one superpower, her ultrasonic scream. Other than that, she's about as powerful as any human. However, she is also a skilled fighter and is able to take on highly powered individuals. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, she even bested Superboy in a sparring match despite him having super strength.
</li><li> On paper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> isn't all that impressive. He's listed as the height of human potential, but a good chunk of his enemies are <em>way</em> beyond that. Unfortunately for most villains, he's more than skilled enough to make him one of the top A-list heroes in Marvel. On at least one occasion, he's actually beaten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a>. He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">made a point of reading up on just about every major villain and threat the Avengers and U.S. government have gathered data on</a>, so he often starts fights with villains knowing what to look out for and what their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weaknesses</a> are.
<ul><li> In one instance Captain America lost the strength and agility that was given to him by the Super Solider serum, turning him back into "that skinny kid from Brooklyn". While being intimidated by some newly super-powered thugs, Cap tells them that while the serum gave him physical strength, his skills are the result of years of training and discipline. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">He then demonstrates.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> has a powerset consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a> that compensates for his blindness by giving him a special "radar sense" instead. Other than that, he relies on his athleticism and combat training to survive. That said, it's often all Daredevil needs, as he's very creative in figuring out ways to use his powers to defeat enemies that otherwise outclass him in sheer power. He's even defeated villains like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Mr.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Hyde</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">the Absorbing Man</a>, guys who regularly give <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> fits, this way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> (yes, really), when up against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">caliber of threat that will get a Sorcerer Supreme involved</a>, is almost always overpowered and outclassed. He still wins through a combination of luck, knowledge, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">clever use of what he has</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered">Empowered</a> has shown signs of this. While her supersuit really is pretty powerful, it is easily damaged and rendered useless, making her an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. However, unlike 99% of the other superheroes in her universe, she actually thinks, and this has allowed her to beat villains that others were not able to. She also notes that as cool as throwing a car looks, you'll do much more damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">by just driving it into them.</a>
</li><li> This is the schtick of Reed Richards a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic">Mister Fantastic</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>. He's physically the weakest member of the team, but his mind makes him the most dangerous by a long shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grendel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Grendel">Grendel</a></em> especially the Hunter Rose and Christine Spar versions. Hunter Rose was a slight man and not particularly tall, but he was a teenage fencing champion. And of course, he was intellectually brilliant. Christine Spar was a tall, thin woman who, however was said to practice kendo. She was good in tracking and spying but physically, she couldn't handle more than petty thugs or not so bright animal cops like Dominic Riley. Also, because she was the least malevolent Grendel, her body count was quite small compared to other Grendels as she didn't really seek to kill anyone except her son's kidnappers. She didn't even think to finish off thugs that she maimed, such as Tujiro stooge Niccolo. Of the handful of people she killed, two were killed by a carbomb, not direct physical combat. The only heavyweights that Christine fought were Tujiro and Argent. However, Tujiro escaped and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she died fighting Argent</span>.
</li><li> Cassie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HackSlash">Hack/Slash</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> always fighting against undead monsters many times stronger than her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">John Constantine</a> is, by his own admission, terrible at fighting. He will more often than not lose out in a straight-up fist fight and doesn't really use any magic outside of rituals, and then only when absolutely necessary. Regardless, anyone who decides to piss him off better watch their backs, because chances are that he will be arranging some spectacularly terrible fate for them somewhere down the line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>: Hideko Takata was a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeBusters">Hulkbusters</a> in the late 1980s. She's a normal, overweight, middle-aged woman, who managed to <em>throw the Hulk to the ground,</em> by expert use of judo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is Karate Kid's entire schtick: although he technically doesn't possess any super-powers, he can still hold his own against Superman thanks to his knowledge of every martial art in existence.
</li><li> Triplicate Girl also counts. While she does have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDuplication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDuplication">superpower</a>, she's still only as tough as the average human. However, her skill in Tri-Jutsu, a martial art that works in the twelve points of attack and unique method of dodging her power grants her, along with her talents in infiltration and information gathering, make her a valuable member of the Legion
</li></ul></li><li> Jesse Custer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em> is this compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Cassidy</a>, and has kicked his ass. As Jesse puts it, "Fella taught me to fight was the same piece of shit shot my daddy dead in fronta my eyes. That'll tend to focus your concentration".
<ul><li> One of Jesse and Cassidy's fights hilariously subverts this. Cassidy throws a punch in a rage, which Jesse blocks; Cassidy is cowed and leaves. Jesse immediately asks Tulip and Amy to drive him to the hospital, as the punch broke every bone in his hand.
</li><li> Tulip also fits this trope, being a talented gunfighter who routinely goes up against both normal humans several times her size/strength and supernatural creatures. In particular is the time she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots Cassidy out of a window and into the sunlight</span>. Bonus points for doing it with a hangover.
</li></ul></li><li> Amy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em>. She never gains the raw power of Sonic or Knuckles, but her smarts and ranged combat abilities allow her to be almost as effective under the right conditions.
</li><li> Believe it or not, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> in relation to the rest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>. Sure his powers are pretty impressive to a normal person, but he's a lightweight compared to the some of the guys he normally hangs out with. However, by using his brains, all his powers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">absolute refusal to give up</a> he can, and often does, take down even literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a>.
<ul><li> Doesn't hurt that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rages</a> are quite possibly the most legitimate in Marvel, next to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">the Hulk</a> himself.
</li><li> Most of his rogues' gallery is stronger than him, and many of them can break his webbing, so Spider-Man has to outthink all of his opponents. One of his favorite tricks is to hit an enemy with a strand of web, even though said villain is physically stronger and heavier so Spider-Man cannot throw him. When the enemy tries to yank Spider-Man towards them, he uses the momentum to deliver a nasty kick or punch.
</li><li> It also doesn't hurt his physical abilities are some of the most well balanced around. There are stronger, but they usually have nowhere near his speed and agility and those who are more agile and faster are nowhere near as strong.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, he has been written as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a> in some story arcs. During the Big Time arc he was temporarily stripped of his Spider Sense, and his fighting ability took a hit as a result, as he tended to rely on the early warning of his Spider Sense to anticipate his opponent's attacks. To compensate for the loss of his Spider Sense, he accepted an offer to learn martial arts from Shang Chi, one of the top martial artists in the Marvel Universe. Once Shang Chi taught him the basics, they perfected a unique fighting style called The Way of the Spider, which exploited Spider-Man's physical strength, speed and agility to maximum effect.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SquirrelGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SquirrelGirl">Squirrel Girl</a>, who has the powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">talking to squirrels while having squirrel agility</a>, takes down Marvel powerhouses, including the Cosmic Powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">exploiting their one weakness</a>, being just that good, or having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> is also a factor. This trope probably applies to the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatLakesAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatLakesAvengers">Great Lakes Avengers</a> team. They get no respect from the other superheroes, and their powers are...weird. Yet they still save the day now and then.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars">Warlord of Mars</a></em> comics, one arc has Dejah Thoris transported to the future where Mars is invaded by Earthlings. The Red Men are shown able to overpower the humans physically, despite humans being as strong as the mighty Green Men. However, the Red Men are also expert swordsmen and the humans come from a time period when hand to hand combat is rarely used (additionally humans don't have the great height and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">4 arms</a>, so they're not as big a melee threat to the Red Men).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteSand">White Sand</a></em>: Kenton is ridiculously weak compared to his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Sand Masters</a>, but thanks to that he's learnt to control the little he has with far greater precision. Even though he can only control a single "ribbon" of sand at a time, he passes a test designed to challenge and flaunt the abilities of people who can control two dozen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the titular heroine always has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, and is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a>, she's sometimes this given that she often faces off with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a>. Notable, against her two main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">archenemies</a>, Ares and Circe, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">god of war</a> and a powerful immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorceress</a> respectively, her strength means little, so she had to rely on her wits, her Amazonian training and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">upstoppable determination</a> to defeat them.
</li><li> Hippolyta, Diana's mother was able to best Heracles through nothing but pure fighting skill and superior tactics. Really, any Amazon that isn't Diana, Donna or Cassie would qualify.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis">Artemis</a>, Diana's rival, isn't as strong as Diana but is still a skilled fighter.

<ul><li> Originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> was one of these, being a minor telepathic talent compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX">Professor X</a> who nevertheless matched him in skill. As time went on and Frost graduated from her villainous White Queen persona, she began to acquire power along with her skill. Now, thanks to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> she's arguably the top telepath in the X-Men universe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> has two lieutenants in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMenAcolytes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMenAcolytes">Acolytes</a>. One is Exodus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> winner writ large, and the other is Fabian Cortez, a guy with the mutant power of... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">Super Empowering</a>. One would think on the face of it that Exodus would easily be the more capable leader, until they studied Cortez a bit more closely. Aside from being better educated (due to being a child of royalty), Cortez is also a gifted strategist (believably claims to have studied each and every X-Man), expert martial artist (so much so that he defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke">Psylocke</a> the first time they fought) and gifted politician (so much so that Magneto brought him on to be a part of his cabinet on Genosha <em>after</em> Cortez had betrayed and tried to kill him).

The series has loads characters who are too old (Barristan Selmy, Syrio Forell) or too thin (Loras Tyrell) to be considered "strong" but are extremely capable fighters, usually because they are both naturally skilled, very well trained, and unusually brave. This is realistic since there is no use being a bag of muscle if you are clumsy, untrained or just too weak-minded to hold yourself on a battlefield or in another life-or-death situation. In other words, being strong and resilient may make you a good soldier (since much of soldiering is enduring months of underfeeding, sleeping in camps, forced marches, exhausting work and generally horrible life conditions) but it does not automatically make you a good fighter. (The reverse is true: many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> is a capable fighter but could never endure the life conditions of the rank and file.)

This is a world where several civilizations have been wiped out because their own wizards cast mighty spells without properly understanding what the effects would be. Her spells do what she wants, and she often knows exactly how a spell will backfire when the caster doesn't even know there will be side effects. She'd lose to almost anyone in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a>, but as an adviser she's invaluable.

Her short and thin frame leaves her at a disadvantage in a fight when all of the men and most of the other women are larger and stronger, and haven't starved a day in their lives. Her sole combat ability relies on her skill with a bow, which the Gamemakers play up by only putting one bow and twelve arrows into the Arena. Only once she's gotten that bow does she even <em>think</em> about mounting an offensive against the Careers, but it is her skill with wilderness survival, tendency to ration and plan ahead, and speed and agility that allow her to hold out long enough in the meantime. It also seems she's pulled a Batman and tried to recall what worked in previous Hunger Games to help decide her course of action. If a natural charisma also counts as a skill, it certainly helps her get much-needed assistance.

In fact, the children of Athena, and also the children of other, lower deities, are among the weaker demigods. When fighting monsters or other opponents, Annabeth almost always relies on her wisdom and tactical skills. However, even weak demigods are still much stronger than humans.

Fighters have slightly fewer hitpoints, move slower, and can't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Rage</a>, but they can equip heavy armour and tower shields as standard, they have more combat feats, and they are at least literate - Barbarians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead">Never Learned to Read</a>.
</li><li> Lore Bards in 5th Edition are quite literally weak, but skilled. They are rather poor direct combatants due to their D8 hit die and lack of access to heavy weapons and armour, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">they have by far the most skill proficiencies of any available class</a>, the chance to get expertise (double proficiency) in four of them at max level and the aptly-named "Jack of All Trades" feature lets them add half their proficiency bonus to any skill they aren't already proficient in - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">including Initiative</a>. They can also borrow spells and cantrips from <em>other classes' spell lists</em>.
</li><li> In 5e, monks are an excellent choice for this, their Martial Arts ability allowing them to attach their dexterity bonus to melee attack and damage rolls. Feel free to put Strength as your dump stat while remaining on the frontline. (Quick tip: Go for a high dexterity, take a single level of monk and multiclass into something that uses heavier weapons)

Probably the only game where people get into arguments over who has the <em>weakest</em> of something.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, Weak But Skilled tends to be an advantage. A creature having high power or toughness stats and no other special traits or abilities is utterly unremarkable (after all, the most common creature-removal spells simply kill or otherwise remove creatures without looking twice at their size). However, some of the most valuable creatures to have are small ones (in terms of power and toughness) with useful abilities like <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204035712/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=198383">the ability to retrieve any Equipment from your deck, and put any Equipment in your hand into play for a low, fixed cost<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191025055245/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=185749">the ability to give you extra mana just for putting more lands onto the battlefield, especially in formats where the ability to do so more often is commonplace<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

However, Magick also allows Mages a degree of control over any facet of reality: it's possible for a well-prepared Mage to develop completely coincidental counter-measures that can neutralize any other Supernatural's abilities.
<ul><li> To highlight this, one of the truly unique things a mage can do that no other splat can in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a> is to rewind time, allowing them effectively a few extra moments and some foreknowledge in combat. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a>, this is replaced by the ability to selectively rewrite his past, declaring that he spent the last ten years studying lock-picking and escape-driving instead of riflery and science, allowing him to retroactively have prepared mundane defenses and learned appropriate skills.
</li><li> The unofficial national sport of Mage players is negation of other supernaturals, seeing how few ranks in a magical discipline one needs to render a massively stronger opponent mortal, such as using a low-level mental power to prevent a werewolf's rage or remove the friction from the ground beneath a speed-based vampire.
</li><li> Hunters (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning">both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">kinds</a>) even more so.

Through cunning, fighting dirty and planning, however, Hunters can and many times do put down the things that go bump in the night.
</li></ul></li><li> The second edition of the Champions/Hero System rulebook explicitly pointed out that in the game system as it existed at that time, DEX was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>, because DEX was used in calculating several other stats.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em>, characters take an old age roll at the end of each four-year career term starting with the one ending at age 34 when generating the character's backstory. Failing this roll (which gets increasingly likely as the character gets older and the penalties become increasingly severe) will drain physical attributes, but staying in a career for longer will, among other things, increase the character's skills.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em> the dragon Everblight is the weakest of his kind, but has unmatched skill. While his mighty father relies heavily upon undead because his mere presence sickens and kills the living, Everblight's armies are almost all creatures that he has created or corrupted through his own blight, and is capable of subtle changes such as increasing the birth and maturation rates of his minions. He's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">made himself weaker</a> by splitting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive">athanc</a> into pieces and giving the shards to his commanders, forgoing having a body in favor of improved coordination between his forces.

This usually results in an immediate damage increase out of the Rogue, as players usually build their Rogues with high Dexterity.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">sequel</a>, Rogues have a few different skills they can take that do things like replace Dexterity with Strength for calculating damage, gain them a 1% bonus to critical hit damage per point of Cunning (high level rogues will easily have 30+ points of Cunning, before any armor bonuses), and increase the 'chance' of scoring a critical hit by 1% per each point of Cunning. Combine this with the fact that your characters no longer control like drunken yaks like in the first game, and a Rogue ability that moves them directly to the target's rear, thereby making flanking 'much' easier, a Rogue with 14 strength will really put the Cannon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.

Enemies level scale based purely on your level, but your actual strength in combat involves many factors besides just level (health gain per level, attributes, equipment, and skills). As such, leveling up with too many non-combat skills is likely to result in an insignificant bonus to your abilities, but all enemies still increase in strength. One way to combat the issue is to combine this trope with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage">Low-Level Advantage</a> by increasing <em>skills</em> but <em>never sleeping</em> (which is required to actually level up). Though this severely limits your ability to make use of NPC trainers, as you can only use them five times per level, your skills will still increase naturally through use and by finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">skill books</a>. This ultimately leads to the world being saved from a horde of feeble monsters by a strangely competent insomniac.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a>:</em> Tomb-Colonists. Their bodies are ravaged by injuries so horrible they stuck even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">dying and getting back up</a>, and continued to degrade after that from both age and wear. But since the kind of person that gets so horribly damaged usually leads a dangerous life to begin with, and because the Tomb-Colonies are <em>horribly dull</em>, they usually pass their days challenging each other to deadly duels (or at least, deadly for others that aren't as ragged as them). Thus, their mangled bodies can't put out much strength, but they have more experience than anyone else and can easily kill much livelier and stronger fighters in seconds. Fittingly, they're one of the three factions who can teach you how to be Dangerous (with the heavily-armed Revolutionaries and the muscular, brawl-happy Dockers being the other two).
</li><li> In the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games, it's possible to take an at-creation trait called Skilled, that makes your character into one of these. You gain perks (miscellaneous, but potent benefits) less often but get a bonus to all your skills (medicine, gun skills, etc). It's generally considered inferior to its counterpart trait since skills are easy to raise and specialize in, but perks come only with level gains.
<ul><li> It makes a comeback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> where it instead means that you get 10% less experience points, but instead gain 5 experience points in every skill. Here it becomes a trait to cherish, as while it takes more time level up, a low level character with Skilled can be more effective than a high level character.
</li><li> <em>New Vegas</em> actually has another example, in unarmed combat. Since (excepting the ballistic fist) most unarmed weapons only require 2 strength to be used properly, a character can have only 2 strength (pitifully low) but still have vast unarmed combat abilities, capable of punching people across rooms. The learnable combat moves take this up to eleven, allowing enemies to be knocked down, disarmed, and countered without "strength" factoring into it at all. Possibly averted in that unarmed combat is based off of "endurance", a measure of how resistant you are to attacks, which could be thought of as "strong"
<ul><li> If Raul Tejada is inspired to be the Vaquero that he once was, he states that while he's an old man who's eyesight and body aren't what they used to be, his brains can make up for that and he's still quick with a gun. His Old Vaquero perk lets him fire revolvers and lever-action rifles 33% faster.

Swordmasters have high speed and skill with a relatively low strength cap, but also gain a boost anywhere from 15% to 30%, depending on game, to their critical chance. Assassins tend to have the lowest strength cap in any given game they're in for final class promotions, but also have the highest skill cap, and are the only class with a one hit kill move that deals death even if they'd normally not even do damage with a normal attack.
<ul><li> One specific character example is Luthier from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a>, <em>Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</em>. He has a fairly low magic growth but the highest skill growth in the game, and he even gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a> foil in his little sister Delthea.

Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist who had barely earned the distinction of his Ph.D. at the time of the Black Mesa Incident. I have good reason to believe that in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the games where he is playable, Proto Man is an example of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Due to a defect in his power system, he is in constant pain, and</span> ingame tends to take fewer hits because of it. Avoiding hits and fighting smart is his only option to take on enemies.
</li><li> Mega Man, himself, at least to begin within his games. His Mega Buster is vastly inferior in terms of power to his opponents. Only by the end of the game, when he's a walking arsenal of doom, does he go to the other side...and then <em>still</em> requires skill, because he's still just a small robot facing huge massive weapons of destruction.
</li><li> His buster's ability to adapt weapons is also an interesting case of this. He's instantly able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PossessionImpliesMastery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PossessionImpliesMastery">use new weapons</a>, but because he lacks the specialized bodies of the masters he took them from he tends to end up with similar, often limited versions of the weapons as he's limited to using only what he has to utilize it. While Top Man could spin and shoot all around the arena due to the wheels on his feet Mega Man can only spin in the air, yet for projectile-only weapons like Search Snake he gets a version identical to that of the robot master.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a> fits even more than Mega Man, considering the fact that he's almost always smaller and less technically able than the opponents he faces, but he's goddamn unstoppable once he starts. Add the fact that <em>every game</em> still manages to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> even <em>after</em> he gets his 'Ultimate' armor.
</li><li> It's stated in canon that adherence to this trope is entirely voluntary for all incarnations of Mega Man. With their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">signature</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">adaptability</a> and intellect, any Mega Man could easily become powerful enough to wipe the floor with the rest of the cast combined and quite rightfully fear the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">corruption</a> this could lead to. This doesn't explain Bass' tendency to lose his copied weapons too despite that his sole purpose is to defeat Mega Man and become the most powerful robot in existence. One would guess he wants to do it on his own merits instead of relying on other, "inferior" robot masters' weapons.
</li><li> Zero from the same franchise is also this, he doesn't have the same adaptability as X nor does he have armor upgrades to compensate for his less than great durability, thus making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, but his skill with a sword is second to none, even learning techniques to gain advantages for his weaknesses.

This is in fact a major theme of the first and fourth games: experience and skill trumps pure strength. Snake repeatedly triumphs against the Genome Soldiers of the first game, and the PMCs of the fourth game, because he knows what he is doing and has the confidence and ability to pull it off, while the other side is relatively unskilled but has a significant numerical and technological superiority.
</li></ul><ul><li> This is how the titular hunters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> prevail against the many, many large and life-threatening monsters they face. Even the strongest weapons still take dozens or hundreds of hits to kill one such target, while the monsters can easily kill hunters in one or two hits, but through skilled evasive maneuvers, exploitation of all the right weak points, and management of the items they carry in their pouches, hunters regularly come back in one piece with the bits and pieces of monsters that are tens of meters long as their victory trophies.
</li><li> Aliens in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MutantFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MutantFootballLeague">Mutant Football League</a></em> have high speed and high intelligence, giving them an inherent edge in reaction time, evasiveness, field awareness, self preservation, and adapting as the play unfolds. This makes them ideal quarterbacks and defensive backs, and desirable at wideout and RB. They're also the weakest species in the game, with low tackling ability, hitting power, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">durability</a>. The all-alien Galaxy Chaos team has an electric offense and a solid secondary, but struggles to stop the run because they can't bring down the ballcarrier. They can't injure or kill key players on the opposing offense, either. Compare Orcs and the (nearly) all-orc team, the Orcs of Hazzard, who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">all of the exact opposite strong points and weaknesses</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> this is a fundamental part of the conflict between Sand and Qara. It is implied that Sand has no extraordinary aptitude for magic, and yet though training and dedication, he's an accomplished wizard when you meet him, knowing both the theory and practice of magic. As a sorceress, Qara comes by her power naturally, but doesn't bother to learn to <em>do</em> anything with it beyond the apparently all-purpose application of "Blow Stuff Up".

<ul><li> In the first game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Josh</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">Stan</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">Shannon</a> fall into this trope, with Josh able to more easily find items in a room, Stan able to pick locks far more quickly and skip the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockpickingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockpickingMinigame">Lockpicking Minigame</a>, and Shannon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">able to use first aid kits (on herself or her partner) more effectively</a> and offer puzzle tips. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock">Kenny</a>, meanwhile, gets a sprint, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader">Ashley</a> gets a rapid-fire attack. Notably, using Josh and Stan as one's main characters is recommended for getting through the game quickly, especially on normal difficulty, where Kenny's sprint and Ashley's rapid fire attack aren't as necessary.
</li><li> Stan, Shannon, and Kenny return in the second game. This time, Stan is the only character able to pick locks at all, while Shannon's unique ability is now that she can suck dangerous dark auras out of the environment without harm to herself (a power she gained after the events of the first game, going hand-in-hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAsYouKnowThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAsYouKnowThem">her goth makeover</a>). Of the new characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">Mei</a> can use her PDA to hack computers and locks, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Amy</a> gets Shannon's old puzzle-solving abilities. Kenny, meanwhile, has greater strength that allows him to push heavy objects and do more melee damage to enemies, abilities that he shares with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Sven</a>, while Corey is a daredevil who can climb across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecariousLedge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecariousLedge">high ledges</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrangersWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrangersWrath">Strangers Wrath</a></em>, Stranger decidedly qualifies as a badass, despite being "kinda shrimpy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for a Steef</span>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Abe</a> as well.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, Waka fights Amaterasu twice, and though he loses he urges her to get stronger. It's clear that he's far stronger than Ammy through most of the game's beginning and middle because he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shows up to help in the very final fight, and manages to block a full strength blast from Yami long enough to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a>. It helps he's been awake and active for 100 years while Amaterasu was weakened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedGoodInACan">Sealed Good in a Can</a>, but he's still just a mortal and survives fighting gods</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2">Payday 2</a></em>, the Ghost class can be this. They have fewer damage dealing skills then their Enforcer or Technician allies, they will typically wear less armor in order to be faster and harder to see, and will also use smaller guns/silenced guns to increase their concealment. But a good Ghost can open every door, slip in and out undetected, and steal every single loot bag on the map without any guards knowing what the fuck is going on.
<ul><li> The Fugitive class could arguably be considered this, as well- most of their skillset revolves around seemingly minor tricks, like a little extra concealment or extra movement speed, and at face value a pure, focused Fugitive doesn't seem like a good fit for the game. Then you pair the appropriate skills with other classes and you see how much better they are for it-
<ul><li> Fugitive Medic Bags may not reset the Downed count, but it still heals to full health and he carries <em>alot</em> of them, allowing the Mastermind's Doctor Bags to be saved for real emergencies, and a fleet-footed Mastermind with the Inspire skill Aced can run around the field reviving the entire team and have the healing supplies to salvage a potentially doomed heist, while pairing the Fugitive's Akimbo Aced skill with the Mastermind's pistol perks will make him a dual-wielding force to be reckoned with.
</li><li> An Enforcer with the Fugitive's Thick Skin can make them tankier than they already are while giving them a much-needed movement boost, with healing options to help them last longer.
</li><li> A Ghost with Low Blow, Sneaky Bastard, Sixth Sense and silenced weapons with the right perks can <em>solo</em> some of the hardest stealth missions in the game quickly, and still be able to put up a good fight when things go south.
</li><li> A Technician can make use of the Fugitive's movement boost to set up turrets and mines quickly before an assault starts, and pairing with the Tech's sniper perks with the Fugitive's Run-and-Gun perk will make them an accurate yet fleet-footed marksman, with both the former and latter setups thinning out assaults before they get too close while allowing them to quickly reach and reactivate stalled drills, or reload empty turrets.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, the Michael Persona has a full-team heal, two ma-dyne spells, repels his weakness, and learns the unique move Heaven's Blade, which has the highest critical rate in the game and will do almost as much damage as Brave Blade. However, he has very low stats that don't grow easily.
</li><li> The captains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> series are tiny astronauts that, if on their own, could be defeated with little difficulty by almost any enemy in the series. But by commanding and utilizing the skills of the titular Pikmin, they're capable of handling anything that comes their way.
</li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> qualify as this. For example, Sableye is a Pokemon with a base stat total of merely 380. However, it has only one weakness with three immunities, and has the ability Prankster which gives priority to non-damaging moves, allowing Sableye to cripple your opponent's team with several very annoying moves.
<ul><li> Sableye got some love from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Mega Evolution</a>, making it much more bulky to compensate for its fragility, and giving it Magic Bounce instead of Prankster, returning pesky traps and status effects back to sender.
</li><li> Whimsicott is seen as a better choice stats wise, but due to its Grass/Fairy typing, it's vulnerable to many other types, however, its high speed and Sableye's Prankster make it a lethal threat in Battle Spot and Nintendo's VGC format.
</li><li> The ability Technician provides a 50% boost to all moves with a base power of 60 or less, which (more often or not) have useful secondary effects such as increased priority, hitting multiple times or bypassing accuracy; putting them on par with the more common "STAB spam" moves such as Thunderbolt or Flamethrower.
</li></ul></li><li> Little Mac in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>, particularly in his NES incarnation. Pint-sized guy vs. title holders who are many times bigger and more muscular than him, anyone?
<ul><li> His Star Punch is only acquired by hitting the opponent at a moment of opportunity, and tends to be less powerful than many later game opponents' punches, which clearly shows how much the players must rely on tactics and be more efficient than their opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> Leon S. Kennedy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>—particularly if the player is daring enough to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">knife- or</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">no-upgrades-handgun-only</a> run. He's more agile than he was as a rookie in the RCPD, and he's gotten advanced combat training since then too—which are the only things keeping him alive against a literal army of parasite-powered villagers, cultists, soldiers, giants, giant <em>bugs</em>, Regenerators, and chainsaw nuts with sacks over their heads—not to mention the obligatory freakshow bosses, every single one of which is capable of killing him in one hit. Sure, he has superior firepower for most of the game—but a gun isn't much use to someone who can't put the bullets where they need to go.
</li><li> This Trope is played <em>very straight</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> series.

Their base attacks are weak, they can't regain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Focus</a> as well as the other classes, and if they run out of Focus during a fight, they're toast.

<ul><li> Old and ill and all, Gen can still pack quite a punch against younger, healthier and physically stronger fighters than himself. If Akuma is to be believed (and why shouldn't he be?), Gen's age and illness are the <strong>only</strong> things that make it remotely fair (in-story) for him to fight any of the other characters.
</li><li> Many of the female characters fit this trope, but arguably ninja girl Ibuki fits this for the girls of the game the most. She is a fragile speedster who has some of the weakest special attacks in the game and in universe many of the bulkier characters call her out for her "soft punches". She does make up for her generally low damage for having among the best knockdown or reset games in the game and being able to extend her combo's and juggles with precision and execution.

Nevertheless, as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> dossier notes, he is unusually creative and independent, which enables him to come up on top against better-empowered foes. Indeed, he was specifically chosen for the DART 6 chip because he had sufficient skills and abilities to fully make use of it, but if the prototype failed, he was only a physiologically barely-above-average agent who could be easily replaced. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His creative thinking and independence, however, makes him a nightmare for Eurocorp when he turns on them.</span>

Except for snipers with the Razorback.
</li><li> The Scout, while fast, isn't strong enough for front-line combat. Instead, the <em>player</em> has to be extremely skilled in using his speed and mobility to get in close and harass the enemy with some of the game's highest-damage guns.
</li></ul></li><li> Garrett from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> series is very much like this. He's reasonably athletic (he can run and mantle with the best of them, although he's no ninja), but in strength and combat is no match for the muscular bruiser guards or straight-out superhuman monsters he's regularly faced with. Instead, he relies on smarts and stealth to outmaneuver and outwit them all.

Linne just has thousands of years of experience and technique, and her swordplay is incredibly dangerous as a result.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, there's the final boss of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> route. If you "Check" them, the scan says they're the easiest enemy in the game and that they only have 1 AT and 1 DF, which seems to support this. However, this character is also the single most difficult battle in the game by an <em>enormous</em> margin. Sure, all of their attacks only do 1 HP damage, but they don't trigger your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>, meaning they chip off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">1 HP per frame</a>, they come at you so fast and densely that there's little time to react and even less room to dodge, and on top of that they inflict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime">Damage Over Time</a> effect that stacks with every hit you take. And sure, the character has only 1 HP, but they get around this by simply <em>dodging</em> every single attack you throw their way. When they get serious, the character even starts abusing the game's battle system itself by attacking out of turn, switching from one attack to another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashCut">in the middle of the attack animation</a>, or even just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">never taking any action, and therefore never ending their turn, never allowing <em>you</em> to take any actions</span>. This character's name is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans... turns out he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a></span>.
<ul><li> This of course, leaves one interesting implication that the game teases at, but never answers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If this is what Sans can do, then how powerful is his brother, Papyrus, who has <em>way</em> better stats than Sans, actually? You might fight Papyrus earlier in the game, but is made blatantly clear that he is holding back against you in this battle, because he is an extremely good-natured guy who doesn't actually want to seriously harm the player. When you face Sans, however, he is giving you absolutely no quarter whatsoever and applying himself to his fullest, because he sees no reason to hold back against a genocidal monster like you.</span>
</li><li> All of this aside, this is a base requirement for <em>any</em> monster that intends to fight a human and hopes to survive, due to their incredibly weak souls and even weaker bodies. The only advantage a monster brings into battle is its attunement to magic.
</li><li> On the other hand, the human child is this if you do a Pacifist run. Sparing all the monsters means that you never get EXP. As a consequence, you always keep 20 HP and your ATK and DEF stay at 0 (aside from the boosts your items give you, and not counting the extremely costly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility">Temmie Armor</a> it's never a big boost). Therefore, some of the opponents during the last parts of the game may be able to deplete a quarter of your life with just one hit, meaning that you have to be very good at dodging their attacks if you want to survive.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">Engineers</a>.

The context, however, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>, pointing out that Berserker, consumed with magical bloodlust, is so damn fast and strong that he doesn't <em>need</em> skill.
</li><li> Archer has one of the worst statistics of all the servants in the Grail War and has no divine blessings or the like. However, he is immortal, and has spent a <em>lot</em> of the time he has fighting and devising tactics that maximize his strengths <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thanks to creating copies of Heroic Spirits' legendary weapons</span>. Consequently he's able to stand up to epic legends and demi-gods like Saber and Berserker, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and when Shirou borrows Archer's power in one bad end, he even beats Saber Alter in a sword fight</span>. In spite of his Servant class designation, Archer is actually closer to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> that would otherwise be implied. First off, Archer specifically says that he wasn't originally a warrior or a hero or anything like that; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's actually a mage, the most fragile class there is</span>. Whereas other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mages</span> have all sorts of cool tricks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or spells</span> they can pull out for most everything, Archer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> only knows two types of spells, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">though what spells they are</a></span>! Moreover, unlike virtually every other participant in the Grail War, Archer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is not actually a traditional Heroic Spirit</span>. This makes him virtually inscrutable since he has no notable weaknesses or famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> for others to exploit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save, as shown other media like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> an enemy that's fast and skilled enough to catch and use his forged Noble Phantasms can easily turn them against him</span>.
</li><li> Assassin is fast but not very strong and is wielding an essentially normal sword. His magical energy is not only low, it only declines because it cannot be restored. However, he fights on more than equal terms with Saber herself and only loses because his sword is bent from blocking an attack of hers. Even Lancer, who thinks nothing of fighting several other Heroic Spirits at once so long as he is on the defensive, highly dislikes the idea of having to fight Assassin. Let's put it in perspective: Assassin's secret technique allows him to strike thrice in the same exact instant. This is NOT a Noble Phantasm, magic spell, or of divine origin; he simply trained a lot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then reality itself <em>gave up</em> and gave him what he wanted... a form of Second Magic. <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">Which should be impossible to replicate</a></strong></span>.
<ul><li> This is the central idea of the Assassin class. In a direct confrontation it is unlikely Assassin could win against any of the other Heroic Spirits. However, their skill in assassination and their Presence Concealment ability make Assassins extremely adept at eliminating enemy Masters.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Souichirou</span>. He trained in a martial arts style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">so strange that when people fight him for the first time they have no idea what he's going to do next</a>. Because of this he is able to almost kill Saber (second strongest Servant in the Grail War) during their first encounter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">unarmed</a> with a strength-boosting enhancement given to him by Caster.
</li><li> Caster herself is also unskilled but strong. Physically she is weak enough to literally get beat up by a teenage girl, and her Noble Phantasm is easily the weakest one of the eight Servants, however she is able to use guile, pragmatism and outright cheating on several occasions to become a major threat to our protagonists.
</li><li> The fight between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou and Gilgamesh</span> is a contest between Weak But Skilled and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>. Both use the same weapons, but while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou</span>'s are weaker copies than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh</span>'s, he has more skill wielding them. The result is that in a direct clash they are evenly matched with only the rate at which they can grab a new weapon making the difference, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in his Reality Marble Shirou can grab a sword instantly</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh's</span> trademark arrogance also worked in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou's</span> favor, since the former deliberately refused to use his armor or his ultimate weapon at the beginning of the fight, thinking that his opponent wasn't worthy. By the time he realized he might actually need them, it was too late.
</li><li> Generally, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">Older Is Better</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a></em>, most Servants from "recent" history (around the 1500s onward) kinda have to be this, otherwise they would constantly be getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomped</a> by their older and more straightforwardly powerful opponents.

The most badass of them all, Nanaya Kiri, only has the ability to sense the thoughts and emotions of others. Normally, they go up against horribly dangerous monsters at the likes of Vermillion Akiha or worse. Akiha's who actually know how to fight, that is. And they win. Just think if Shiki had actually grown up with them before they were wiped out and <em>then</em> gotten his Mystic Eyes. How much training can a six year old really have received anyway?

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> was a curious example. While not objectively weak (one does not accumulate 37 KO's without some amount of strength), his punching power was significantly lower than many of his peers in the heavyweight division. But while he lacked a true "knockout punch", he had a very unique combination of speed, timing, stamina, toughness, savvy and psychological manipulation, and he used all these assets to overwhelm his opponents.

Despite Sylvia outweighed him by about 55lbs, Couture won by simply out-timing him and picking apart his opponents weak striking technique. He's come back to the sport a second time and despite being in his 40's is doing quite well by relying on his skill and experience to out strike his opponents, although a noticeable drop in power means he's stopped fighting in the Heavyweight Division. This is all the more impressive when one realizes Couture was originally a wrestler. <br/><br/>Wrestling is a large part of why Couture is still competitive at 47 years old in a sport filled with 20-somethings. His particular striking style (save for in the Sylvia fight) relies on "dirty boxing," using his Greco-Roman wrestling skills to control opponents in the clinch while freeing one arm or the other to strike with. This allows him to stifle the movement of faster, more explosive strikers with his grappling skill, and throw submission artists off their game by throwing power punches in a range of combat where hand strikes are usually less dangerous. Couture makes up for the limitations of speed and chin due to his age by bridging the gap between striking and clinch grappling with his skill in both areas.

At the beginning of Gretzky's NHL career, many critics opined that Gretzky was "too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the NHL". On the other hand, his intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time.

The so-called 'crafty lefties' like Jamie Moyer and Mark Buehrle are a good example of this. Then there are knuckleball pitchers, who combine this trope (knuckleballs have very little velocity and hence take relatively little arm strength to throw, but take absolute mastery to pitch consistently), with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> (knuckleballs are notoriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpredictableResults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpredictableResults">unpredictable in their movement</a>, so a wild pitch is as likely as a strike), (the best known knuckleballers like the Niekro brothers, Charlie Hough, Tim Wakefield and R.A. Dickey didn't come into their own until their mid-thirties, when most pitchers hit the downward slope) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> (the pitch is dependent on the pitcher's fingernails to throw properly, so an injury that most other players wouldn't notice will wreck a knuckleballer).
</li><li> The above goes double for right-handed pitchers. Righty pitchers who can't break 90 mph are generally considered batting practice pitchers, as right-handers can't get quite as much of a tricky windup or funky delivery between their positioning on the mound and their own body mechanics compared to southpaws. However, pitchers like Josh Tomlin, Marco Estrada, Kyle Hendricks, and Yusmeiro Petit have been known to log incredible performances and years, with Tomlin and Petit coming close to logging perfect games, while Estrada and Hendricks both made All-Star and playoff appearances in 2016 (as did Tomlin with the playoffs). This is mainly a factor of their near perfect control, but also of their tricky off-speed pitches (the curveball for Tomlin and Petit, and the changeup for Hendricks and Estrada) that they use to create separation in both movement and speed from their fastballs.
</li><li> Petit is a particularly interesting case, as his pitch command is actually pretty average compared to guys like Tomlin and Hendricks. What he <em>does</em> have is a unique delivery that makes his fastball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">basically impossible to time properly</a>. Despite the fact that it averages 89 mph, Petit's fastball is especially deceptive because his hand (and thus, the ball) goes from above his head, to behind his head, then back out from behind his shoulder during the course of his pitching motion (from the batter's perspective). Thus, it becomes what's colloquially known as an "invisiball", a fastball that seems to just "appear" at the pitcher release point, rather than allowing the batter to follow it through the pitcher's delivery. Combined with his excellent slider and curveball (and a decent changeup), batters can't really find a comfortable or easy pitch to swing at.
</li><li> Greg Maddux was one of the best pitchers of his time, but had a comparatively weak (mid to high 80's) fastball compared to his contemporaries. He compensated for this with his impeccable ball control and trick pitches.
</li><li> Maddux is actually part of a group of pitchers who started off with solid or power fastballs, but lost speed due to age or injury (as a rookie, Maddux was rocking a 93 mph four-seam). Guys like Bartolo Colon, Jake Peavy, C.C. Sabathia, Mike Mussina, and Pedro Martinez all lost power as they got older, but they adapted to their changing outlook by brushing up on their command, movement, and/or pitch repertoire. Mussina in particular stands out, as he was averaging 86 mph by his final season, but still managed a 20-9 record with a 3.37 ERA, made even more impressive by his comeback from an injury-riddled campaign the year before.
</li><li> Another key skill for these pitchers: learning the hitters. Every hitter has pitches they can do very little against. Additionally, every hitter must anticipate what's coming and try to keep their timing on with incredible skill. As long as your control and ability to keep the hitter off-balance hold up, a pitcher with excellent knowledge of the opposing line-up can be a terror.
</li><li> Sabermetrics, the attempt to use modern scientific statistics to understand baseball, values one particular stat for hitters above all others. No, not average. Not RBI. Not homers. That statistic, On-Base Percentage, is simply how often a hitter gets on base, regardless of power. Slugging - a measure of power - is nice, but OBP is king; the rule of thumb is that OBP is about three times as valuable as Slugging. Sabermetrics doesn't care how you get on base, but <em>that</em> you get there. As depicted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball">Moneyball</a></em> (both the film and book), this led to the Oakland A's discovering Kevin Youkilis, a player who was overlooked in the draft because he had a wonky stance, decent but uninspiring average, and less-than-stellar physique. The A's took a special interest in him because they realized his decent batting average masked a stunningly good on-base percentage. He had the plate patience and self-control to battle pitchers deep into the count, wearing their arms out and getting to first base on ball 4. The book jokingly called him "Euclis, the Greek God of Walks". Youkilis went on to be an All-Star, an expert defender, and while his career .281 average is good, it's not great. His career OBP of .381, on the other hand, is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fangraphs.com/library/offense/obp/">outright impressive<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Spin bowlers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a>. A spin bowler normally bowls at about half the speed of a good fast bowler, but uses a set of elaborate techniques to make the ball "swing" in the air and bounce in improbable ways instead.
</li><li> Golfers in general tend not to be particularly strong, especially compared to athletes in other sports, but Jim Furyk stands out as an utter weakling. Hitting tee shots that some LPGA players could match in length, and a good 80 yards shorter than some big hitters on the PGA Tour are capable of hitting it, Furyk has ridden excellent accuracy in all facets of the game, and, when playing well, unfailing precision in his short game to a US Open victory, a 2nd place finish in the 2016 US Open at <em>Oakmont</em>, one of the longest courses in Open history, a few other runner up finishes at Major championships, a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedEx">Fed Ex</a> Cup championship, and he even holds sole possession of the PGA Tour single round scoring record, as he once shot a <em>58</em> at a Tour event.
</li><li> Steve Largent, a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks, was small (under 6 feet tall and 180 lbs) and not particularly strong or fast. His strengths were his incredibly sure hands and his ability to read defensive coverage like a book. By the time he retired, he'd set almost every receiving record in the book. Unfortunately for him, Jerry Rice came along a few years later to break most of them.
</li><li> In computer science, improving algorithms can cause a laptop being able to outperform a vast cluster of super-computers in certain applications. No matter how much power you have, no matter how much you optimize the code, a better algorithm will always outperform a brute force one.
</li><li> Steph Curry, the point guard for the Golden State Warriors, is not as big or tall as a lot of other NBA players but his ball handling skills are phenomenal, his passing skills are top ranked, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">his legendary 3 point shooting</a>, along with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">ability to make highly contested shots from anywhere on the floor</a>, is the stuff of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmares</a> for opposing teams. It's these skills that allowed him, in 2015, to lead the Golden State Warriors to winning their first NBA Championship since 1975 and also allowed him to become the NBA MVP.
</li><li> Animals, such as raccoons, monkeys, and such are pretty darn scrawny compared to the average human being. However, thanks to being able to move quickly, expertly climb, and a knack on how to use serious pressure with their sharp claws, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">big ol' human will lose the fight.</a>
</li><li> On the whole, humans themselves are generally this. When it comes to raw physical strength, stature, speed, agility, or even senses such as sight or smell, there are many, <em>many</em> animals that can kick even the fittest human's ass in seconds. Unfortunately for the animals, the humans learned how to use tools and the environment around them to their advantage. Humans also are a social species, communicating and working together to fell beasts well above their size, and have the wherewithal to preserve knowledge and pass it on for others to use and future generations to refine. Incredible stamina at a walk is merely a bonus - humans didn't need to fight to the death when they could just pursue the prey until it collapsed.
</li><li> Mainoumi Shuhei, sumo wrestler. He weighs only 216 pounds (for a sumo wrestler, that's tiny) and in fact failed the Sumo Association's height requirement until he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">had a doctor inject silicone into his scalp to fake it</a> (causing the rules to be changed in the process, because the Association didn't want anyone else to have to go through such a painful procedure). He was also quite possibly the most <em>skilled</em> sumo wrestler in the modern age. Known as "the department store of techniques," he was recorded as using 33 different winning moves to complete his matches (most wrestlers don't use more than a dozen across their career), including techniques that had either not been seen in the modern era or that he personally made up. He earned five special prizes for technique, and at the height of his career, he was ranked as one of the top (<em>san'yaku</em>) wrestlers in Japan, defeating wrestlers twice his size for the honor.
</li><li> Racquetball players. Suit up, go to the gym, and find a 70 year old and challenge him or her. Well wait here - you wont be long.
</li><li> Wing Chun is designed as a practical Martial Art designed to be usable by someone with the muscle mass of a stick. In fact, it's worth noting that the (possibly apocryphal) legend of it's creation states that it was created by a woman.
</li><li> In general though, many proessional fighters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">do NOT consider this</a> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Fighters like Ramsey Dewey have gone on record saying that an unfit but technically sound fighter will lose handily to a fitter, stronger faster opponent with even a little bit of training. This is backed up by masters of Traditional Martial Arts like Wing-Chun, Tai-Chi, Kung Fu ect losing repeatedly and handily to even mediocre MMA fighters.
