</p><p>Obviously, the entirety of a city cannot always be adequately presented in a work, and often there is no point in doing so, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">The Law of Conservation of Detail</a>. However, since <em>some</em> diversity is needed, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">City of Adventure</a> you happened to end up in will usually be split into districts by their prestige level. Most often, there are three of them:
</p><ul><li> The slum, often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> inhabited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCityNarrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCityNarrows">scum</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks">poor people</a>, and, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a>, it may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto">ghetto for beings judged as "inferior"</a> by whoever is in charge. Home to many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes">Moses in the Bulrushes</a>, among more malicious elements. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuyBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuyBar">Bad-Guy Bar</a> can also be located here if the bad guys are of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerClassLout">low enough social class</a>.
</li><li> The "normal" district, where different cultures meet. Often the center of trade activity in the area, as well as the place where you can learn the latest news and gossip. The people here are generally satisfied with their lives, or brainwashed into satisfaction in a dystopia.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The elite district, inhabited by the "cream of the crop", usually the aristocrats. The government, if one is featured, also resides here. The inhabitants may be shown as outright evil or simply not caring for the common folk. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity">Shining City</a>, often featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Crystal Spires and Togas</a>.
</li></ul><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Notice that this also happens in real life</a>. A glaring example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonEnglandSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LondonEnglandSyndrome">Detroit, USA</a>, which is divided in rich North and poor South by 8 Mile Road, while many smaller western cities are divided in this way by the town's railroad tracks, justifying the phrase "born on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideOfTheTracks">Wrong Side of the Tracks</a>." Do note, though, that while income levels are by far the most common means of delineating areas within a city Urban Segregation doesn't <em>have</em> to be by money lines: race (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto">fantasy</a> or otherwise), one's occupation (specialized trades like meatpacking or jewelry-working have a tendency to congregate close to each other in real life), and common tribal/clan lineage are other ways one neighborhood can become distinguished from the next (though, admittedly, differences in income and wealth usually end up happening anyway).

</p><p>When applied to a school setting, it usually leads to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyDividedSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyDividedSchool">Absurdly Divided School</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a></em>, the Elites live in the advanced cybernetic city Tanagura, while the "mongrels", the descendants of the people who rebelled against the supercomputer Jupiter's authority and thus had their citizenship records erased, are forced to live in the squalid, violent slum area of Ceres. The average citizen lives in Tanagura's satellite city Midas, of which Ceres was once part of. A mongrel who is caught in Midas is beaten by the police known as the "Darkmen" and sent back, usually broken.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">Exaggerated Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>: Honnouji town is strictly segregated in four levels... <em>according to how well each family's students are doing at school</em>. No-Stars live in the outermost, poorest levels, and are very individualistic. One-Stars live in massified, uniform apartment blocks, and all look identical to each other. Two-stars live in lavish houses and carry a luxurious, decadent lifestyle. Three-stars and Kiryuuin Satsuki, the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyPowerfulStudentCouncil">Absurdly Powerful Student Council</a></strong>, who rule Honnouji, Academy and Town, with an iron fist, are the innermost circle, there's only a handful of them, and they live without their parents. One and two-stars are <em>extremely</em> commited to the system and to keeping no-stars from rising up, to the point that <em>mothers carrying their babies will whip out a Tommy gun and shoot you if you're breaking the Apartheid</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Getbackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Getbackers">Getbackers</a></em>, the limitless fortress(where most of the important stories take place) is separated into 3 levels: Lower town, which is basically a slum and is home to all the "normal" residents. People in this town often wear rags for clothes. The belt line, which is basically the "middle class" of the fortress, mostly houses supernatural monsters who exist only to terrorize residents of lower town. And finally there is Babylon City, the top level, home to the most powerful beings in the Getbackers universe. The top level is basically a palace.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>, the segregation of Windbloom into three "layers" is evident (with the middle "layer" being little more than generic-looking urban sprawl); even though Garderobe and the royal castle are located in opposite parts of the city, they are both part of the "elite", both rising way above the cityscape, and interaction between their residents is usually direct.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has the Settlements, shining modern cities inhabited by the Britannians, and the Ghettos, the bombed-out remains of the old cities where the Japanese are forced to live. One episode shows that (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo">Tokyo</a> at least) <a class="urllink" href="http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091128040439/codegeass/images/1/10/Trains_Between_Settlement_and_Ghetto.png">the dividing line is the train tracks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>'s Paradigm City is strictly divided between The Domes, with artificial sunlight and clean air, and "those living outside the domes", who don't even get the benefit of a concise name (at least not in English).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em> / <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Battle Angel Alita</a></em>: Technocrats living in a floating city (actually, it hangs from an orbiting satellite) and a slum around a trash heap on the surface. Construction of a flying vehicle is a death sentence.
<ul><li> Considering that the floating city has suicide booths (called "Endjoy") and has a ritual where all the residents, at age 19, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> have their brains removed and replaced with biochips, essentially killing them and replacing them with AI copies</span> to create a more orderly society, the trash heap is arguably the better place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Aristocrats and shinigami live in the peaceful and elegant Seireitei ("Court of Pure Souls"), the commoners outside the Seireitei walls in the Rukongai ("Town of Wandering Spirits"). There are 80 numbered districts in the Rukongai, those with smaller numbers can be rather nice, but the ones at the end have hellish living conditions. And according to the setting, people who die in the real world get reincarnated in a <em>random</em> Rukongai district.
</li><li> Neo Verona is like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RomeoXJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RomeoXJuliet">Romeo X Juliet</a></em>. The noble people live in the upper parts and the rest in the lower ones.
</li><li> Domino City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>. On the quality side, Neo Domino City. About the same quality of life as Domino from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, plus 25 years or so of technological advancement. On the bad side, Satellite, where the inhabitants recycle trash for a (meager) living and aren't allowed to leave.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> expands on this - the City in the Synchro Dimension is a more extreme, classicist version of Neo Domino and Satellite; the Tops (rich people) live in the well-kept and futuristic city, while the Commons (poor people) live in the slums. The Tops oppress the Commons, and the only way for Commons to move up in the world is to keep winning duels in the Friendship Cup - meaning that they're serving as entertainment for the Tops.
</li></ul></li><li> They may be entirely on entirely different stellar bodies, but the lunar city of Mooneyes is treated much like the upper echelons of society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Basquash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Basquash">Basquash!</a></em> In contrast, Rollingtown is almost a modern day Earth downtown. Except for the whole Bigfoot mecha thing.
</li><li> The manga and film version of Osamu Tezuka's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> has a layered society, much like the Fritz Lang version below: the elites live in the top of the skyscrapers, middle classes on/near the ground, workers in the first underground layer, while only robots toil in the depths of the city.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em>, the rich and middle class inhabitants live in the interior of colonies, where they can enjoy simulated environments and live in well maintained cities. However, the colony's poor are often forced to live in the "underside" of the colony, which would be its outer rim.
</li><li> Goa Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has this going on. Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Ba Sing Se</a> (See Western Animation), each class is kept separate by a huge wall. There's the royals and aristocrats living in the center wall, the workers and normal citizens living in the middle wall, and finally the outside slums called Grey Terminal; This is where the kingdom dumps their garbage. The people living there basically live off of the trash, and no one living in the normal city cares what happens in Grey Terminal. The kingdom is basically described as a place where 'everything unwanted is removed'. However, this sort of attitude leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> when the royal family decides that in order to 'purify' the kingdom, they need to burn Grey Terminal to the ground- <em>people included.</em> Dragon the revolutionary uses this event and kingdom as an example of why this is wrong.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaturnApartments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaturnApartments">Saturn Apartments</a></em> there are three sections of the space station where humanity lives. The higher floors,the middle floors, and the lower floors. Nobody's allowed to go to a higher section without a special permit, meaning that the residents of the lower levels are stuck there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Each of the three Walls functions in this manner, with permission required to travel between them. Wall Sina is the innermost region, with the Royal Capital and many of the nobility living there. Many military recruits dream of joining the Military Police, in order to be given permission to live in Wall Sina. Beneath the kingdom is the Underground District, a slum built into an enormous cavern where the poorest people live in wretched conditions and are not permitted to leave. Wall Rose was essentially a middle-class region prior to the loss of the largest territory, Wall Maria. This region was a poor agricultural area on the outskirts of human territory, prior to being lost to an invasion by Titans.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the nation of Marley, the Eldian population live in walled-off slums separate from the rest of society. These ghettos are guarded by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a>, and residents may only leave when granted permission by the government and carrying a valid permit. Those that leave the ghettos without permission are subject to beatings or even execution</span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>, the rich live in Sacred Oaks, the poor in The Projects. Somewhere in between is Old Town, the city's quasi-autonomous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict">Red Light District</a>.
</li><li> The New York of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099">Marvel 2099</a></em> features vertical segregation. The city's affluent classes live and work "Uptown" in luxurious skyscrapers built on top of the existing real estate.

The hotel's interior, by contrast, is clean, posh, and luxurious when he arrives. Newark later on is also heavily worn down and filthy, and Johnny himself, being from city life, loathes being there.
</li><li> Coruscant in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> Franchise is also a vertically segregated city/planet: diplomatic quarters, the Senate, the Jedi Temple etc., are all at the top, while the entertainment district and the industrial district are further down. <em>Star Wars</em> in general loves this trope. Any city that evolves vertically is vertically separated. While Coruscant's lowest levels are home to the filth of society, Nar Shaddaa, which is a slum in its <em>best</em> areas, has its lowest levels infested with all sorts of mutants and dangerous beasts.
</li><li> This trope was actually brought up in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Candyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Candyman">Candyman</a></em>, which parts of were filmed in the run-down Cabrini-Green housing projects.

When Theo travels in a Rolls Royce to visit Nigel at Battersea, he goes through a check-point clearance gate at Admiralty Arch and travels down The Mall towards Buckingham Palace. During the journey, it appears as if the area around the Palace, St James' Park and Green Park is physically un-changed, although it has now become an exclusive gated enclave, where people relax in the parks, walk dogs (as well as other more exotic animals) and listen to a brass band play while the Household Cavalry march by.

The massive defensive walls that were being built to protect the poor remain unfinished, for the most part; with only a few places like Australia and Russia having their walls complete. Whenever the Kaiju do make landfall, the poor all huddle together inside of cramped Anti-Kaiju Defense Shelters, whereas the rich are secure behind the walls of the gated communities they live in. In the case of Hannibal Chau, he has his own private Anti-Kaiju Defense Shelter, because of an incident that happened inside of a defense shelter that resulted in a messed-up eye. Mind you, these shelters are far from ideal, as Kaiju can still breach them, like they do with the Walls of Life.

The Time Traveler arrives at such a distant point in the future that divergent evolution has transformed the human race into Morlocks and Eloi, and hypothesizes this is the end result of a society where the working-class was moved underground and the middle- and upper-classes remained above ground.

</li><li> David Wingrove's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChungKuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChungKuo">Chung Kuo</a></em> is an extreme example: the entire Earth is covered in a 50-story megastructure, with the elite living up top, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">wretched hive of scum and villainy</a> on the bottom, and beneath even that, the poor schlubs who actually live on the ground in utter barbarity.

Nouveau Paris, Haven's capital, has explicitly separated slums in the form of decrepit kilometer-high habitation towers built during happier times, where only proles now live. Chicago, the capital of the Solarian League, is even more spectacular in this regard, as it's now more that two thousand years old and is a survivor of many wars and revolutions.

There's a third group, simple farmer types, who live outside the city in relative peace and prosperity.

At the very bottom is the Underhive, populated by tribes of scavengers who live off the garbage dumped from the upper levels and generally have little contact with the rest of the society. Below that live mutants and monsters, and below that even worse mutants and monsters, and so on. Therefore, the underhive is usually considered a practical and efficient barrier between the elite and danger.

In one of the Hives from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a> background, the rich all live in the middle and particularly at the bottom, whilst the 'underhive' is actually the surface area of the Hive.

Upper Dura is in fact less prestigious than Lower Northedge, while Lower Dura is practically the Cogs. Lower Tavik's is a mix of slums and the usual trappings of rail stations, while Upper Tavik's is on par with Skyway in terms of prestige and bests them when it comes to keeping out the riffraff.

Anything resembling a middle class evaporated in short order, and LA essentially became two cities pressed against one another, one home to the fantastically rich upper crust living a life of continual partying and indulgence and the other to a desperate, starving pariah class cut off from the world by concrete walls and armed guards. This came back to bite the elites when an 8.5 earthquake shook the city in 2061, bringing down the walls and leading to orgies of violence and rioting as the poor flooded into the breached enclaves.

One section contains only Humans, another only Wingers, and the third only Kobold. The Wingers seem to be the slum section, while the Human the elite. As to where the Kobold fit in, this troper is not quite sure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> has Meltokio, Tethe'alla's crown city. For the most part, the city is as upscale as it gets, with the castle, church, and aristocracy on the upper level. One corner of the lower level of the city is home to the slums, which are populated by the poor, the sick, and the just plain unlucky.
<ul><li> The first town in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> also has this in place, being explicitly divided into the modest "Lower Quarter", and the thriving "Upper Quarter". This is emphasized in the story where the lower quarter's sole blastia malfunctions. This is a problem for them, but one can see that the Upper Quarter is chock full of blastia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Yuri</a> lampshades it and is hardly impressed with how the nobles treat the residents, especially with how for them a blastia loss is nothing.

North Estamir borders the lush kingdom of Rosalia, and is a wealthy port town, boasting a massive temple dedicated to the goddess of love, Amut, a vast selection of high-scale shops, and a very comfortable aristocracy. <em>South</em> Estamir, meanwhile, is a slum ruled by slavers, where thugs and beggars alike chase after anyone they think has money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has Varrock; north Varrock is populated by the wealthy, while its southern half is run-down.
<ul><li> There's also Ardougne; The eastern part of Ardougne is wealthy, while the western part is full of the poor and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so-called</span> plague victims.
</li><li> Keldagrim, on the west of the Kelda River is rich dwarves and the Black Guard's fortress, the east side is mostly an industrial section.
</li><li> There's also Meiyerditch and Darkmeyer. Meiyerditch is practically a blood farm but Darkmeyer itself is divided into 3 zones based on wealth of the inhabitants.
</li></ul></li><li> The dwarven city of Orzammar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> is segregated into the Diamond Quarter (where the Noble Caste lives), the Commons (where the Merchant Caste does their business), the Proving Grounds (where the Warrior Caste spends their time), and Dust Town (the only place in the city where casteless can live). Given the dwarven caste system, Kal Sharok is likely divided the same way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully">Bully</a></em> has the town of Bullworth, which has the rich suburb Old Bullworth Vale and the downtown political and commercial district Bullworth Town separated from the inner city ghetto New Coventry and the rough blue collar industrial neighborhood Blue Skies Industrial Park by a railway bridge.

Unlike most examples of this trope there is a small degree of social mobility: a battle royale where the victor wins citizenship in the Center.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>'s Vault City is divided between the Citizens who have access to high tech services and a good quality life and the Denizens who live in the slums outside the city proper and can only get in by passing a ridiculously hard citizen test (which most Citizens would not be able to pass either) or becoming "servants", i.e. slaves (but the Citizens get <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">annoyed if you call them that</a>).
</li><li> Most other places in the <em>Fallout</em> verse have no problems like this though, one of the few improvements they have over modern society.
</li><li> Similar to Vault City, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has the eponymous New Vegas: whilst the New Vegas strip is luxurious and mostly untouched by the Great War, the entrance fee is expensive, resulting in only the rich and the NCR being granted entrance. Both Westside and Freeside are slums with different advantages and disadvantages; Westside has its own militia and is largely self-dependent, but is frequently attacked by Raiders and Fiends, whereas Freeside is home to the selfless Followers of the Apocalypse, but the streets are so dangerous that hiring a body guard isn't just recommended, it's common practice.
</li><li> Diamond City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> is fully contained within a baseball stadium (hence the name), with the rich living in the boxes and elevated shacks up in the stands, the middle class in smaller shacks on the field, and the poorest sleeping outside on mattresses near the crops.

It's subtle in places like Balmora and Ald-Ruhn, but more clear in Vivec's cantons. (Plaza &gt; Waistworks &gt; Canalworks &gt; Sewers) In fact, in Vivec, outlanders are typically restricted to the Foreign Quarter only.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> features this not only in its cities, but also in the country. The Imperial City is mostly marbled homes, where most people live well. But the Waterfront is where all the poor live, and their houses are made of wood planks. Bravil is almost all wooden houses, and most of the people are working class. Leawynn (The farthest south) is nice, but the center of town is smaller homes, usually stucco (Or the Tamriel-ian equivalent) and low end, but this is territory taken from the Kajiit and Argonians, with a giant swamp nearby (Blackmarsh). Cheydinhall is nicely architectured, and most of the folks are rich here. Anvil is a mix, but the lower end housing is outside the city, along the docks. Bruma has all the poor housing behind the church, while the nicer homes are on the three tiers that lead to the castle. Overall, the farther south you go, the lower class everyone appears to be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> features this in several of the major cities. Markarth is mostly a city of gray-white stone built into an old dwarven ruin, where the middle class lives on the ground level, the nobility in the upper levels of the cliffs around the main keep, and the poor underclass lives in tunnels referred to as the "Warrens." Windhelm, capital of the Stormcloak rebels, is more conventional, with the west side of the city featuring large mansions and the east side of the city being a slum with narrow alleys. The former is home to the native Nord nobility, while the latter is home to the poorer Dunmer immigrants. (Argonians who work the docks aren't even allowed in the city in the first place). A more benevolent version is the central city of Whiterun, built around a large hill, where the business/lower class "Plains" district is located at the bottom of the hill, the residential "Wind" district is partway up the hill, and the Jarl's keep is located in the "Cloud" district at the top of the hill.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> video game. The city of Vizima is made up of the the not-visited-in-this-game but presumably elite Royal Quarter, the rich Trade Quarter, the poor Temple Quarter, and the plague-infested nonhuman ghetto of Old Vizima. Each district is separated by some very solid looking walls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts">Vandal Hearts</a></em> has an interesting version early on. In the capital city the former aristocrats who supported the reign of the Holy Asha Dynasty now live in the "blue blood ghetto" downtown. In the upper echelons of the new democracy are former members of the Liberation Army, comprised mainly of peasants. Hel Spites, the defense minister, seems to be a remnant of the old kingdom tohugh, as do his elite Blood Knights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em>, the Belladonna Cove city is separated into a poor area inner city area (where there are cheap apartment blocks, a trailer park, and run-down coffee shops), a middle-class area where the house and apartment prices increase and there's more parks, and a wealthy area above the rest on a hill with high-tech expensive apartments and mansions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoonSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoonSaga">Panzer Dragoon Saga</a></em> has a city that is divided up for religious reasons. Those who have ancestors who lived within the ancient forest (the only spot of real life for miles) get to live in an enclosed part of the village, only they can eat the fruit of the forest and they don't let anybody else to eat it. Meanwhile, outside of the wall is a whole village of people who are hoping to be granted permission to go into the city proper and also to make a living off what the elite do sell/buy.
</li><li> Orgrimmar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has Garrosh practically enforce this. The largest and most trafficked areas are dominated by the Orcs, with the Taurens receiving a smaller but still nice valley of their own. The Goblins are relegated to an area deemed the "Goblin Slums", brushing elbows with the Trolls who have been forced even further from the main city.
<ul><li> Suramar City, formerly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle">City in a Bottle</a> for 10,000 years, has the Nighthold (the city's palace), the walled Court of Stars, and the park-like Grand Promenade for the rich nobility, and the rest of the population crammed into one district that makes up a small fraction of the land. For people who though that the rest of the world was destroyed, they are not good at efficient land usage.
</li></ul></li><li> The main city of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em> is Gran Soren, which has a Noble Quarter, Craftsman's Quarter, Urban Quarter, and the slums, which are reached by going through an aqueduct at the bottom of the city. The Noble Quarter has the Duke's castle, where the extra fancy people live.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em> has the city of Sarn showing some pretty sharp divisions. The Slums district is essentially as it sounds with shoddily-built houses crammed together, the Warehouse district and the Marketplace are comparatively nicer, the Battlefront and the Ebony Barracks were apparently a plaza or park-like area before the cataclysm, and the temples and the Imperial Gardens on the north side of the city are the height of luxury. As with the Diablo II example everywhere is crawling with monsters and the Ebony Legion, meaning architecture is the only real difference.
</li><li> Kazakh City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider2014">Strider (2014)</a></em> has three divisions: the Historical District, the area where the most humble people live in, crowded in really old buildings and under constant vigilance by the army; the Residential District, where modern apartments and commodites are provided to a select few; and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto">Underground</a>, a region beneath the sewers where those who manage to escape the city alive end up, living in an imporvished refugee camp scavenging for supplies while under constant attack by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">mutated monstrosities</a>.

Before the blast, Neon City was the commercial district, the Warren were the slums and the Historic District was the wealthy residential area. The scenery changes to match the islands; Neon City is primarily commercial skyscrapers and monuments, the Warren is filed with industrial complexes, government buildings, run down apartments and a large shanty town and the Historic District is primarily residential with the buildings being noticeably post modern and detailed. However, it's the Historic District that is the most dangerous (there are gang wars in broad daylight) due to it being the center of the Ray Sphere explosion.

The upper city is rich and snobbish; the lower city is poor and resentful.

The middle ring is home to the middle class; government functionaries, business owners, and artisans.

Needless to say, this happens in real life. Virtually every city big enough to have separate neighborhoods will have posh residential districts and places to avoid after nightfall.
<p></p><h2>In General/Worldwide Trends</h2>
<ul><li> Merchant districts was a common variation. Foreign residents would often have a district with semi-autonomous status; the rules would depend on the negotiations (which would include how much wealth the merchants brought and how much muscle their government was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunboatDiplomacy">willing to use</a> on their behalf). Details of the relations might include extradition in the case of crimes by one party against another and curious things such as whether foreign women could take up residence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">thus making the district self-reproducing and changing a trading post into a de facto colony.</a> Treaty ports in China during the 19th and early 20th Centuries are a prominent example, such as the Bund in Shanghai.
</li><li> Many if not all "Gated Communities" count, in some ways enforcing the segregation with physical walls and controlled access to the nicely-manicured lawns and well-kept residences. This, however, can lead to Deconstructed cases as while such things as crime can decrease when a community is first opened, over time the community's statistics will normalize to the surroundings due to things like the pizza guy needed the gate code (which in turn allows less savory types to get the gate code). Thus, ironically, eventually people believe their community is in fact much better than it actually is. In addition, gated communities have fewer bystanders hanging around, which cuts both ways as by discouraging people being around it reduces both vagrants and the chance of samaritans and helpful witnesses if a crime does occur. The security measures are also unfortunately effective at delaying the response time of police, firemen, and paramedics.
</li><li> Cities with large numbers of immigrants from other countries often see them congregate into communities along ethnic lines, forming concentrations of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_enclave">ethnic enclaves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where it can seem like stepping into a different country within the same city. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyLocalChinatown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyLocalChinatown">Friendly Local Chinatown</a> trope gets its start from this tendency resulting in so many Chinatowns popping up across the world, but this is hardly limited to Chinese immigrants.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>United States</h2>
<ul><li> In the city of Atlanta, northern Atlanta and the Buckhead area tends to be more well of than southern Atlanta (<strong>S</strong>outh<strong>w</strong>est <strong>At</strong>lanta in particular is known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam">"SWATS"</a> in the local hip-hop scene). In the metro <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">Atlanta</a></em> area, it is pretty much common knowledge that the northern counties (North Fulton, North Dekalb, Cobb, Cherokee, etc.) are generally richer and usually has more white people than the southern areas (e.g. South Dekalb, Clayton). Knowing this, when a majority white northern part of Atlanta split off into the city of Sandy Springs in 2005 (and is even considering splitting off from Fulton County itself), this has caused many black leaders to accuse them of racism to sue the city and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ajc.com/news/lawsuit-seeks-dissolution-of-888729.html">demand that the town be dissolved<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baltimore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a> fame, is an interesting case. While the city is fairly small as million-plus cities go (counting commute-in workers and residents), there are a bewildering number of neighborhoods of varying and almost seemingly randomized class levels; a short drive can take one through areas of affluence to poverty and back again. Even in upscale Inner Harbor, the long row of "gentleman's clubs" on Baltimore Avenue presents an alarming and abrupt contrast. There's still Urban Segregation going on, but it's with smaller blocks of socio-economic groups than in many other cities.
</li><li> This is a general rule for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> — north of the Loop is generally rich, south of the Loop and West of the river is generally poor. There's a racial aspect as well: if you ride a Red Line train from one end to the other (it runs north-south roughly near Lake Michigan), you can see the racial composition of the train's passengers go from mostly white to mostly black or vice versa.
</li><li> Not within a city but a metro area: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a>'s northern limit is 8 Mile Road, beyond which are the upper-class white suburbs of the poor black city (there are some middle-class black neighborhoods north of 8 Mile Road, but this is a newer development). Hence the title of Eminem's pseudo-autobiographical flick <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightMile">8 Mile</a></em>.
</li><li> In Kansas City, Troost Avenue separates the more comfortably middle-class neighborhoods to the west from the neighborhoods to the east that are largely very poor and dangerous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>:
<ul><li> If you take the 4, 5, or 6 train in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCitySubway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCitySubway">New York City Subway</a> uptown, you'll cross a border from some of the richest neighborhoods in the country - the Upper East Side - to some of the poorest urban neighborhoods in the country - East Harlem and the South Bronx. The division is stark enough that you can witness the demographic shift at the 96th Street stop. Interestingly enough, if you keep riding north in the Bronx, the neighborhood will actually improve as you get into Riverdale and closer to Westchester County.
</li><li> The city has a history of immigration from a wide variety of countries almost as long as the city itself — within 20 years of its founding what was then New Amsterdam <em>already</em> had 18 languages spoken within its limits. Today, even just counting ethnic neighborhoods with widely-used names past and present, there's <em>three</em> Chinatowns (one each in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens), Little Italy, Spanish Harlem (mainly Puerto Rican but also others from Latin America), Le Petit Senegal, Hell's Kitchen (Irish for many decades), Koreatown, Little Germany, Little Syria, Brighton Beach ("Little Odessa") in Brooklyn, and a Little Egypt/Little Morocco (depending on source) in Queens.
</li></ul></li><li> There are exceptions, but property values in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Omaha, Nebraska</a> take a sharp jump once you cross 72nd Street.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> in the late 90's through 2007, as a result of the "family friendly" phase the city had during that time, could be divided into "The Strip" and "Everywhere else." While being on the strip was pretty safe, with lots of nice hotels, shops and casinos, and you could walk the strip without much worry, if you went more than a couple blocks in either direction, you could almost <em>see</em> the dividing line between the safe area and the unsafe ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> has an interesting one. Within Philly, the downtown area—Center City—is well-off, and things only gradually get worse after a certain point as you go further north, south, or west into Pennsylvania before getting nicer again; however, since about 2000, the "nice" area has been steadily expanding, particularly in the Near Northeast (where a lot of hipsters have moved in), South (which has benefited from an influx of Asian immigrants and general gentrification), and West (where the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University have attracted students and immigrants in a steady westward march in search of cheap housing close to campus). However, there is one area with a stark dividing line—going <em>east</em> across the Delaware River into New Jersey from Center City, you hit Camden, at one point the most dangerous city in America. The dividing line is particularly stark, because within Camden, there is a reasonably pleasant area immediately south of the bridge from Philadelphia (on account of the various educational, medical, and civic buildings in that area), but immediately north of the bridge is a hellhole that nobody who lives elsewhere dares go.
</li><li> Phoenix, Arizona and its surrounding metropolitan area has the richer denizens living in the north and eastern parts of town, while the less-well-off tend to live in the south and western parts of the valley. There are of course some exceptions, but everyone generally agrees that south Phoenix is the poorest area.
</li><li> In St. Louis, Delmar Boulevard separates the very poor Black neighborhoods to the north from the relatively more affluent mostly White neighborhoods to the south.
</li><li> In Washington, D.C., the Anacostia River represents a major socioeconomic divide. To the west, the neighborhoods are primarily middle-class to affluent. To the east, however, are many of the dangerous ghettos that DC is infamous for.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Latin America</h2>
<ul><li> When Guadalajara, Mexico was founded, the rich Spaniards built their estates in the west bank of the San Juan de Dios river, while they built their servants' barracks on the east bank that was more exposed to attacks from the eastern local tribes. The city has since grown with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Crystal Spires and Togas</a> on one side and gritty inner city slums on the other, and the separation remained after the river was piped and paved over with the Independencia Drive; to this day, when a middle class person says "the other side of the Drive"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2vlem');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2vlem" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2vlem');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in local Spanish, <em>"de la Calzada pa'llá"</em></span>, what they mean is "the ghetto".
</li><li> Brazil is one of the countries with the greatest number of gated communities, that serves as a safe refuge for the upper/middle-class to the countrys growing violence. These communities are often patrolled 24-hours by their own private police.
</li><li> Rio de Janeiro's famous skyline has favelas, which are quite poor and often full of drug-related crime, contrasting sharply to luxury suburbs. This made the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> very interesting, with several athletes and tourists being targeted by muggers in broad daylight. For the lowdown on the favelas, read the unexpurgated diaries of resident Carolina Maria de Jesus.
</li><li> Most of the cities in Brazil are strictly segregated, but one great example could be the megalopolis of São Paulo: while most of the upper-class neighborhoods are located in the central area of the city (even though downtown itself is pretty run-down), the poorer places tend to be far away from the center. Also, a study revealed that while the HDI of a rich neighborhood is similar to Switzerland , in the poorest places it can be just as bad as the one of an African country. In Rio, the vertical segregation is inverted. While the poor live in the mountains where the slums (favelas) are located, the wealthy reside below them and near the sea. (Most of the cities in the coastline tend to be like this: the nearest to the sea, the richer). Brasília, the countrys capital, was planned to be an utopian city, with its center being ultra structured and safe. But, since not everybody (obviously) could reside in that privileged area, other cities (known as satellites cities) were built around the central area, containing great levels of poverty and criminality.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Europe</h2>
<ul><li> The concept of the ghetto (from the Italian word "borghetto", meaning "little town") is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a>. Ghettoes were the Jewish quarters of the town, which usually were gated and segregated communities. They had certain degree of autonomy, and the gates were closed at sundown (the Jewish beginning of day).
</li><li> In Renaissance Italy, a great family would often house their clients and retainers around a given neighborhood in the city. Often each family would have a fortified palace to retire into in the event of vendetta.
</li><li> This is how most medieval European towns (especially those founded according to German law) were organized. City center housed the Town Hall, townhouses of rich burghers, and the town square that was equivalent with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">City of Adventure</a> "Merchant District". Artisans lived nearby, and then poorer inhabitants lived on the periphery, usually close to the city walls. Clergy lived in a separate part of the city, usually close to the church or cathedral. Additionally, in cities with several lines of walls, richer people lived closer to the innermost center of the city as the peripheral "rings" were more likely to be overrun and demolished in the case of war.
<ul><li> This is still the case for many European cities, especially ones where tourism has driven real estate prices in the city center sky high. Paris is very well-known for having a very high class center while the suburbs have high crime rates and riots every few years.
</li><li> Brussels is an interesting case, where there is segregation between the local Belgians and the so-called Eurocrats, (EU government officials also being expatriates from other EU member states). Most of the Eurocrats reside in the so-called European Quarter, which some people even call an "administrative ghetto" or "white-collar ghetto" of the EU. (See <a class="urllink" href="http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/280111-invasion-eurocrats">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for more details.)
</li></ul></li><li> The north sides of Cork and Dublin are poor, their south sides posh.
</li><li> Enlightenment-era Edinburgh was a rare Real Life example of vertical segregation, although unlike the usual trope the rich lived in the middle storeys of the tenements, with the poor dwelling in attics and basements (in these pre-elevator days, living on the 15th floor - and some tenements did get that tall - was more trouble than it was worth). After the New Town was built the segregation shifted, with most of the rich people moving there and leaving the Old Town to fall into ruin until the invention of Historical Interest and tourism.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Istanbul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> during the days of the Ottoman Empire, much of the city was like this. Part of the reason was the <em>Millet</em> system in which different ethnic and religious groups had neighborhoods set aside for them with leaders that answered to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a>. In some ways, this was pre-Ottoman. During the conquest in 1453, some neighborhoods were able to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> by forting up and then making a separate peace; just forcing the invaders to stop and take a breath before continuing the sack was sometimes enough to save a neighborhood.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a> of the Victorian Era was divided between the wealthy West End and the overcrowded, filthy, impoverished East End, which infamously played host to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a> murders.
</li><li> In Manchester, everybody gets on the 192 bus in the city centre. The majority of black Afro-Caribbean people will have left the bus by Ardwick/Longsight. The majority of Asian people will get off in Levenshulme. The people on the bus who stay on into Stockport are going to be 95% white.
</li><li> Anything north and west of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Munich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Munich">Munich</a> (which mostly is flat plains) is filled wit with working-class apartment blocks, main roads and industrial parks, while the south and east (much more hilly and extending to the alps) feature all the more affluent suburbs, hamlets and commercial settlements.
</li><li> Tallinn, Estonia, whose Old Town was initially divided not by wealth, but language. The German-speaking people lived at the Upper Town (Toompea Hill where the Toompea Castle is located) while the Estonian-spieaking burghers lived at the Lower Town around Tallinn Harbour. The city wall surrounded (and surrounds still) the town.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Africa</h2>
<ul><li> The "zoning" of South African towns and cities in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">The Apartheid Era</a> was a classic example of this. White, black and "coloured" people were allocated their own civic zones and this was institutionally enforced under the laws of petty apartheid. Although legally enforced zoning is now a thing of the past, the entrenched effects of this policy can still be seen and felt across the country.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Asia</h2>
<ul><li> After the early Muslim conquests, it was common for captured cities to be divided according to tribes. Thus, a given neighborhood belonged to a given kin-group. This system continued for hundreds of years, and as late as the Ottoman era it was common for tribes not only to be responsible for the peace of a given era but for their militia to have a section of wall assigned to them to defend.
</li><li> Contrast the districts of Makati and Pandacan in Manila.
</li><li> Although slums have disappeared in most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul">Seoul</a>, "daldongne"'s or shanty towns still exist in some areas, waiting to be redeveloped. One dramatic example is the Guryong village in Gangnam, the affluent district <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY">PSY</a> so famously sang about. A picture showing the contrast between the slum and the residential skyscrapers in the background has became a staple for those who want to pinpoint the income disparity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korea</a>. The area is now being demolished, making way for a redevelopment project.
</li><li> In a similar vein, the daldongnes or shanty towns still exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Busan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Busan">Busan</a>, and this trope is more visually noticeable here as the shanty towns originally built by the refugees during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a> mostly occupy steep mountainsides in contrast to the luxurious residential skyscrapers built alongside the famous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haeundae_Beach">Haeundae Beach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This disparity almost evokes the situation in Rio De Janeiro, but the daldongnes are nowhere near as bad as the favelas and in some cases <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamcheon_Culture_Village">transformed themselves into trendy tourist destinations using quirky charms from a bygone era<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Tel-Aviv, Israel used to (and in many ways still does) fit this trope. There are rich neighbourhoods (some of the richest in the country) and expensive residential towers in the north, industry and slums in the south (now housing a very large illegal immigrant/refugee community), and a cosmopolitan commercial center.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo">Tokyo</a> can be broadly divided into Yamanote ("towards the mountain") and Shitamachi ("low city") - the former occupy the mountainous areas generally to the west of the Imperial Palace, the latter the low-lying areas surrounding the Sumida and Arakawa Rivers east of the Imperial Palace. Yamanote was where samurai and other nobles resided during the Edo period; today, its dialect is considered standard Japanese and is the home of modern Japan (it's where the huge corporate conglomerates and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman">white-collar office workers</a> are, as well as towering skyscrapers and the latest in contemporary culture). Shitamachi was where the lower class of artisans and merchants lived during the Edo period; today its dialect is considered rough and low-class (though it also carries a straightforward, honest connotation), and the shops there are by and large small businesses run by entrepreneurs. Shitamachi also carries an image of being traditional (as in the Edo era), a recent emergence compared to Yamanote's present and future-looking orientation.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Oceania</h2>
<ul><li> The City of Manukau, a city council south-east of Auckland, is more or less divided in wealth by the suburb of East Tamaki. North of it is quite wealthy and peaceful, with places such as Howick, Meadowlands and Botany (commonly stereotyped with being filled with Asians). South of East Tamaki, however, are infamous ganglands ruled by criminal organisations such as the Killer Beez and Tribesmen. Conditions are slowly improving, but despite this, there is still a stark contrast between the two halves of Auckland's Manukau.
