Such interference includes the introduction of superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world whose society is incapable of handling such advantages wisely."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Starfleet General Order 1 (also known as the Prime Directive)</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Even without ever having met a real culture from outer space, mankind has experienced firsthand the sort of disaster that can come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> between a technologically-advanced society and a technologically-primitive and/or culturally-different one. Case in point: much of the European age of exploration and colonization included a great deal of war, exploitation, cultural assimilation (both forced and not) and even genocide across Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas, including cultures that, according to modern research, may have been more advanced than we once believed.
</p><p>It is for this reason and others that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> writers came up with the concept of the Alien Non-Interference Clause: in the future, it is believed, people will have learned from the mistakes of the past and take steps from preventing the same mistakes from recurring as humans explore space.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Of course, such rules are ultimately an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveCodeOfConduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveCodeOfConduct">Obstructive Code of Conduct</a> that creates as many problems as it solves. Crash landing on an inhabited world when this rule is in force brings obvious difficulties. Trying to study an alien culture without being discovered is a popular scenario. And where do you draw the line? At exactly what point is a species officially "mature" enough to let them in on the secrets of the universe? Does non-interference mean you're morally obliged to let a species or members of a species suffer or die because it is their "natural development"? And what will happen when the "protectees" do develop advanced technology and discover that alien races have been watching them for generations and consider themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction">pretty darn righteous for their policy of non-assistance</a>? And what should be done if the "protectees" are looking for extraterrestrial intelligence? There's also the little matter of how one defines a culture's "normal evolution" or "healthy development"; in addition to the aforementioned "letting them all die" aspect, if a society seems happy but social development has "stagnated", does that justify stepping in to nudge them in the right direction, or should you assume that they might possibly be able to do so in their own time?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A common twist on the trope is to have such a law in effect, and then come across an alien race that is <em>eager</em> to gain tech and knowledge from the humans. What happens then? Can you get away with telling the aliens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady">You Are Not Ready</a>? Where does the rule stop being about "preserving alien cultures" and start being about "keeping the humans (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>) as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">the dominant power</a>"? One ironic inversion is to have a second, more advanced set of aliens show up and refuse to help because they have this exact same clause, essentially turning the tables and putting the protagonist on the receiving end of this "benign neglect".
</p><p>This also appears as the reason that aliens aware of our existence, or even visiting our planet in secret have not announced their presence to us. Usually, the condition to join interstellar society is the independent development of starships or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>, or at least to starting to colonise other planets in the Solar System.

Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift">Technology Uplift</a>, when the aliens don't have this clause. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech">Low Culture, High Tech</a>, which is what the violation of this rule can sometimes lead to. Protagonists who tend to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!</a> usually treat this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrequentlyBrokenUnbreakableVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrequentlyBrokenUnbreakableVow">Frequently-Broken Unbreakable Vow</a>. Also the Prime Directive that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMcCoy">The McCoy</a> is frequently reminded about.

<ul><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>: The Watchers have an "observe, don't interfere" law in place (thus their species' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">name</a>). Eventually revealed to be the result of accidentally destroying another species by giving its members advanced scientific knowledge way too soon. (Uatu, the Watcher who is assigned to Earth, violates this law rather frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">in order to protect the Earth</a>, having taken a liking to its inhabitants, and he has often gotten in trouble with his people because of it.) One of Uatu's favorite methods of skirting the law when he doesn't flagrantly violate it is to simply show up to observe in person. Given that he can just as effectively watch an event from light-years away, the only purpose this serves is to warn Earth's heroes that something of cosmic significance is about to happen.
<ul><li> Also in Marvel the reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">quite real pantheons</a> of the world's cultures don't overtly interact with mortals anymore is this trope being enforced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">The Ce</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">lestials</a> so their experiment with human evolution isn't interfered with.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> gets obsessed with stopping Earth from becoming another Krypton, and fearing pollution could destroy it, he goes on a rampage, destroying supertankers until his cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> stops him, declaring that neither of them has right to impose their will on humans.
<div class="indent"><strong>Supergirl:</strong> And just where do you think you're going, cousin? <br/><strong>Superman:</strong> Supergirl! Glad you're here! You can help me! This ship is a danger to all mankind — So we have to— <br/><strong>Supergirl: </strong> Wrong! We aren't doing anything! We have no right to interfere!

Ganthet states to another Guardian that they did their job by just mentioning it to him, and it would be enough for him to not do too much. It gets echoed later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers">JLA/Avengers</a></em> when he tells Captain America he does worry about that.

Because of this on the rare examples when they do interfere they are just as likely to help the bad guys as the heroes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadPlanet">Bad Planet</a></em> any alien civilization that mastered interstellar travel joins "the Grid", and one of their laws establish they cannot interact with lesser developed species who still haven't done that.

They don't always keep to this rule and it's enforcement is very inconsistent but there's a good reason behind it, for them to remain in the mortal plane for too long drains them and could turn the weaker of their number human or kill them. This is the rule Athena uses to turn Diana back into a mortal after rescuing her from death at Neron's hands by turning her into a god, since Diana broke the rule to help her human friends.

The <em>pequeninos</em> ("piggies") are initially viewed as inferior, due to their lack of technological milestones such as electricity and metalworking. When the humans discover the piggies are aware of spaceships, and wish to become space explorers themselves, there is considerable commotion among the xenologists.

The justification for this law is it protects primitive races from other primitive races by denying them the means to wage galactic war, but it dooms the Hork-Bajir and would have doomed humanity (and many other races) if Elfangor hadnt broken it. As the series goes on that justification sounds increasingly hollow as the Andalites <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">desperately try to cling onto their technological advantage, and show just how willing they are to sacrifice their allies to save themselves.</a>

Essentially, they're in a Cold War-style standoff, which is why they each either have to agree to let the other work openly (allowing them to demand concessions) or else act subtly enough to keep the other from knowing.
</li><li> Prior to the rules from fear of mutually-assured destruction, Ellimist was fairly active in trying to stop conflicts and improve circumstances across the galaxy. When he first meets Crayak he learns, to his horror, that his first effort accidentally led to a species learning how to wipe out a neighboring one (though Crayak assures him that most of his other efforts were more successful - he just went in afterwords and undid all of Ellimist's work).

</li><li> The Istari, meanwhile, are Maiar wizards sent to Middle-Earth to oppose Sauron. Nonetheless, they have a looser version of this trope in effect, in that they are forbidden from opposing Sauron by meeting power with power; their job is to organize and inspire the people of Middle-Earth against Sauron, not to fight the war for them. Hence, Gandalf doesn't use magic to solve the plot on his own because it's not his role, and the one Wizard who actually breaks this rule has already fallen to evil and allied with Sauron. In fact, even Sauron (who is also a Maia) is not willing to fight at full power; he could try to destroy the human cities with a wave of his hand, but the Istari would stop him, creating an escalating race of magical response until entire continents are destroyed. It's far safer for everyone involved to just use mortal armies.

</li></ul></li><li> Amy Thomson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColorOfDistance">The Color of Distance</a></em> and <em>Through Alien Eyes</em> have humanity making first contact with a technologically primitive society of froglike aliens called the Tendu. They have little technology, but they do have impressive medical abilities; they can physically modify creatures, including themselves and humans, and heal just about anything. Humanity has to make reparations for burning down an important chunk of rainforest before they knew the Tendu were there, but they can't violate the protocols in doing so, to the Tendu's frustration; they know what humans have and are fascinated by it. When one of the Tendu decides to come to Earth, he responds to some of the doubts by saying that he, too, will abide by the protocols, and not teach humanity anything that it's not ready for.
<ul><li> Humanity has such strict protocols in the first place because the first sapient species they discovered reacted to first contact by essentially committing mass suicide, for completely unknown reasons. Hence, the understandable caution about assuming anything about alien cultures and mentalities.

However, there is an embargo on teaching technology without authorization by the government. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlanetOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlanetOfExile">Planet of Exile</a></em> demonstrates the point when a human is wounded by an enemy dart, and must be careful, since while the natives use no poisons, the Earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colony</a> does, and the used darts are sometimes fired back.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UhurasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UhurasSong">Uhura's Song</a></em>, Kirk gets an order directly from the Federation President and the Commander of Starfleet. To emphasize (to both the readers and the characters) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">the severity of the situation</a> (a plague that is threatening to cause the collapse of the Federation and kill a large portion of the population of multiple species), the President makes the following statement: "The Federation Council has agreed to waive the non-interference directive." That almost-casual statement is the President telling Kirk that the PRIME DIRECTIVE IS OFF THE TABLE.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantressFromTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantressFromTheStars">Enchantress from the Stars</a></em> talks quite a bit about the implications of this trope. Short version: it's worth it in the very, very long run, but <em>damn</em> does it suck in the short run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>. In the book of Job, Satan invokes a variant of the prime directive to legally bind God from helping Job and to allow Job to suffer. Also, in the Book of Genesis, when Adam forgoes God's rulership, God leaves, probably due to this directive. Then the other books carry through the theme of the hope of when God would or could intervene/interfere fully in human affairs again. (The Ransom story arc deals with this.)
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Trevellyan's Mission</a></em> series, humanity and many other starfaring races specifically invert this trope, believing themselves to be duty-bound to help guide younger races, although they go to great lengths to avoid revealing themselves. The series goes into great detail as to the criteria for choosing which humanoid species to "progress", as attempts to help an alien species at the wrong stage of development ultimately made things worse for them. Some are hinted to have resulted in extinctions. As such, only pre-Renaissance races are interfered with. On one occasion, the human scientists and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Kni'lina</a> counterparts are debating which of two <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneAge">Stone Age</a> species which evolved on one world to eliminate. The first novel specifically deals with the protagonist attempting to figure out why a world is stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> and why humanity's attempts at making changes utterly fail. It turns out the cause is a previously-unknown advanced alien race who follows a strict policy of non-interference except to stop a major threat against the very survival of the younger races. These "Paraprims" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifists</a> who have descended from primates but are not humanoids (they're more like chimps and still have fur).

However the Institute of Migration often designates planets or even entire regions of space to "lie fallow" for several million years so their ecosystems can recover before allowing re-colonization. Earth was in the middle of a cluster of fallow systems that had been devastated in a war and was overlooked (except perhaps by our mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursors</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">we'll never know if they existed</a>).

<ul><li> The novels are basically a reaction against the silliness of the Prime Directive. The Culture, especially its exploratory organisation Contact, see it as their moral duty to make other civilizations (usually those less advanced) more like the Culture (and by implication, statistically better and happier). It usually takes the form of making sure the right rulers stay alive long enough to make their world a better place; whether through alien medicine or impossibly proficient bodyguards and armies. There are factions within the Culture who feel that this practice is wrong, resulting in diaspora like the Peace Faction (who believe in pacifistic non-interaction) and the Elench (who believe that they should be the ones changed by alien planets, not the other way round). And this doesn't even count the actions of Contact's darker cousin, Special Circumstances.
</li><li> Downplayed regarding "over-runging": civilizations are classified according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels">Technology Levels</a> and galactic treaties prohibit technology exchange between civilizations more than one level apart.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear">Elizabeth Bear</a>'s novel <em>Undertow</em> has an inversion: If a planet is inhabited, humans can only colonize it if the natives are pre-space. As you might expect, this sometimes results in a situation similar to what happened in most European colonies. But that's not even the best part. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The book's major twist</a> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the natives of the world the book takes place on <em>voluntarily gave up space travel</em> and reverted to a pre-technological state.

</li><li> The very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> novel involves the technologically-primitive Medusans, who the Manticorans try to keep semi-isolated from modern tech (traders can sell steel tools but nothing powered, for instance), assisted by the fact the planet really doesn't have anything anyone wants (Apart from its location on a major trade/possible invasion route). When the Peeps provide advanced breechloading rifled muskets to assorted nomadic tribes, carefully designed so that they could be replicated with existing Medusan technology, the Manticoran governor sadly accepts the Manticorans will probably have to provide similar weapons to the more civilized (and friendly) Medusan city-states so they can defend themselves.
</li><li> In the back story of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foreigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foreigner">Foreigner</a></em> series, the Pilots' Guild (the leaders of the thoroughly lost <em>Phoenix</em> starship) want all the humans to stay in orbit in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation">Space Station</a> rather than land on the life-bearing planet below so as to not contaminate the culture of the indigenous sapient species. Or at least they <em>claim</em> that's their reason for not wanting anyone to go down to the planet. The humans who eventually do land on the planet think that the Guild doesn't give a crap about the indigenous population, and that their Alien Non-Interference Clause is merely a pretext to keep all humans in the system under their control. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that they were both wrong and right. The Guild did have <em>some</em> genuine concern about humans contaminating the indigenous culture, but that was nonetheless a pretext for their greater concern: that aliens would contaminate human culture.</span> The protagonist of the story, a descendant of the humans who landed on the planet, has as his main job to turn over human tech to the alien natives - but <em>only</em> at a rate which won't disrupt their culture or society, and he specifically has veto powers to make sure of it.

Enforcement of the rule is done by electronic brainwashing so that even if the natives capture and <em>torture</em> a visitor, they are unable to reveal anything. Note that clever ways to evade this rule drive the plots of several stories.
</li><li> The Empire of Man in Jerry Pournelle's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CoDominium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CoDominium">CoDominium</a>" future (also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoteInGodsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoteInGodsEye">The Mote in God's Eye</a></em>) uses both an inversion and a subversion of this rule. Low-tech planets are routinely taken over and ruled as colonies, but spacefaring societies are allowed to join the Empire as member worlds with much more control over their own affairs. Note that (with one exception) all the planets are lost human colonies in the first place. In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingDavidsSpaceship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingDavidsSpaceship">King David's Spaceship</a></em> some primitive but far from stupid people from a world with Victorian level technology go to desperate lengths to develop space travel to avoid being colonized, only to run into the subversion: There actually are laws against supplying "disruptive" technologies to colony worlds. So there actually is a non-interference clause but it's only applied in ways that benefit the powers that be. They actually manage to build a Victorian technology spaceship (which they freely admit would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">suicidal if there hadn't been an Imperial Battle Cruiser in orbit</a>) only to be sanctioned as a member world for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">providing Renaissance level technology to an even more primitive society</a>.

When Roane finds the conditioning still in action, her uncle points out that removing it could have horrible effects on its subjects.

In addition, other forms of contact such as trade in raw materials, or slaves, are allowed with primitives. Trade Guilds can even strong-arm primitives into accepting trade deals so long as they stick to muscle-powered weapons, which is why one Guild buys a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Roman Legion</a> from Carrhae.

It's compared to adults refusing to trade with children; no matter how clever the child is, it's still exploitative. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, there's a loophole: They leave behind some of their technology where the primitives can find it, in the hopes that they will advance too quickly, and the Ones Above will be able to legally trade with them before they're actually ready.</span>
</li><li> The Enlightened League, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YearZero">Year Zero</a></em> is made up of all alien species that survived long enough to achieve warp travel and similar technological milestones, and they have this rule. It's strict self-preservation: most species that fail to join the league do so because they've obliterated themselves in nuclear war or similar disasters, and giving such primitive species high-tech weapons is highly illegal for reasons of safety.
</li><li> In the short novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLibrarian">The Librarian</a></em> (2015) the aliens become the target species from birth in order to learn how they live, to the point that not even the aliens themselves know they're not the native species until they die. This prevents any kind of outside interference or prejudices to murk the experience.
</li><li> The dragons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonvarld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonvarld">Dragonvarld</a></em>, although not technically aliens, have laws which play out much like this, preventing them from having much to do with humanity. A breach of these laws before the start of the books  specifically, the conquest of a human kingdom by a dragon  sets up the main plot.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SectorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SectorGeneral">Sector General</a></em> series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> does practice a form of this trope under normal circumstances, but involving the eponymous space hospital is shorthand for "screw it".

If a culture is "simplex", you may import <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech">higher-tech stuff</a> into it, because the culture won't have the imagination to do anything much with it anyway. If it's "complex", you can't bring in higher-tech stuff because it could create a social upheaval. <em>Simplex</em> and <em>complex</em> aren't themselves concepts indicating technological advancement as such, more like the narrowness or breadth of the culture's thinking.

For example by them introducing guns, which triggers an arms race and trying to end slavery by violent attacks on slaver caravans rather than waiting to see if it comes about naturally as society evolves past the need for or permitting slavery.

The actual directive itself doesn't exist during the novels yet, but as it goes on Archer starts thinking it should be a good idea.
<ul><li> For is shown when the Federation's zealous efforts against the Ware, done with good intentions often leads to disaster and in at least one case thousands upon thousands of accidental deaths, because the officers didn't stop to consider the consequences getting rid of the Ware would have on civilisations dependent on it just to <em>have</em> civilisation at all (Ware = bad, getting rid of = good, anyone saying otherwise = too addicted to realize they're wrong).
</li><li> Against is mainly done with Shran, and the argument that sometimes it's necessary to intervene to prevent further suffering. He's also wary of the notion that the idea will one day lead to Starfleet refusing to help prevent perfectly preventable disasters or extinction events out of some vague notion that it's "destiny". Archer states <em>no-one</em> would be that callous. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zph4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1zph4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zph4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the "joke", such as it is, being that Archer did do that several years before... and has apparently forgotten this, and that the attitude is one frequently used through <em>The Next Generation</em>.</span>
</li><li> The receiving end is shown with an alien who is <em>pissed</em> after several days working with Travis to realize he actually is an alien, and has been flat-out lying to her face when she and her partner tried to get him to admit the truth, finding his attitude that they Were Not Ready massively condescending... but her people, who haven't even developed the concept of aliens yet, have a collective, violent freak-out when they learn the truth of the Ware, causing her to acknowledge that maybe Travis wasn't entirely wrong.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> on the other hand had most races NOT have a formal rule about such things, starting with Humans having been first contacted by the Centauri, and receiving hyperspace jump technology from them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29qje');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29qje" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29qje');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The Centauri, who were very human-looking, also apparently tried to convince Earth that we were one of their lost colonies from thousands of years back.</span> However, advanced races could and did deny technology to other races believed to be "not ready".
<ul><li> The station itself has a partial one, whereby aliens onboard can't be prosecuted for doing things that wouldn't be illegal under their own laws as long as they do it within their own species. Thus, the parents who ritually kill their son in "Believers" because they believe he's lost his soul aren't up on criminal charges; it would be another story if they had done it to a human child. Same for the Drazi who killed each other in the Green-Purple conflict during "The Geometry of Shadows" not being charged with murder. Only the ones who injured Commander Ivanova are put in the brig.
</li><li> Londo actually tells the Earth government in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveFilm01InTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveFilm01InTheBeginning">In the Beginning</a></em> that the Centauri as a matter of policy do not sell advanced weapons systems to "developing worlds". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This does not stop their enemies, the Narns, from selling Earth pirated Centauri weapons technology at a sizeable profit.</span>

Before her medication can be mass-produced, she is killed by the Vorlons. Ambassador Kosh tells an assembled audience, "You are not ready for immortality." It's made complicated in that, unknown to most of the cast, the medicine was a trap; it requires the murder of a sentient being to use, and Jha'dur had planned for it to cause the other races to fall on each other like rabid animals to fuel their own immortality.
</li><li> Epsilon III was declared off limits to all ("A Voice in the Wilderness") because the technology of the "great machine" (a supercomputer with capabilities up to and including time travel) contained there would give any one race that got it an unfair advantage. This included outcast extremist members of the race that built it.
</li><li> After the Vorlons had left the galaxy, a number of people attempted to travel to Vorlon to lay claim to the advanced technology there; all of them got shot down. Lyta explains that humanity was not presently meant to have Vorlon technology and won't be for about a million years.
</li><li> On the other hand, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Crusade">Crusade</a></em> spin-off series, Captain Matthew Gideon would launch a full spread of modified probes uploaded with the complete current copy of the Galactic Encyclopedia (which we can only assume is the 23rd century equivalent of Wikipedia) at a pre-hyperspace planet at the end of "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CrusadeS01E12VisitorsFromDownTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CrusadeS01E12VisitorsFromDownTheStreet">Visitors from Down the Street</a>", which abounds in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">X-Files</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">references</a>. The <em>Excalibur</em> picked up two agents from an alien world who are looking for proof of a government cover-up. They show pictures of Mount Rushmore and old Earth blimps. They also dress in Earth fashions from 200 years go (i.e.: from the time period at the time of the show's shoot). One of them can <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">speak English</a></em> because of information stolen from the conspirators. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>: Years before, the government had found itself in a time of social unrest similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>. Upon discovering Earth broadcasts, they used them as part of a conspiracy; manufacture appropriate "evidence", then dispatch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack">The Men in Black</a> to suppress it. The resultant subculture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorists</a> absorbed the government's critics and kept them wasting their time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">chasing "aliens"</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">engaging in civil disobedience</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDelaysForTheWicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDelaysForTheWicked">Every crime the government committed afterward was thus blamed on "Outsiders" who secretly manipulated their civilization, permitting them to do as they pleased.</a></em> Gideon's reasoning for launching the probes to expose the real conspiracy: the government already knew about alien life, and was using humans as scapegoats for unpopular domestic decisions. If that went on unimpeded, they would be a hostile power once they <em>did</em> discover starflight. Gideon's interference was motivated as a rebuttal to the accusations being made against Earth. He was questioned about whether this violated any non-interference principles and replied "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw 'em</a>."
</li><li> One minor race that embraced the idea was featured in a single episode, and everyone they met reacted with abject horror at their callousness. Other than using the word "inferior" instead of "less advanced" it was basically the original Prime Directive. They decided that humans were worth allying with when they learned about the concept of slums—they thought this idea was wonderful. To isolate "inferior" members of one's own species was something they had not thought of, and the ambassador said they would implement it on their homeworld straight away.
</li><li> The Interstellar Alliance has rules about not monkeying about with the cultural and internal affairs of its members, but it also has a Declaration of Principles that all of those members have to sign, so we can be fairly certain none of them have anything really obnoxious in their culture (like killing people for stepping in the wrong field).
<ul><li> G'Kar makes a speech in one of the episode that more or less synthesizes the Declaration of Principles (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">that he wrote</a>); it includes things like freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to pursuit happiness.
</li></ul></li><li> An important point is that none of the races now around developed hyperspace travel by themselves; they either copied it from the technology of the First Ones, or purchased it from someone who had done so. Furthermore, rather than being out of concern for a species development, technology is traded purely on selfish reasons. When Humanity was contacted we sent a few sublight probes to the nearest stars not to arrive until years later. We bought most of our better technology from the Centauri and then developed it. However one thing is clear, joining the Interstellar Alliance gives the nice carrot of artificial gravity to less developed races.
<ul><li> An interesting detail about hyperspace travel is that, according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, at least, not only has no currently present species developed it, but none <em>ever could</em>. The key material for all known forms of hyperspace travel, Quantium-40, is explicitly stated to almost never be found in systems with habitable planets. Exception of this are the pak'ma'ra, the only known alien species that has Quantium-40 in their planet and that is key to their economy as, according to Delenn, they travel the cosmos selling it.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the RPG, which isn't canon, Earth Alliance once didn't have it, made first contact with a bronze age culture... And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">observed with horror the instant cultural collapse and the wars fought to gain the favour of the "sky gods"</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Hence why current EA does have it</a>.
</li><li> Canonically, though, the Earth Alliance seem not to avoid at all intervention with other races' internal affairs, as shown in the series. The Earth fought an entire war against the Dilgar in order to help the less advanced members of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds and demonstrate their own military prowess, and in one episode the Earth government sent soldiers to help another world in a key strategic location violently suppress a rebellion, and after the creation of the Interstellar Alliance the canonical Expanded Universe mentions how the organization intervened in non-member worlds, as, for example, it helps the Centauri faction lead by Vir Cotto fight off the Drakh and their supporters from the Centauri government (though this is in everyone's best interest, as the Drakh are hostile to the ISA).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Time Lords adopted an official policy of neutrality and non-interference, acting only as observers save in cases of great injustice, after granting advanced technology to the Minyans who then destroyed themselves in a series of nuclear wars. Which is not to say they always adhered to it... or in the Doctor's case, ever. They have a whole covert ops organization, variously called the Celestial Intervention Agency (CIA) or 'The Division'.
</li><li> The Doctor, while a notorious meddler, generally sticks to "stop the threat of the week, then hop back in the TARDIS", and isn't keen on, say, 21<span class="font-s"><sup>st</sup></span> century Britain having particle guns. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E4AliensOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E4AliensOfLondon">"Aliens of London"</a>, the Ninth Doctor tells Rose that he can't interfere in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a>, because it's something humans have to do on their own. Once he realizes the aliens are a <em>threat</em>, it's business as usual. Captain Jack Harkness actually calls him out on this in his first appearance in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E9TheEmptyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E9TheEmptyChild">The Empty Child</a>", saying that he "Should've known [they] weren't Time Agents [by their poor attempts at fitting in in WWII England]."
</li><li> Played completely for laughs by the time of the Eleventh Doctor, who explains his Prime-Directive-ish policy to Amy Pond in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E2TheBeastBelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E2TheBeastBelow">The Beast Below</a>"  she turns away to digest it, and by the time she's turned back, the Doctor has zipped away to start actively interfering on board Starship UK.
<div class="indent"><strong>Amy:</strong> So is this how it works, Doctor?

</div></li></ul></li><li> A rare non-science fiction example of this trope is from the 8th season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> episode In Country, where Bud bonds with a suspected terrorist by discussing the merits of the <em>Prime Directive</em>, as both are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trekkie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trekkie">fans of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, using this to obtain useful information. (All this as opposed to an ineffective asshole CIA Officer whod advocated torture to extract information.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFavoriteMartian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFavoriteMartian">My Favorite Martian</a></em>, which first aired in 1963, three years before <em>Star Trek</em> premiered. Martin speaks several times about how he admires the achievements of humanity — the discovery of gravity and electricity, the space program — has witnessed many of them, but never steps in to do it <em>for</em> us.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em>, being an homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, has something similar in use by the Planetary Union. It's against the rules to interfere with pre-space cultures. However, as soon as a culture sends out a signal deliberately seeking out alien intelligence or builds its first spaceship, then the Union initiates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> protocol. Similar to <em>Star Trek</em>, the Union still sends in scientists to study primitive local cultures covertly. One episode deals with the ramifications of a Union officer violating this rule. A primitive culture ends up deifying the officer and worshiping her for millennia, with their own version of the Spanish Inquisition and the religious wars of the 20th-21st century.
<ul><li> "All the World's a Birthday Cake" explains that the Union steps in quickly when a culture reaches to the stars to prevent less scrupulous races from taking advantage of this planet.
</li><li> The same episode has a seemingly well-natured first contact go horribly wrong when Kelly and Bortus are arrested for sharing a birthday that week. It turns out the planet still runs itself by astrology and believe anyone born in a certain month is "cursed" to be a monster. Ed spends weeks trying to work through diplomatic channels to get his officers back but the Admirality denies it. He openly states he could easily invade the planet and snatch the pair back but that's the worst possible move to make. It takes some chicanery for the situation to be resolved as Ed makes it clear to the Union the race isn't ready to join them until they can let go of their superstitions.
</li></ul></li><li> The races of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a></em> vary in their approach to this.
<ul><li> The Tau'ri (Earth humans) reject it and hold it as their duty to help humans and less advanced, non-hostile races on other worlds, usually from aggressive and more powerful enemies who seek to either enslave or destroy them. Whilst they will gladly offer beneficial industrial or medical technology to their allies, they (generally) draw the line at giving up advanced military technology, especially when it's obvious that doing so would be detrimental either to their civilization or give their allies an unfair advantage over other foreign powers present on their world. It helps that the "aliens" are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransplantedHumans">Transplanted Humans</a> and not technically a different species.
</li><li> The Tollan follow it strictly after their neighboring planet self-destructed because of technology they were given. They firmly refuse to give up <em>any</em> technology to less-advanced races, even beneficial devices that have no military or strategic value at all.
</li><li> The Asgard generally don't share their tech with less advanced races, but make numerous exceptions for the Tau'ri because over the course of the series, they have proven themselves both trusted allies and responsible enough to use the technology wisely. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To the point where Thor convinced the Asgard to bequeath the Tau'ri <em>all</em> of their technology, when the Asgard chose to commit ritual suicide after their clone degeneration became irreversible.</span>
</li><li> The Ori and the Goa'uld flaunt their tech and meddle all the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">posing as gods to less advanced civilizations</a>.
</li><li> In addition, the Asgard and the Goa'uld have a treaty which leaves certain human worlds free from Goa'uld influence in exchange for limiting their development and preventing direct Asgard interference (they can pose as gods, though, a necessity for those primitive cultures to understand their situation). Earth gets lumped into this treaty, but they wormed their way out of the tech restriction. In one episode, Stargate Command discovered an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. They asked the Asgard for help, but the Asgard refused on the grounds that their treaty with the Goa'uld prohibited averting natural disasters. The asteroid turned out to have been artificially created and dropped off via hyperspace, but by that time Earth had to save itself.
</li><li> There's also the Ancients, who turn out to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascended</a> long ago. Where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek's</a></em> Prime Directive draws the line at the invention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>, <em>these</em> guys won't interfere with those who are still corporeal. Unfortunately, this also extends to (1) what's done with all the supertech they left behind when they Ascended, and (2) allowing evil by fellow ascended individuals, such as Anubis and the Ori (though in the latter case, it turns out that they were actually doing something about that, by hiding the Milky Way Galaxy, and weren't powerful enough to do anything more). If as an Ancient, <em>you</em> try to stop the bad guys from abusing Ancient tech, or even <em>try to prevent a half-ascended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> </em>(whose idea was it to make frakkin' <em>Anubis</em> a candidate for ascension, anyway? No, really, who?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35y3a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35y3a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35y3a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was Oma Desala, obviously</span>)<em> from razing a whole planet,</em> you <em>will</em> find yourself kickbanned right back to corporeality. There's a reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursors</a> page has <em>an entire section devoted to these guys alone.</em> Daniel only allowed himself to be ascended to the Ancients' level because he thought he could do more good among them, and is human again now because, well... he was wrong. <br/><br/>Of course, the real reason the Ancients are such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursors</a> are because the power we see on the rare occasions they cut loose means they are capable of solving the plot in ten seconds flat. The Ascended Prime Directive is how the writers got out of painting themselves into the corner with finally revealing who the Ancients are (presumably, when all we knew about them was "once upon a time, someone built awesome tech, and then the Goa'uld ganked it," the writers <em>didn't</em> have in mind a race that was <em>nigh-omnipotent and still present.</em>) They could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">finish the Goa'uld</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">deal with the Wraith and the Asurans</a>, and bring the crew of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Destiny</a></em> back to Earth with a thought — the main problems of the three series, <strong>all problems they created by leaving their stuff lying around</strong> — but where's the fun in that. <br/><br/>Finally it should be noted that the Ancients do interfere - against <em>other</em> Ascended Beings. The reason their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterparts</a>, the Ori, don't flat-out invade the Milky Way themselves is because the Ancients keep them at bay. Anubis is in a bit of a grey area here: he was forcibly "de-Ascended" halfway, so while he doesn't have all the power of an Ascended, he's still orders of magnitude more powerful than any other creature, not to mention immortal. Anubis basically is restricted to never using his Ascended powers... but <em>knowledge</em> is still fair game (because, conceivably, a non-Ascended <em>could</em> obtain some Ascended knowledge). The Ancients let him run wild with that as Oma Desala's punishment for Ascending him in the first place, basically saying "All this death, slavery, and horror he causes now? That's your fault."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, a coalition of various Pegasus Galaxy civilizations <em>wish</em> that the Tau'ri had one of these. They capture the Atlantis team to put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityOnTrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityOnTrial">Humanity on Trial</a> over the sheer amount of death and destruction that has occurred ever since they showed up. Mostly because they were doing just fine with the "get culled every few centuries" thing and the Atlantis team bumped that date up by a considerable amount, ruining all their lives. While this could be forgiven - they'd literally just arrived in Pegasus and were visiting Athos when suddenly they got caught up in a minor culling, and then shot the Wraith Keeper, which no one knew would wake all the other Wraith.
<ul><li> However, they also didn't win any points for accidentally teaching the Asurans how to alter their base-code, after rewriting them to be able to go on the warpath against the Wraith again. Which <em>sounds</em> good on paper, but after initial engagements, their primary tactic consisted of wiping out <em>human</em> worlds to deprive Wraith of their only source of food... The inhabitants of Pegasus were understandably a little miffed.
</li><li> And they were responsible for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Michael</a>, who after being experimented on to create a drug that suppressed Wraith DNA and left the human elements behind, was left with a <em>huge</em> chip on his shoulder. Michael later would use this research to create Hybrids and build an army to take over the galaxy. In at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, he even <strong>won</strong>.
</li><li> <em>And</em> they helped perfect the Hoffan drug, a vaccine that prevents Wraith feeding, but kills half of those vaccinated with it. They disavowed it, on the grounds of the mortality rate and the fact that it killed any Wraith that tried to feed on someone vaccinated with it, meaning that the Wraith would preemptively wipe the Hoffans out, just in case. This turned out to be correct, with the Wraith wiping out Hoff, and that would have been the end of that... but they didn't clear up their mess, meaning that Michael got hold of it. He began randomly administering it to worlds as part of his personal war with the Wraith, who responded by wiping out <em>any</em> world they even suspected had been exposed. In fact, this vaccine is how Michael won in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>. He turned the vaccine into an aerosol, which he then spread through most of the human worlds in the Pegasus Galaxy. Half of their populations died, but the Wraith were also deprived of their food source and proved to be easy pickings for Michael's hybrids (who don't need to feed on humans).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>: whether or not they did it first, they're the one most people have likely heard about.
<ul><li> The series has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">somewhat inconsistent</a> over where the borders of the rule lie. One fairly consistent point is that unless the culture in question is already aware of sentient life beyond their planet, or is technologically advanced enough (i.e. they possess warp drive) that such contact is inevitable in the immediate future, it's forbidden for Federation personnel to expose their existence to the aliens of the week. Multiple stories involve this being violated by accident, requiring the crew to scramble to do damage control. Standard procedure in the <em>TNG</em> era seems to be <em>inducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> via invasive brain surgery</em>. There is usually a hole somewhere "big enough to fly the <em>Enterprise</em> through". Gene Coon, who is credited with creating it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, reportedly remarked that his original intent was for it to apply only to <em>viable pre-warp</em> cultures.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth">The Agony Booth</a>:</strong> It really makes me wonder why such a troublesome plot device was ever introduced in the first place. Every captain in <em>Trek</em> history has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">basically wiped their ass with it</a>, and it really does little besides call attention to the flaws within the franchise itself, something no good story should ever do.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a>, at the very least, typically bypassed the Prime Directive by placing the ship and/or the crew in dire peril, with the only solution being one that would devastate/completely change the local society (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E5TheApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E5TheApple">"The Apple"</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E23ATasteOfArmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E23ATasteOfArmageddon">"A Taste of Armageddon"</a>), or by having the crew fix a problem caused by humans in the first place. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E21TheReturnOfTheArchons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E21TheReturnOfTheArchons">"The Return of the Archons"</a>, Kirk justified pulling the plug on the master computer Landru by saying that the Prime Directive was meant to apply to living cultures and the computer-controlled world was not one, which is a very thin justification indeed.
</li><li> Early on in the Original Series, the "prime directive" was actually somewhat less rigorous: in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E8ForTheWorldIsHollowAndIHaveTouchedTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E8ForTheWorldIsHollowAndIHaveTouchedTheSky">For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky</a>," it is explicitly stated that the Prime Directive does not apply to telling the people of Yonada that they are actually on a spacecraft, since while they may be "changed by the knowledge," it is better than exterminating them. Spock declares this to be logical. Later captains tended to disagree.
</li><li> There are also at least two rules which override the Prime Directive: the Temporal Prime Directive (prevent/reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">changes to the timestream</a>) and the top-secret Omega Directive (prevent anyone from learning of or producing the Omega molecule, which destroys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceOrHyperspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceOrHyperspace">Subspace</a>). The Temporal Prime Directive doesn't even exist yet; time travelers from the future have mentioned it, but the "current time" of the <em>Next Generation</em><em>Voyager</em> era has a whole rat's nest of (almost completely unenforceable) rules instead that the main characters routinely ignore.
<ul><li> The Temporal Prime Directive has been mentioned in a number of non-canon sources. In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekFederation">Star Trek: Federation</a></em>, as soon as Kirk learns that the other ship (the <em>Enterprise</em>-D) is from the future, he orders all sensors to minimal resolution (causing the image on the viewscreen to pixelize), citing the TPD, which urges Starfleet officers to do whatever they can do limit their exposure to future tech. Even a glimpse at the lines of a future starship can affect technological development. The two <em>Enterprise</em>s then communicate with text messages in order to coordinate their actions in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Next Generation</a></em> episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E15FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E15FirstContact">First Contact</a>" (no relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">the movie</a>) deals with the justified aspects of the Prime Directive. The <em>Enterprise</em> crew are on a secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> mission to the Malcorians, a species on the verge of discovering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Warp Drive</a>. Over wine with the planetary Chancellor, Picard discusses with him the justifications of the Prime Directive and their obligation to leave the Malcorians alone if that is their wish. The Malcorians, who mirror 20th-century humans in many ways, are undergoing cultural turmoil because of their rapid march of technology. Meanwhile, Riker was doing covert surveillance when he was injured and hospitalized: it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanOutsideAlienInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanOutsideAlienInside">difficult to hide the fact that he's not one of them</a>, and he almost dies because the distrustful minister of security tries to use him to convince the Chancellor not to trust the humans. Because of this, Chancelor Durken ultimately decides that his people are not ready to learn they're not alone, though he promises to spend money and effort on education so they'll be prepared when the time comes.
</li><li> In some instances, though, there have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> who use a similar rule on the Federation protagonists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">just to point out how douchey it looks when you're on the short end of it.</a> Big example being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS1E9PrimeFactors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS1E9PrimeFactors">Prime Factors</a>" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em>, where aliens that were entirely aware of and even sympathetic to <em>Voyager's</em> situation and capable of transporting most of the way across the galaxy decided that they had to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> about sending the ship well on its way home. Of course, part of it was that they were just unwilling to lose a potential source of entertainment that <em>Voyager's</em> extensive database could provide. In the end, groups of low-ranking crew and citizens from both sides just trade for it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">and the tech turns out to be incompatible</a>.
</li><li> And then there are the times when they do finally feel justified in breaking the rule, such as in the TOS episode where it is discovered that the Klingons have been arming one of the tribes of a primitive planet. Kirk feels it's their obligation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">to offer the competing tribe a similar level of weaponry</a> to defend themselves.
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E17APieceOfTheAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E17APieceOfTheAction">A Piece of the Action</a>" and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> material, it's been stated that the Prime Directive does not apply in cases where a pre-warp civilization has <em>already</em> been affected ("contaminated") by another outside influence. As Spock noted in the episode, the damage is done, with the civilization fully aware of aliens' existence, and the crew has to deal with it as it is.
</li></ul></li><li> By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">The Next Generation</a></em>, the Prime Directive has been interpreted to prohibit interference in the internal affairs of other cultures even if the culture is an advanced star-faring civilization. This came up during the brief Klingon Civil War, where the Federation was unable to directly get involved, although they did block and expose the Romulans who were supporting one of the sides, which helped win the war for their side.
<ul><li> Though this one might not be Prime Directive-related. Because the Admiral who initially objected to Picard's request to have ships available to block any Romulan interference in the Klingon Civil War described it as an "internal matter of the Empire" (and didn't make any reference to the Prime Directive) where despite being allies to the Klingons, the Federation can't get involved in internal political struggles. It may be that the Federation has a different policy against getting involved in a costly war, whether the Prime Directive applies or not. Though if the Romulans on the other hand were not sneakily supporting the Duras family in the Klingon Civil War and instead decided to use this opportunity to attack the Klingon Empire, the Federation by treaty would declare war against the Romulan Empire (which by secretly supporting the Duras, is something the Romulans are actively trying to avoid).
</li></ul></li><li> And ultimately, we learn that the Federation's Prime Directive is derived from the Vulcans, who would not have made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> had they not observed humanity's first warp drive flight.
</li><li> Disturbingly invoked (and possibly incorrectly at that) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS1E3TimeAndAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS1E3TimeAndAgain">Time and Again</a>". Janeway and Paris are stranded on a pre-warp (but still advanced) planet that is using a source of energy that will literally wipe out all life on the planet the next day. Despite Paris's wish to warn them, Janeway orders him not to, citing the Prime Directive... despite the fact that this interference would literally save everyone and doesn't seem to contradict the actual Prime Directive.
</li><li> Also seen in TNG "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E15PenPals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E15PenPals">Pen Pals</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E12Homeward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS7E12Homeward">Homeward</a>". In those cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">extinction was part of the culture's "natural development," and in the former case Picard decided that they had to intervene upon a direct plea for help from the planet.</a>
<ul><li> Whether you agree with Picard's reasoning or not, "Pen Pals" was one of the only episodes of Trek where a non-dogmatic discussion of the PD takes place. Picard unintentionally admits at the end of their discussion that it's a flawed ideology that nobody in the room is comfortable or satisfied with — which doesn't stop them from continuing to use it as gospel anyways.
</li></ul></li><li> TOS' "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E3TheParadiseSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E3TheParadiseSyndrome">The Paradise Syndrome</a>" indicated that the Starfleet of the time disagreed — the <em>Enterprise's</em> mission is to prevent an extinction-event asteroid strike (but still without revealing themselves to the natives). Evidently, Starfleet re-interpreted the Prime Directive to no longer be a shield for less developed cultures but rather a dogma at some point between TOS and TNG.
</li><li> In the TNG episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS1E21Symbiosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS1E21Symbiosis">Symbiosis</a>", the Ornarans are suffering from a fatal disease and are dependent on medicine provided by the Brekkians, but this has led to the Ornaran society falling apart, while the Brekkians have become so wealthy from the profits that they have centered their entire society on exploiting the Ornarans. It doesn't take long for Dr. Crusher to realize the disease was cured ages ago, and that they were suffering from the withdrawal symptoms; the "medicine" is actually a highly addictive drug. She wants to put an end to this, but Captain Picard points to the Prime Directive, saying they cannot interfere. Picard then points out they can't interfere to maintain the status quo either. The Ornaran ships were no longer able to make supply runs for the medicine, and they wanted the <em>Enterprise's</em> help in repairing their fleet; by refusing, the Ornarans would have to face the withdrawal and hopefully get over it on their own. This is despite the fact that the Prime Directive shouldn't apply to the situation <em>at all</em>, since this is neither a case of a pre-first contact civilization (by definition, the Ornarans and Brekkians have already made contact with each other) nor a purely internal affair of one civilization (the entire conflict is regarding the interaction between two entirely separate civilizations). By the incredibly flimsy justification that Brekkians "centered their entire society around exploiting the Ornarans", the Prime Directive would prohibit Starfleet from defending anyone from attack by the Orions (whose entire society is centered around piracy), the Borg (whose entire society is centered around assimilating other civilizations) or the Dominion (whose entire society is centered around military conquest).
<ul><li> Picard's reasoning was definitely not helped by the fact that he didn't invoke his interpretation of the PD until after he learned of the exploitative relationship. Up until that point he was hours away from returning them to their status quo. Under his 11th-hour interpretation he should never had answered their distress call in the first place and let the Ornaran freighter crash.
</li></ul></li><li> The alien Organians from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a> had evolved into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> and preferred not to interfere in the affairs of lower lifeforms including the Federation. Part of it was a desire to not interfere in a species' natural development. A big part was they found interacting with other lifeforms disgusting since they could not stand any pain or violence and evolved specifically to get away from it. They only stopped the Klingon-Federation War because they found the potential bloodshed even worse. They eventually stopped enforcing the peace though the reasons why vary from losing interest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> reasons of being somehow removed from this universe.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> episode involves the <em>Enterprise</em> finding a pre-warp race that is dying from species-wide genetic disorder. They have met other warp-capable cultures (the Ferengi were one of them), who were unable (or unwilling) to help them either with the cure or with achieving warp flight. Phlox manages to find the cure but in the process discovers that there is another sentient race living on the same world who are being deliberately kept down by the dying race. He argues to Archer that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodEvolution">evolution is killing off one race to raise another (try not to head-desk at that)</a>. While Archer initially dismisses Phlox's concerns and prepares to hand them the cure, he eventually agrees that it's not up to him to play God. Mind you, this is before the Prime Directive, which he lampshades by commenting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">maybe someday they'll come up with one</a> to tell captains like him what to do in these situations. He also refuses to give them warp technology, but only because it would be irresponsible to give it to someone with no experience handling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">antimatter</a>. Basically, the episode canonizes the Prime Directive and everyone who invokes it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadInTheSandManagement">Head-in-the-Sand Management</a>.
<ul><li> A few other ENT episodes involve them finding primitive cultures and exploring them without interference. On one of them they stop a group of off-planet criminals who are poisoning the local water supply. On another, a thief steals a communicator from a member of the (disguised) landing party, forcing them to come back to retrieve it, only to be captured by the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> suspecting them of being spies for their enemies. Human technology and various biological differences baffle the captors, but Reed manages to convince them that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> genetically-engineered by their rivals. They manage to escape with the communicator, only for Archer to grimly point out that they have already interfered in local affairs. Now they think that their enemies are growing an army of Super Soldiers with advanced weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> And then we have one of the more reprehensible applications of the Prime Directive when the Bajorans are introduced in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E3EnsignRo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E3EnsignRo">Ensign Ro</a>", with the Federation refusing to involve itself in the Cardassian Occupation of Bajor on grounds that it's an internal political matter, despite the fact that the Federation was in open warfare with the Cardassians for much of the latter half of the Occupation. To their credit, once the Bajoran Resistance finally forces the Cardassians off the planet, the Federation is quick to step in with reconstruction aid and naval protection. Like the Klingon Civil War, this may be a case where the Federation can't go around getting involved in every conflict in the galaxy.
</li><li> There's also one case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> where Ben Sisko uses the Prime Directive as an excuse for not endorsing Kai Winn Adami as a candidate for First Minister of Bajor, stating that Starfleet regulations forbid him from becoming involved in internal political matters. Unstated is that he plain doesn't like her and wouldn't endorse her even if he <em>could</em>. In fact the core conflict for his character in the early seasons was that he was both forbidden to interfere in their internal affairs while <em>also</em> acting as the emissary for their gods at said gods' request.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a short video, the Kelpiens are a primitive race being exploited by the predatory Ba'ul, who periodically demand that a number of Kelpiens voluntarily submit to being slaughtered and eaten in exchange for not hunting them to extinction. Despite the Ba'ul being a spacefaring race, Starfleet still refuses to do anything to help the Kelpiens, citing the Prime Directive. When Saru modifies a piece of Ba'ul tech into a communicator and contacts the USS <em>Shenzhou</em>, they permit Captain Georgiou to communicate with him and eventually send her to extract him from the planet, provided he agrees that he would never attempt to return home. She explains that the only reason she was allowed to do even that is because Saru has demonstrated extraordinary intelligence by modifying a piece of alien tech into a working interstellar communication device.
</li><li> According to Captain Pike, the Prime Directive also applies to certain human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colonies</a>.

The UP3 was made with good reason, even if only a handful of the architects of it knew the real reason why it was put in place - someone <em>did</em> destroy a planet by providing advanced tech, and became the main architect of the UP3 as a result. Which may be somewhat of a plot hole when you consider that in the rules of the UP3, a 20th century world can be upgraded from "Protected Planet" (no interference) to "Developing Planet" (eligible for contact and technological uplifting). The planet that was destroyed leading to the creation of the UP3 was mid-20th century. On the other hand, it can also be interpreted as cooler heads prevailing, and realizing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">one guy feeling guilty</a> about picking up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and giving <em>antimatter</em> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who blows up her planet with it doesn't mean other worlds can't be contacted in a more reasonable manner.

<ul><li> The one known case where they forcibly annexed an underdeveloped world, Roak, was to protect its inhabitants from outside interference and possible extinction at the hands of another developed power (which kick started the plot of First Departure, though the annexation happened decades after that game).
</li><li> In another case, it is pointed out that active outside interference was already happening, and they needed to put a stop to it, even if it meant violating the letter of the law (Integrity and Faithlessness).

<ul><li> While none of the civilizations of the verse have such a rule, salarian scientist Mordin Solus holds the view that there <em>should</em> be one, citing the fiasco with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">krogan</a> as an example. Background: as a primitive species, the krogan had been given advanced technology to help turn around a losing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Bug War</a> against the rachni. But the krogans' prodigious birth rate (previously balanced out by the fact that they came from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> where only <em>one in a thousand</em> krogan survived to reach adulthood), combined with their natural aggression, led to them turning around and becoming as much of a menace to other sapient species as the aforementioned rachni. It took the "genophage" sterility plague to keep them from overrunning the galaxy.

Then they ran into the yahg, a species even more brutal than the krogan, who massacred the first contact team. This led to the Council "blockading" the planet, preventing anyone getting off it. (With one exception, an individual that was snuck off-planet possibly as a sort of living trophy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The sneaker was the Shadow Broker, and that yahg took his place by killing him and remained on that throne for sixty years until Liara came along.</span>) So while they don't hold a general rule requiring it, they do seem to adopt this policy on a case-by-case basis.

The turians first discovered humanity trying to activate an uncharted mass relay, and intervened because doing so is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">a major faux-pas</a>: the last time someone did it, they found the rachni, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">ended well</a>. Of course, instead of <em>contacting</em> the humans and explaining what was going on (how was pre-contact humanity <em>supposed</em> to know an unknown Galactic Law prevents them from tinkering with the relays?), the turians opened fire instead. This started a three-month-long conflict which humans call "the First Contact War" and turians "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Relay 314</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">Incident</a>."

The Council was naturally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">furious</a></em> to find out that the turians had performed a pre-emptive strike on an unknown species <em>without</em> getting authorisation.

Violators can face everything up to and including the might of UEE's military forces. Unfortunately, as the UEE becomes overextended over time, universal enforcement of the act proves difficult.
</li><li> The Protoss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> had this policy ever since an incident with a minor race called the Kalath.

The Protoss even considered the warp-capable Terrans to qualify as a lesser race under that policy and only revealed themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">"purify"</a> Terran colonies that became infested by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Zerg</a>, because while the Terrans weren't a threat, the Zerg <em>were</em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, the protagonists have a self-imposed "No meddling" rule that's summarized as "Don't let anybody know you're from another world" and "Don't interfere in the normal affairs of the world you're visiting". They refer to it as "keeping the world order." The only exceptions allowed is when it would go against not stopping the bad guys which are using dimension-invading monsters you're supposed to be fighting. This rule is mostly forgotten in subsequent games, mostly because the villains have meddled <em>so much</em> that the jig is already up, and not meddling further would probably lead to the collapse of the universe. In an interesting twist, the villains actually play to this more than the heroes do, at least in <em>358/2 Days</em> where several levels have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth Based Missions</a>. By the time of <em>II</em>, however, their plan is almost complete and they can afford to be much more open in their manipulations. It comes up again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> though, to the point that "Order" is even one of the entries in the game's glossary. The world order is also the reason why when visiting certain worlds, Donald uses his magic to transform the party. In other words, when visiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monstropolis</a> the entire party becomes monsters and when visiting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">Pride Lands</a> they become various animals, with Sora as a cute little lion cub.

While they adhere to the "don't tell locals about other worlds" part of the rule, they have free reign to act openly otherwise due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Unversed</a> invasion (it's implied that they'd be forbidden to interfere otherwise). Terra <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up violating the clause-such as it is-by telling a young Riku about the world outside Destiny Island and even <em>passes the ability to wield the Keyblade to him</em>, setting him up for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> at the beginning of the series</span>.

While Xenophobic empires may do anything they want to pre-FTL races except uplift, up to and including covert or overt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">invasion</a>.
</li><li> Discussed at some level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em>. General Pepper tells gung-ho trigger-happy Fox McCloud he can't use his blaster in Dinosaur Planet because the mission is not about "blowing [the planet] up." Luckily for Fox, he happens to find Krystal's staff nearby, letting him fight in some way. However, General Scales' army is outright using highly-advanced technology which Fox at times uses against them. Due to being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a> involving Drakor originally being the supplier, it's not elaborated upon.
<ul><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAssault">Star Fox: Assault</a></em>, Sauria (retconned from "Dinosaur Planet") still remains as an underdeveloped planet, but Team Star Fox is forced to come in with guns blazing due to the Aparoids laying waste to the planet, making it impossible to suggest using rudimentary options to deal with them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>, we find out that this is the main reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Iconians were nearly killed off: they had incredible technology and lesser races wanted it. However, the Iconians feared they would use it for terrible purposes and refused to allow them access at that scale if they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady">sufficiently advanced enough</a>. However, the races grew insanely jealous and thought the Iconians arrogant, thus they ended up bombarding Iconia in order to get the technology. They didn't succeed</span>.
<ul><li> Prior to this, there's a set of missions involving the Vaadwaur and the Kobali. The Alpha Quadrant Alliance (The Federation, the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Republic) are called to Kobali Prime, the new home of the Kobali people. There, they learn the Vaadwaur are attacking the planet for an unknown reason. Captain Harry Kim (yeah, <em>that</em> Harry Kim) smells something fishy and tries to investigate, but is warned of the Prime Directive. Ultimately, they find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kobali Prime is actually a Vaadwaur world, the Kobali are reviving dead Vaadwaur to become Kobali themselves and the Vaadwaur are not happy at this</span>. Harry decides to take action, but when he's told of the Prime Directive again, he tells the person that it's kinda-sorta too late at this point.
</li><li> Earlier than that, a Federation captain is tasked to join a conference between the Romulan Star Empire and the Federation when it seems Empress Sela wishes to mend bridges after the Federation decided to back the fledgling Romulan Republic as the Empire had been painting the Republic as a bunch of terrorists trying to destabilize the peace. One Romulan ambassador snidely calls you out for siding with the Republic, as the Prime Directive states that they can't get involved with the political disputes of non-Federation worlds. The captain just sidesteps the accusation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, this is a belief (though seemingly not a true rule) of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Psijic Order</a>, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Magical Society</a> and the oldest monastic order in Tamriel. While they do offer to serve as advisors (a sacred duty which they call "seliffrnsae," meaning "grave and faithful counsel",) they do not intervene in the affairs of other groups, preferring to let events play out from afar. The few times they've violated this have been to avert events with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> level consequences (such as sinking the Maormer fleet and confiscating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Eye of Magnus</a>). They've even been known to remove all trace of Artaeum, their home island, from the physical world during times of extreme political chaos presumably so no one group could attempt to use them against another.

</li><li> When the company has to leave, they leave behind an Uplift robot to bring the humanoids up to a modern standard of living in just a few generations. Unfortunately, the natives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppeaseTheVolcanoGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppeaseTheVolcanoGod">toss it into a volcano in an attempt to bring the mercenaries back</a>.

Mariner's problem is that trying to solve things involving the Prime Directive and other things just takes <em>too long</em> with the Federation's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBeauracracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBeauracracy">Vast Beauracracy</a> and she'd rather solve things <em>now</em>. The next episode has Freeman realize that the Prime Directive has problems. For example, the people of Beta III are back to worshiping Landru, and the main crisis of the episode involves the "walking joke" Pakleds suddenly being highly dangerous. Freeman says afterwards that there problems could have been avoided had Starfleet bothered to check back more frequently rather than let the Prime Directive limit them.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples">list of peoples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who have kept culturally isolated or were until fairly recently. Most of them have an estimated 300 or fewer people (which is not a sustainable population without massive problems due to inbreeding). In general, uncontacted people are left alone to protect them from disease, or because they are actively hostile.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermiParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermiParadox">Fermi Paradox</a> is the unresolved question of why we haven't had aliens visiting since before we even evolved into modern humans. After all, our sun is relatively young, and there would have been more than enough time since the beginning of the universe for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower">Galactic Superpower</a> to have formed. One answer is the "zoo hypothesis," which states that aliens are under some equivalent of the Prime Directive. Or, less benignly, that they want us to stay lab rats, or not become a potential rival. Though others have suggested that aliens aren't interfering with us because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet">we're just not that interesting</a> and a third that believes it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">they get wiped out before reaching the technological capacity to travel interstellar distances.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASA">NASA</a> once prevented the <em>Galileo</em> probe, which was exploring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jupiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, from crashing into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoonsOfJupiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoonsOfJupiter">the moon Europa</a>. Europa has a chance of holding life, and they don't want risk "infecting" the moon with microbes from Earth, which could kill all life on Europa before it is even confirmed to exist. (They de-orbited <em>Galileo</em> into Jupiter instead.). The <em>Cassini</em> spacecraft was also deorbited into Saturn on September 2017 to avoid contamination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoonsOfSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoonsOfSaturn">the moon Enceladus</a>, known to have a subsurface water ocean. <em>Juno</em>, a probe currently orbiting Jupiter, will suffer the same fate for the same reasons once its mission ends. For the protection of any ecosystems that might exist on possibly life-bearing worlds, there exist specific international rules governing how "clean" spacecraft must be if they are going to contact such worlds. NASA has Planetary Protection Officers charged with overseeing the compliance with these rules. (<em>Galileo</em> and <em>Cassini</em> would have been in the least strict classification, being remote sensing platforms that would not be expected to physically contact a possibly life-bearing world. The <em>Huygens</em> lander was in a higher category, since it was to land on a world we cannot be certain contains no life of any kind. A lander like <em>Viking</em> is in the most strict category, since it needs to be both clean enough to not risk contaminating the target world, but also its own life-detecting experiments. This is required because it was proven with the portions of the Surveyor 3 probe recovered by Apollo 12 that microbes can survive for years in protected spots inside spacecraft otherwise exposed to open space.)
</li><li> Laws established for the protection of endangered species often require that they be left entirely undisturbed by humans, even when taking action might preserve individual members of that species (e.g. letting baby sea turtles crawl into the sea without help). Like the Prime Directive, this can have bizarrely inconsistent effects. Areas are made inaccessible to development because they are an edge territory for a protected species, while the nearby area where they thrive has no protection at all.
</li><li> Surtsey. A volcanic island that emerged from the Atlantic off the southern coast of Iceland in November 1963 as a result of an underwater volcano eruption. As it offered an incomparable opportunity to study the process of biocolonization of the completely barren and dead rock, it is strictly protected from any human intervention. Only a few scientists ever set foot on Surtsey, all in heavy protective gear designed so that not a single plant seed or a piece of moss or fungi could adhere to it, to prevent accidental introduction of a new lifeform on the island; it was mostly studied from the air, and the pilots of the planes carrying scientists were instructed not to land on the island, but ditch as far away as possible in case of potential emergency (none happened so far).
