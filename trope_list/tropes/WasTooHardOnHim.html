Sometimes, doing the right thing doesn't always mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">it's the nice thing.</a> Many of these things can be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">scolding someone</a> for doing something that is either stupid or wrong, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">physically harming another</a> for seemingly in the verge of losing control of himself, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompassionateCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompassionateCritic">criticizing someone's abilities just to motivate them to do better</a>. After doing the deed, there's an uncomfortable feeling inside the character, and that feeling is regret for doing what he needs to do.

The parent steps in and give him a harsh scolding or even an old-fashioned spanking. As soon as the parent is finished disciplining him, the parent feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">guilty</a>, asking themselves "Am I being too hard on him?" Another character, usually the parent's friend, will respond by either criticizing him and arguing that they could've been more lenient with their child or assure them they really are doing the right thing, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyWayTheyWillLearn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyWayTheyWillLearn">the only way little Timmy will learn</a>. Sometimes, it can be the other way around with the friend asking the parent the aforementioned question. Either way, it's undeniable that the hardest thing parents must do is to discipline their children.
</p><p>Using this trope, it can vary between a character who feels bad for scolding or punishing another character in a way that is far more excessive than usual and when they feel bad for scolding or punishing them in a manner that is appropriate.

Even though he (along with Potsie and Ralph) were trapped inside and had to be rescued during the fire and could have been killed, several of the others believe Fonzie went too far when he yelled at Chachi, who had said he was sorry and begged for forgiveness and — in the judgment of others — had sufficiently shown remorse and guilt.
