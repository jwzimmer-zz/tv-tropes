This is often present in videogames because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">functionality</a>, in that there will be things you need to be able to do immediately in order to actually proceed, like attack, but the holding-your-breath sidequest (or the using-a-pocketknife necessity, for a more likely example) doesn't come until much later.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BunnyMustDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BunnyMustDie">Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils</a></em>, the main character Bunny starts the game facing left and <em>can't turn around</em> without a special item enabling her. Note the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> there — she can walk right just fine, if she gets forced to face that direction, but then she loses the ability to turn around and face left, and due to typical platform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpPhysics">Jump Physics</a> she can still move right in the air without turning around. The existence of a distinction between turning and moving forward is odd enough in a platformer, and the finer points of controlling Bunny so dependent on it, that the "Gears of the Past" exist mostly to force people to notice it. That it enables players to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfIMposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfIMposedChallenge">try beating the game without the item</a>, and also foreshadows a plot point (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bunny has been moving through time as much as space to get to this cave because she's being positioned to free the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and so isn't facing in a purely "spatial" direction until the gears rectify this</span>) are bonuses.
</li><li> One of the complaints against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a></em> was that you needed to find a power-up in order to <em>run</em>. On the plus side, said powerup was 5 minutes into the game. The minus side is the enemy guarding it is quite difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss">because you can't run yet</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em>, you need a relic to backdash and another to do a downward kick after a double jump. Sounds fine, but in pretty much every other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> the backdash is had from the very beginning, and you can automatically kick after a double jump once you get the double jump. At least Soma isn't supposed to be a highly-trained vampire hunter, so it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">makes more sense</a> than the <em>Circle of the Moon</em> example, but it's still quite aggravating. He retains the backdash and drop kick in the sequel, so he at least didn't suffer <em>completely</em> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">loss of his souls</a> in the intermission.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>, Alucard has to find the Cube of Zoe relic in order to... find items from destroyed candles. That said, hearts, money and <em>axes</em> popping out of destroyed candles is highly implausible in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, so perhaps all other characters had that relic with them already. Inverted by Alucard's spells; you can do those simply by getting the button combinations right, with no need to buy the scrolls that teach them to you.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em>, where Johnathan and Charlotte need the Push Cube relic to push heavy items out of the way. Said relic is found about 12 inches away from the first object in the game that can be pushed (an empty stagecoach).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em> requires you to find 10 coins to purchase <em>the ability to save the game</em>. Even as a homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> retro games, that's pushing it. The remake removes this requirement.
<ul><li> Also unusual is that your archaeologist character can't <em>read</em> (not even signs written in his language) without buying a gadget for his laptop computer. It's not nearly as cheap as the game-saving item. The device that translates the glyphs costs even more money on top of that, and in this game you won't get far without it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> gives the player character the option to buy an ability that lets her <em>pee</em>. For 20 times the price, she gets a more useful ability. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungFu">Poop</a>. Kinda makes sense, since it's <em>exploding</em> poop.
</li><li> Lara Croft's skill tree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider (2013)</a></em> includes the ability to use her climbing axe for stealth kills and melee attacks. Some of her abilities in this game are clearly meant to reflect her mental willingness to actually do things as opposed to the inability to do them. However, she's perfectly willing to garrote enemies with her bow much earlier in the game. This is more likely to break her limited equipment and it's also a much more difficult way to try and kill someone than using a sharp metal tool designed to stick into things anyway.
</li><li> Several useful abilities are granted to you in cutscenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfMana">Sword of Mana</a></em>. Once again, these include sitting.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana">Legend of Mana</a></em> is kind enough to start you out with the ability to sit. The ability to slide, tackle, and taunt, however, require intense training to discover.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p2lz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0p2lz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p2lz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can actually perform them from the start of the game, by combining the two abilities that eventually unlock one of the "advanced" abilities and using them at the same time, but getting the ability itself still takes quite a while.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DLCQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DLCQuest">DLC Quest</a></em> deconstructs this within an inch of its life. You have to collect coins in-game to buy DLC. Literally everything other than the existence of a horse, planet, and people must be bought before it can be used. Want to spin the grindstone? Buy the ability from the shop. Want to cut down bushes in your way? Buy it from the shop. Want to move left and jump? Buy it from the shop. Want to have animation? Buy it from the shop. Want to PAUSE? BUY IT FROM THE SHOP.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames">freeware</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastWord">Last Word</a></em>, the protagonist, Whitty Gawship, needs to purchase levels in wine-tasting from a cat before she can try those fine wines for herself.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> series of games, being a hybrid of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame">Adventure Game</a> with RPG elements, had this on occasion. If your character started with zero points in a skill, such as climbing, then they could never get better at it no matter how many times you tried to climb that tree. Although sometimes you could learn a skill by reading a book. In the fifth game, your character has to read a book about swimming to get over his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1q1ax');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1q1ax" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1q1ax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The player learning new skills by reading a book is exactly in character with the rest of the series, as the Hero became an adventurer through a <em>correspondence school</em>. He also learns swimming from the same guy that runs the school.</span>

Some of them, like the Helm Splitter or Mortal Draw, are complex enough that it makes sense that he'd have to learn then from somewhere. On the other hand, there are techniques like "Stab an enemy when he's on the ground" or "smack the enemy with your shield", which you'd think he'd be capable of figuring out on his own. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> goes ahead and gives Link access to those attacks from the start.

Everything else is understandable as the story focuses on Jason as a nobody with no combat experience who gains experience during his adventure. Presumably the tattoo gives him the courage to hold on to the grenade for a little bit longer and the agility to jump into a slide from a sprint without breaking a hip.

Even without the perk, you can eat "Human meat" dropped off Feral Ghouls, with no loss to your Karma (as opposed to regular cannibalism through the perk.)

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> does shed some light on the power armor training requirements, since now each suit is a walking tank that folds around and encapsulates the player. It looks like getting it wrong would result in losing a limb. Of course, this raises more questions, seeing as almost anyone else in the game can still use it. At least the Player has good reason to know how to use it, though; both characters are heavily implied or outright stated to be veterans of the Sino-American War in Alaska(with one theory being they actually met in said war), so they would logically know how to use the Americans' power armour, and it's not unbelievable that other variants wouldn't be more advanced. And actually encountering enemies with power armour(outside of groups like the Brotherhood who specialise in it) in the game is infrequent enough to be considered a minor boss battle in most cases and so it's not unbelievable that those rare individuals somehow learned how to use it, with the furthest belief stretch being that bandits can use it(though visually it appears they can't actually repair it properly, as most bandit suits are just metal plates haphazardly welded onto a powered exoskeleton.

This means that you have to find a holotape before you get a drink of water from the sink, and a second upgrade holotape before the sink will let you <em>fill bottles with water to take on your journey</em>.
<ul><li> Also, the automated sink is literally the only water source in the <em>entire game</em> where you can refill your bottles.
</li><li> Cooking and crafting take on this aspect as well. It would make sense that a higher skill would represent know-how and experience to make a complicated weapon, explosive, ammo type, drug or meal. It just gets ridiculous that you'd need a fairly high Survival skill level of 50 just to know how cook a fucking Bighorner steak, despite the fact that other types of steaks are available at lower levels.
</li><li> There are martial arts techniques that can only be unlocked by being trained by martial artists scattered across the Mojave. The Khan Trick is one such technique, and allows you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHandfulForAnEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHandfulForAnEye">pick a handful of sand off the floor and blind your opponent with it</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> brings back grenades and lets any class use any weapon effectively in both single-player and co-op, leading to players' joy at their CQC Infiltrator, Sniper Adept, or anything else they cared to use.
</li><li> The first game allowed the player to switch out their armor and that of their squad. In <em>ME2</em>, the only way to do change the squad's was by gaining loyalty or DLC. Same in <em>ME3</em>, but without loyalty. While armour changes in <em>ME2</em> are palette swaps only and don't affect gameplay, in <em>ME3</em> each armour swap has a different passive effect.

</li><li> Try being an Adept. Right off the bat you can summon a black hole that lifts and disables every enemy in the area. But lifting a single target requires training. Several other classes can get the single target version but the black hole is Adept only.
</li><li> Throwing grenades and switching to different kinds of ammo is an unlockable ability in <em>ME2</em>, even though you can figure that out on your own in both the original and the third game.

Your character goes through basic military training if he joins the Navy or Marines, which only makes you capable of using a pistol. A Marine spending a whole <em>year</em> in weapons training will let him use a shotgun as well. An assault rifle requires a skill level of 6, and thus it is impossible for even a guy who spent 3 years in the Marines to start with the ability to use.
<ul><li> The crystal shard is an even more blatant example. You need high research skill AND a rank of exotic weapons in order to use it as a glorified club.

The Scout, Sniper, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">Engineer</a> without their default hats.

</li><li> Seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">Pyroland</a> requires everyone to have certain items, including the Pyro — when this is supposed to be what he sees <em>all the time.</em> This is understandable, as only being able to play Pyro with Pyroland visible would be quite annoying.
</li><li> Parodied with the high-five taunt <a class="urllink" href="http://www.teamfortress.com/manniversary/highfive.html">which includes a page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where Saxton Hale claims high-fiving someone is his invention, is complicated enough that you need to pay him to learn how, and before people could only congratulate each other through punches to the face.

</li><li> One of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> examples is the Medicine power pool. The animations for each power in the pool involve pulling out this little green device, aiming it at a target, and pushing a button that makes this green laser and mist spray out. The first two powers in each pool are available at level 6, the third power is available at level 14. The first two powers of the Medicine pool target allies, and the third targets yourself. So if you take one of the powers at level 6, <em>it takes 8 levels for your character to be able to go from pointing the device at allies to pointing the device at him/herself.</em>

<ul><li> Made even more egregious by the fact that a monk can hold a weapon in each hand at level 1, but a warrior, who is trained in the art of weapons of war, must wait until level 13 before they can even <em>attempt</em> to wield two weapons.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> starts you out with the ability to equip helmets/hats, pants, weapons, and shields (or other items you want to carry around in your off-hand, which can be anything from spellbooks to stuffed animals). If you want to wear a shirt, you need to learn Torso Awaregness (sic). It's taught by a gnome in a secret area only available <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">after ascending</a>. If you learn it in Bad Moon, the gnome who teaches you it is kinda baffled that you don't know about your torso. Without that skill, not only are you unable to figure out how to use shirts, defeated monsters won't even drop shirts. Certain foods and drinks have level requirements as well. Also, just about all gear has some sort of stat requirement, from headgear to accessories.
<ul><li> It took a kingdom-wide effort of back-breaking labor of quenching a massive brushfire, 9 years after the game was released, for adventurers to realize that they do indeed have backs and that you can wear equipment over it.
</li><li> Special skills are required to make certain foods and drinks. Most are believable, but it's a little weird that you need Advanced Cocktailcrafting and a high-tech still to stick a paper umbrella in a drink.
</li><li> A skill revamp added specialized training in the arts of smirking, arched eyebrows, and many other facial expressions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaTale">La Tale</a></em> has books which, when read, can teach your character to use a particular emote. These emotes include the ability to point at things, the ability to stick your hand out without pointing at things, and the ability <em>to be sad</em>. To make it worse, these books tend to have a low chance of even working, so most of the time, your character will be completely unable to comprehend how to look angry or whatever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi">Mabinogi</a></em> has the "Rest" skill, which has to be learned. That's right, the game <em>doesn't even give you the ability to sit down</em> until an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a> teaches you how (to get higher ranks in the skill, you have to learn from NPCs or books). Fortunately, it's one of the first skills that player characters learn.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, both Jedi Knights and Jedi Consulars assemble their first lightsabers in a cutscene. However you will be unable to make <em>more</em> lightsabers unless you take artifice as a crafting skill, get it to the required level and obtain a relevant schematic.
<ul><li> For Free-To-Play players, they must get to level 10 in order to sprint and level 25 in order to use speeders.
</li></ul></li><li> When starting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em> every character first has to level in the novice class. This is partially because the novice classes skills include fundamental abilities, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=55">like sitting down.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, your character can, starting out, use bronze and iron armor and weapons, but it's not until higher levels of Defense or Attack that he can wear steel or any other weapons. The same goes for mining rocks — you can't mine, say, mithril at starting level, but you can mine copper and tin, even though the ore is right there <em>either way</em>.
<ul><li> Then, there is waiting <strong>ten</strong> levels to learn how to <em>add a basic chocolate bar to a simple, already cooked cake</em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2j8wf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2j8wf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2j8wf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A standard Cake can be made with a Level 40 Cooking skill, while the requirement to make a Chocolate Cake is Level <em>50</em> Cooking.</span> That's just the tip of the iceberg. The player character has to get an an absurdly high 68 Cooking just to know how to <em>add tuna to a baked potato.</em>

And its only available for the Tactical class.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, it is possible to have a character that is too low level to drink a glass of milk. No, the milk isn't magical or from some exotic animal or anything. Just a regular glass of milk. This is just one food example of many.
<ul><li> You can drink plain old water from the start, but <em>fancy water from an oasis in Uldum</em> has to wait until you're a level 80 adventurer who's seen every part of the world and fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> for a living. Too much fizzy power for you to handle.
<ul><li> Weirdly averted with most alcoholic items; there are plenty of "extremely potent" boozes that you can guzzle down immediately at level 1 and get hella smashed from — which only makes the milk and water examples above all the more ridiculous.
</li></ul></li><li> While most of the professions have some form of logic to their research, Herbalism has you capable of identifying <em>all</em> plants as soon as you get Apprentice, and spotting them from thirty paces, but before <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, you couldn't PICK them, even though you could pick others. This became more reasonable after the revamp so that trying to pick plants you're unfamiliar with results in unusable bits of destroyed herb.
</li><li> You also need to be level 20 as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">worgen</a> to learn how to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningOnAllFours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningOnAllFours">run on four legs</a></em>. On the bright side, you also automatically learn how to ride mounts at the same time.
</li><li> Rogues require level 26 to sprint. To every other class, the very concept of running as hard as you can is completely alien.
</li><li> Characters can equip hats, pauldrons and jewellery from the start, but with the exception of some vanity items, you're unlikely to find any you can wear until about level 20-25.
</li><li> This trope is parodied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman">Griftah the Troll salesman</a> who sells costly amulets that "grant" you abilities such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism">eating food to heal wounds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympicSwimmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympicSwimmer">great swimming skills</a>. All of these are "abilities" characters in the game have to begin with.
</li><li> Hunters and Warlocks now don't know how to give their pets commands until a certain level. While this helps with learning the class, it can also be rather annoying when you can't tell your pet to stop attacking.
</li><li> Even portals sometimes come with a level restriction, such as the <em>Dark Portal</em> leading to Outland. On the other hand, nothing is stopping you from getting a mage to open you a portal to Pandaria at any level.
</li><li> A now-gone webcomic had a troll (in-game, not internet) mocking the idea that he was too low level to eat a loaf of bread. A mighty struggle ensued, and he...exploded. The bread flashed, and one of the other people in the party asked "Did...did the bread just <em>level</em>?"
</li><li> Before <em>Cataclysm</em> removed them, weapon skills were this. They were slowly leveled by fighting with the weapon in question (reasonable), but if you never equipped a specific type of weapon before, you had to go to town and pay a trainer NPC to unlock the ability to even <em>equip</em> this kind of weapon, at which point you could begin the long and time-consuming process of actually training yourself to fight with this weapon. So a level 80 paladin who was one of the world's most proficient combatants with a mace still had to take courses in... holding a sword without dropping it, apparently.

In the expansion, you can research/"purchase" shoes to enhance their speed, for which they thank you and stop complaining. This basic thing requires a black market (high-tier research facility) too.
<ul><li> Also, your basic soldiers are equipped with assault rifles like everyone else. Angry Mobs only possess pistols from the start, but can gain assault rifles later, which <em>also</em> requires the involvement of black market. Don't even ask why these mobs can only be recruited late into the game when you get RPG users at the start, or why no-one else can get access to their petrol bombs.
</li><li> You need to get an upgrade at your barracks to give your soldiers the ability to capture buildings. The only component of capturing buildings we see is your soldiers kneeling in front of whatever building they're capturing while holding your flag. What's so complicated about that?

Tarkus (Tactical Marine) and Thaddeus (Assault Marine) need a trait to be able to equip Chainswords and Bolters respectively (in canon and preceding games, every Space Marine knows that). They also cannot use heavy weapons at all, even though all space marines start their service as heavy weapon specialists. It is even more bizarre for their captain, who can freely equip jump packs, but needs a trait for heavy weapons. Not only that, Cyrus is supposedly a master scout and infiltration specialist, but he starts at level 1 and has to be taught how to drop smoke bombs, using a shotgun, etc.

The only unit that doesn't have to learn it is the Lurker, probably because if they can't burrow, they can't attack; on the other hand, they are also the only unit that can burrow but takes a substantial amount of time to do so (there is some variation in the others, according to unit size, but nothing so marked).
<ul><li> Zerg Queens have an upgrade called "Gamete Meiosis" - if taken at face value, that means they have to research the ability to produce reproductive sex cells. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note45a3k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note45a3k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note45a3k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The ability upgrades queens' energy and spellcasting ability.</span> Although, since the Zerg reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis (which one of their <em>buildings</em> does), this is actually quite the mutation.

Despite the fact that your infantry come from <em>cloning vats</em>, you have to spend time and money researching vehicle designs other than a jeep and weapons other then the most basic of machine guns.
</li><li> The Ghouls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> 3</em> need to spend time and money upgrading to allow them to eat the recent dead. Gargoyles apparently need to be taught how to stop flying. Abominations, walking piles of rotting corpses, need research to <strong>stink</strong>. The same upgrades also gives Meat Wagons (catapults that launch corpses) the same ability on their projectiles. It's almost as if the undead need to research <em>how to decompose.</em>
<ul><li> It does make sense that the undead can no longer digest food and need to be outfitted with a metabolism. And while it stands to reason that they would stink naturally, we're talking about a bio-weapon-grade stench that chokes the life out of people, while not impacting the consitution of the creatures themselves - that too might require some tinkering. And the gargoyles don't just stop flying - they turn to stone and in that form they rapidly regenerate health.
</li><li> The night elves feature this with the entire faction researching night vision, for a group that is mostly active at night for biological reasons. Chimeras have to research using their other head to spit acid. Mountain Giants need research to make their skin, which is stone, resistant to normal attacks.
</li><li> Trolls need to be taught how to regenerate, which is an innate ability to all members of their race (<em>Years</em> later it was explained that troll regeneration is tied to that individual troll's connection to a mystical loa that grants them their regenerative abilities. So researching regeneration apparently means instituting some kind of compulsory religious seminar). Orcish grunts and raiders need research to know how to pillage while Tauren need to learn how to smash the ground with their totems.
</li><li> Footmen, who have a large shield from the beginning, need to be trained to put their shield in front of their face. Also, notably, the first weapon upgrade for the Footmen, who use iron swords from the beginning, is <em>iron forged swords</em>, as if until then they had been using bamboo weapons.
</li><li> The apex upgrade for Druids of the Claw is learning how to <em>roar as a bear</em>. It's not that they have to research how to roar (they actually start with that as their first ability) — they need to learn how to do it while not in night elf form.
</li><li> Apparently the Tauren Chieftains needs to master their ultimate skill in order to stomp on the ground. By far the most bizarre however, has to be the Blademaster. One of the Blademaster's basic abilities that he can learn from level 1 is a full-on magic spell called Mirror Image. His ultimate that he has to wait 6 levels for? Whirlwind, aka "Holding your sword out and spinning in a circle". Magic? Easy for any warrior. Twirling? Only the elitist of the elite can twirl.
</li><li> A very late patch (as in, the last one before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>) sort-of fixed one problem- Tauren now automatically have Pulverize, the research instead improves the ability. But that same patch also shifted the Necromancer's spells so what was once their ultimate ability (Cripple, a debilitating single-target debuff) is now their first ability, and their iconic Raise Dead ability (which turns any corpse into a pair of skeletons) now needs one level of research.
</li></ul></li><li> None of the alien weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em> can be used before they are reverse-engineered by a team of scientists in your home base. The aliens are largely unintelligent, and most of the weapons look exactly like human guns. Even more absurdly, you also have to research the alien ammunition magazines separately from the weapons before you can use them.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOAfterblank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UFOAfterblank">UFO Afterblank</a></em> provides two solid justifications: the aliens are far more alien (and intelligent), and when their weapons are researched, it's not just a matter of finding out how to use them, but also learning the basic principles that the weapons work on so that they can be reverse-engineered, and also so that they don't potentially explode in the face of your soldiers (like in, say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a></em> with the little red button).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirVasilyev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirVasilyev">Vladimir Vasilyev</a>'s novelization, alien weapons are biometrically-locked, meaning a soldier can pick up what looks like a gun but can't fire it. Scientists first have to figure out how to enter the soldier's DNA into the gun's database. Doesn't explain why different weapons would have different security measures.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">2012 reboot</a>, not only are the alien guns biometrically locked, but they also <em>explode</em> if the alien carrying it dies, to avoid them being reverse-engineered. In order to steal alien guns, not only do you need to research them but also capture the aliens alive — but you can't put on new equipment in the field anyway. The technical readouts after doing such research also indicate that the humans aren't just using standard alien weapons; they have to be adjusted to fit human hands, and in some cases it takes a great deal of research to find ways to lighten the weapon enough for a human to even handle it.
<ul><li> The reboot requires research into alien Weapon Fragments before the engineers can build and distribute weapon scopes for their rifles. Admittedly, the S.C.O.P.E. is built from alien parts to create some sort of "advanced targeting system", so presumably it isn't just a standard telescopic sight.
</li><li> The reboot also requires you to learn a specific skill in order for Heavies and Supports to lay down suppressive fire, something that real-world soldiers learn in basic training.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBureauXCOMDeclassified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBureauXCOMDeclassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a></em>, Outsider weapons disintegrate along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades">alien bodies</a> upon death. However, as soon as you manage to obtain an alien weapon that hasn't yet been activated, all the weapons of the same type carried by aliens suddenly stop disintegrating.
</li></ul></li><li> A common feature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em> and its various expansions and sequels. Notably, the ability for American infantry to build sandbags must be unlocked by a specific commander (while their engineers otherwise are apparently always able to carry bags and shovels), while for certain units the ability to sprint requires veteran status.
</li><li> If you play as the Empire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a></em>, you will need to spend a skill point just to give your lords a horse to ride into battle with. This applies to all lords, including the faction leader. You would think horses would be standard issue for army field commanders, especially since they are in all the other Total War games.

Seems like, in the Thirties, nobody thought yet about outfitting with wool uniforms troops deployed in cold places. Even cold countries (Canada, USA, USSR, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Nepal...) must manually research this tech at the game's start. There's also a Desert &amp; Jungle Clothing tech (cotton clothes for hot areas), which is somehow not available at start by countries living in those climates.
<ul><li> There are also nations which don't start off with Artillery, a type of weapon which has been in use since the 1400's, with breech loading rifled guns since the 1840s, finally to what was considered the first 'modern' artillery piece, the French 75 built in 1897.

What is the Dybbuk-Seizer, you may ask? It's a Dybbuk plane (of which Epsilon has many buildable versions that don't require infiltration) with three Epsilon Adepts/Elites (which can be trained without infiltrating any building) on it.

</div><ul><li> Even more ridiculous with gambits: apparently, unless you find a card that tells character to, say, target an ally with a specific status ailment they are unable to figure out that it's possible to do so. Straining the limits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a> is the least that can be said about this.
</li><li> Not quite as bad but in the same neighborhood: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, you have to learn how to use each item individually through the (Al)Chemist class.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, Sazh, Vanille, and Hope apparently forget how to do <em>basic attacks</em> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they become l'Cie</span>, and of the three only Sazh gets the ability back automatically. Especially silly as they're all capable of using basic attacks <em>before</em> that point, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vanille was already a l'Cie before then anyway.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>, you need to spend feats in order to equip weapons and armor your class isn't proficient with. Not use, equip. That's right, unless you train for this specific purpose, a wizard (generally considered to be very smart people) lacks the understanding to hold a sword without immediately dropping it. (In the pen &amp; paper game you only take penalties for non-proficiency.) This is a problem in one of the expansions, where the ui only lets you upgrade weapons you personally have equipped...and you're expected to provide gear for your companions.
</li><li> Ditto <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>, where everything including <em>rings and necklaces</em> have stat and level requirements to wear them. Also, your characters are apparently so paranoid about magical items that they refuse to wield anything until it's been identified. And while in <em>Diablo</em>, you could wear Unidentified items, but bear the risk of it being cursed, in the sequel you can <em>not</em> wear Unidentified items and there are <em>no</em> Cursed items.
<div class="indent"> "Alas, poor adventurer - he accidentally put on the Necklace of Self-Decapitation."
</div><ul><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, your druid may know how to summon a cluster of three tornadoes, but summoning one tornado is beyond his grasp until six levels later. This could be explained away as him not being capable of focusing/containing his power into one strong attack.
</li><li> Your mage in <em>Diablo</em> starts out with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">level two Firebolt</a> and is incapable of casting Holy Bolt, which according to the lore was explicitly created to be easy to cast for anyone with no particular magical talent. It gets worse in the sequel, where the sorceress and necromancer start the game with zero magical or necromantic abilities whatsoever and rely on their staff or wand to cast anything at all.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats">VG Cats</a></em> parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=240">used as the page image<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is not that far from the truth. Some Pokémon don't learn an attack move until double-digit levels (for the uninitiated, sample low-level attacks include "Tackle" and "Peck"), Poochyena's species' is "Bite" but it doesn't learn how to bite until <em>level thirteen</em>, and even more mind-boggling, Pidgey - a pigeon - <em>never</em> learns to Peck, and neither do several other evolutionary lines of bird Pokémon.
<ul><li> Drowzee, a Pokémon with a diet made up of dreams, can only learn Dream Eater by TM. And Gastly can't learn Poison Gas attack despite <em>being</em> poison gas that suffocates victims with its body.
</li><li> Lickitung couldn't learn, you know, <strong>Lick</strong> until Gen II.
</li><li> The overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining">Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training</a> makes this even more awkward—a Mon can only remember 4 skills at a time, and often has only one opportunity to learn a particular skill. If your Lickitung has mastered licking, you may decide to permanently erase his ability to lick things so he can learn to stomp on things.
</li><li> Even more offending is the HM moves. A Pokémon needs to be taught a special move, and a badge that somehow allows them to use it, to have a super powerful creature <em>punch a rock</em>.
<ul><li> Almost no Pokémon can learn Fly naturally, despite "Flying" being a very common element, and there are nine Pokemon that can't learn it even by HM <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6n1ts');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6n1ts" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6n1ts');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">these are Gyarados, Mantyke, Mantine, Gligar, Gliscor, Hoppip, Skiploom, Jumpluff, and Shaymin when it is in "Sky Forme"</span> even though their types include "<em>Flying</em>".
</li><li> The same applies to Surf, especially when <em>you actually catch some of them while they are swimming</em>. And just to round out the HMs, Cut. In Gen I, you can start the game with a creature whose tail is <em>literally</em> on fire or one that's basically a living plant itself, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">you're stymied by a single small tree</a>. Even later when you have hundreds of vastly powerful creatures at your command, if none of them know Cut, you're going to be sitting there behind a small tree forever. A tree that, unlike a giant rock or a vast ocean, could easily be overcome with a sturdy pair of garden shears.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> in some instances in regards to HM usage outside of battle as some of these Pokémon are 1. too small to carry their Trainers and soar the skies or traverse bodies of water; and 2. for flying types, they are described in the Pokédex as simply gliding, but most of the time, it follows this trope. In some bizarre cases, however, even some Pokémon (such as Pidgey, a small Flying-type, and Doduo, a Flying-type without wings) who should be incapable of learing HM moves are able to learn use them.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> And in most games the player character is apparently incapable of running without special shoes. Maybe they are wearing sandals. Or are extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a> and assume that the existence of "running shoes" means that one is not allowed to run in any other kind of shoes.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a></em> games have quite a few examples of this trope. Each character has certain IQ skills, which can be turned on and off in the menu screen and more can be gained by eating Gummies, and some only affect the partner Pokémon behaviors because they're what any human in their right mind would know what to do. While the game is at least smart enough to have some skills automatically available at the beginning (like not using a ranged attack if a wall is in the way), some IQ skills which seem essential for survival must be unlocked, like the ability to not use an attack which poisons when the foe is already poisoned, attacking the foe who is weak to your element first, and avoiding stepping on traps which are sitting out in the open. When later games got rid of IQ skills, they made the more common sense ones a part of the default AI.
</li><li> Some Pokémon can learn the Bite and Crunch moves through breeding. In other words, some Pokémon have to <em>inherit</em> the ability to bite things with sharp teeth. And not a single 'mon in the Gible evolutionary line can learn Bite despite them all having mouths full of sharp teeth, not even Ga<strong>bite</strong> (at least Garchomp gets Crunch).
</li><li> Growlithe never learns the move Growl, even though, like the above case, <strong>it's in its name</strong>. But it does learn Roar. So, it can make a loud noise with its mouth, but not a quieter one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em> has a number of purchaseable clothing items for your player character. One of these items is <em>poses</em>. You have to spend in-game currency to adjust your body to a different position.

Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Raine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Sage</a> needs at least one star to learn that a sandwich consists of more than a slice of bread.
<ul><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, characters need to be at least level five and equip one passive skill for them to be able to run freely in battle; until then, you can only go back and forward.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, our two heroes can't walk backwards or sideways until they learn a technique from Merri. Then they can only do so if Luigi uses his Thunderhand to shock Mario. This overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready">You Shouldn't Know This Already</a>, because it is not enough to learn the Thunderhand: the heroes must meet Gigi and Merri before they can start walking backwards or sideways.
<ul><li> Notably, you CAN use the actions themselves before meeting Gigi and Merri, but it doesn't work; using the Thunderhand example before you properly learn to do it just results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessElectrocution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessElectrocution">Harmless Electrocution</a> and a pissed-off Mario.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>, all your interpersonal interactions had to be learned by reading a book. This meant that it would take your character many in-game years before they learned how to do such things as fart, belch, or flip someone off due to not having found the correct book to teach you how. You also had to level up your gun skill several times before you could learn how to actually aim it.
</li><li> Oliver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni">Ni no Kuni</a></em> apparently went through his childhood without knowing how to jump, and is only able to master it in-game by spending one of his stamp-cards at Swift Solutions.
</li><li> Punching things until you acquire a weapon is a standard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinkSmallwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinkSmallwood">Dink Smallwood</a></em> move. In the mod <em>Legend of the Duck</em> Dink <em>didn't know how to punch</em> until he asked a wishing well for a weapon and was told "Use your fists, dummy!"
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Risen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Risen">Risen</a></em> game, you need training and experience points just to learn how to kick people.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, you need a specific high-level perk in the Destruction tree in order for enemies to have a chance of panicking if you set them on fire. Otherwise they just stand there swinging their sword at you completely unfazed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, you begin with the ability to summon a giant hand to push things around. Later, you equip various items that let you: summon a giant hand to grab things from far away, summon a giant hand to dig up a handful of dirt, summon a giant hand to form into a fist and hammer things into the ground, summon a giant hand to form into a fist and hammer things from the side, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">summon two giant hands to lift things up in the air</a>. There's an entire *school* of giant-hand-based magic, and no explanation as to why one simple "Summon Giant Hand" spell couldn't cover all of these purposes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AttackTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AttackTheLight">Attack The Light</a></em>, some of the abilities you only unlock later on are ones that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">the show</a> has established that they'd known for thousands of years. Sometimes it can be justified as representing Steven being able to <em>convince</em> them to do something they wouldn't normally do (like Fusion or retreating from battle) because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>.
</li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline">Girls Frontline</a></em> already have some variety of attachments on their weapons, like sights and suppressors, but unless they're used as part of the girl's skill, these attachments confer no benefits until you actually produce the equipment in question. This is particularly noticeable with exclusive gear, which tend to take the form of attachments that are unique to a gun, like the G36's carry handle with an integrated scope and red dot sight... but the girls in question also tend to already have those attachments on their guns in their artwork, yet still require you to extensively grind out night stages to acquire unique and exclusive pieces of gear that they <em>already have</em>. Exclusive equipment acquired by upgrading them to MOD 3 also fits to a lesser extent, since you do get the equipment just for that, but their art tends to depict them as always having it even though it's optional, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">a longer barrel on SAA's revolver</a>. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">crossover</a> events do the same, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VA11HALLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VA11HALLA">VA-11 HALL-A</a></em> event, where the unique equipment options you can acquire for the girls include the armor Sei is already wearing and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">various prostheses</a> Dana, Alma and Stella are already using.

</li><li> <em>Brotherhood</em> and <em>Revelations</em> did this much better: Ezio is already a skilled Assassin and a very quick learner, so instead of learning new techniques, he adapts his already-learned skills to new equipment he gets, like the poison dart (gun + poison blade), hookblade (hidden blade + hook), and crossbow (gun + arrow). He needs very little instruction, and soon begins teaching <em>others</em> in their use as the expert.

Never mind the fact that absolutely identical weapons of a lower level can be used without any problem and that two identical pieces of two-by-four can do drastically different amounts of damage depending on the level.
</li><li> This also makes leveling up mostly pointless, since it only makes the enemies harder and forces you to discard old weapons that suddenly become unable to kill anything.
</li><li> The ability to simply stomp on zombies that are lying prone on the ground has to be learned, and cannot be learned until a fairly high level. Until then, if you want to kill prone zombies without degrading your weapons, you have to just kick them repeatedly, sometimes dozens of times.

This can lead to some silliness, as there's nothing stopping you from making games <em>named</em> something along the lines of "Kill Butt" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Videogamedunkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Videogamedunkey">"Kill Butt 2"</a>, that are in the same genre and use the same theme, but are not considered sequels. Additionally, you have to research different settings for games that can often seem like this, such as researching how to create a game set in space or a fantasy world (an option that may not even be available for some time).

The type of meals you can make goes up with your Cooking skill. That's the part that makes sense. The part that doesn't make sense is that your chance of starting a kitchen fire also <em>decreases</em> with your Cooking skill, and seems to have little relation to how simple your task actually is. So you need Cooking skill to avoid bungling things that real people with no cooking ability manage to do without starting fires, like <em>toast a Pop-Tart</em>.

Thermometers are pretty high up on the tree, while flat pieces of metal and octagonal scaffolding are apparently more advanced than nuclear rocket engines. You can unlock new technology by performing science experiences, such as by discovering that water is wet (though many player read a great deal of sarcasm in the low-return science replies).

The funny thing is that, while you may be able to build giant hanging roller coasters from the very start, you might be researching simple food stalls or gentle rides (such as spiral slides) along the way.
<ul><li> Even more ridiculous is that, in the third game, you can choose to have individual scenery items, as simple as a <em>wooden fence</em>, researched.

If they already have an emotional catchphrase of one type and the RNG lands on it, they'll ask the player if they should keep the catch phrase, which is redundant as the player can edit a catchphrase at any time once they give one to a particular Mii (unless they're playing the Japan-only <em>Tomodachi Collection</em>, which only allows players to quick-edit the main catchphrase of a Mii), and thus giving the emotional catchphrase re-ask a purpose.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em>, it takes a workshop, a large supply of lumber, and a dedicated professional to prepare the schematics for... a wheat field, which then needs to be constructed. You Have Engineered Farming! The sequel does away with this by letting you just designate any fertile area for planting.
</li><li> Your <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RimWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RimWorld">RimWorld</a></em> colony can start at one of two tech levels. If you choose the higher one, you start with a few techs pre-learned that are a few branches up the tech tree, naturally. However, more primitive techs are locked, and actually more difficult for you to "re-learn". So for example, you may know how to harness the powers of electricity, but you'll have to do some research if you want to brew beer. The justification is that these colonies are usually considered to be stranded survivors from some more advanced civilization where most people didn't <em>need</em> to know those sorts of things.

For certain weapons (like the Red 9 or Bolt-Action Rifle in <em>4</em>) this might make sense since these guns have somewhat complex reload mechanics but for others like your standard pistol or the Semi-Auto Rifle, all this amounts to is your character being able to slip a magazine into the gun a bit more hastily.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> games require you to "research" various political and religious concepts, such as polytheism and monarchy. Civilization 5 (and 4, to a lesser extent) made a point of stripping most of these out and putting them under a different mechanic entirely, but even then, technology limits what civics/policies you can implement at any one time.
<ul><li> This phenomenon was probably at its worst in Civ 4, where even certain <em>diplomatic options</em> were locked behind specific technologies (and yet you can see the game map before you discover Map-making, you know what year it is before you research Calendar, and your per-turn income and expenses are quantified in gold pieces before you invent Currency).
<ul><li> Cities can be built right away but Agriculture must be researched, despite the fact that in the real world, agriculture is what led to the development of permanent settlements. In Civ V, every civilization starts with Agriculture already researched.
</li></ul></li><li> Other weirdness is being able to build units that can do the same thing, but require different techs. For example in Civ 5, you can build chariot archers without researching archery, and your cities attack enemies in the ancient era with arrows by default, but you can't build normal foot archers until you have archery.
<ul><li> As if that wasn't egregious enough, it is possible to invent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">gatling guns</a> without researching <em>gunpowder</em>. The Brave New World expansion lets you invent the Internet without researching <em>computers</em>, or nine of the prerequisites leading up to it (going back to chemistry in the Renaissance era).
</li><li> In a lesser example, you can also invent the Radio without half of the Renaissance techs and almost the entire Industrial Era. This becomes more extreme if you use it to get an ideology sooner than you should and use Democracy to get free Foreign Legion units... which have guns, despite not having researched Steel, Gunpowder, and Chemistry.
</li><li> Civilization IV had multiple prerequisites for certain units: you wouldn't be able to build horse archers until you had discovered both horseback riding and archery. However, you could still build helicopter gunships without discovering gunpowder.
</li></ul></li><li> A popular mod for Civilization 4, <em>Caveman 2 Cosmos</em>, adds a primitive era. You have to research language, the ability to gather berries, and persistence hunting.

In several of these cases, the information is shown, but it is up to the player to organise and remember it.
<ul><li> You must also research the ability for your military forces to remember and report to you what technologies they have seen other races use in battle, and the ship types. However, as soon as you research the tech, it turns out to be already full of the stuff you've seen by that point, which means they <em>have</em> been recording the data but just didn't feel the need to let their commanding officer's know.
</li><li> Probably the two most egregious examples are two techs in the command and control section of the tech tree. One just gives you the ability to look at sensor data and give orders at the same time. Its prerequisite is a tech that makes your ships send their sensor data to command vessels. Essentially, you have researched captains actually telling the ship in command what they see, and can now research the ability to multitask (or put buttons on the sensor display.)
</li></ul></li><li> In most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games, any unit will attack twice if its attack speed exceeds the opponent's by four points.

They brought back a few one-of-a-kind pieces of very nice advanced technology... but most of the engineering and production techniques they are used to depend on infrastructure that doesn't yet exist in this time, and would be impossible to build for millenia. So while they get a big head start on production at the beginning, they have to start at <em>the very bottom</em> of the tech tree to rediscover basic engineering principles, while other races often have a number of very early techs pre-researched.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, the Master Chief is incapable of sprinting, although he is already jogging at 18 km/h regardless. Then, in the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, the player (another type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartan</a>) gains sprinting as a pickup, next to the jetpack ability and active camo device. This is due to the armour not being synched sufficiently well with the wearer to run safely without breaking one's bones, which is fixed by the pick-up. From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> onward, the Chief can sprint whenever he wants, since Cortana "rewrote the [suit's] firmware".
</li><li> The ability to dual-wield was introduced in <em>Halo 2</em>, and provided some balancing issues. It was explained, again, as updated software. It appeared in <em>Halo 3</em>, but was removed for <em>Reach</em> (a prequel), and quietly left out of the mainline games from <em>Halo 4</em> onward.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoodleGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoodleGod">Doodle God</a></em> games use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion">Combinatorial Explosion</a> as the core mechanic: you start out with the basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) and combine them to create things, then you combine those things to create other things, ad nauseum. The combination trees can lead to quite a bit of silliness, such as developing nuclear weapons before figuring out how to <em>bake bread</em>.
</li><li> For whatever reason your character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em> cannot carry more than two weapons at the start of the game until they hit arbitrary moments when they realize they can hold another gun. There's not even a valid reason as to why, just suddenly you can do it as if they forgot how their holsters worked until that exact moment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloonsTowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloonsTowerDefense">Bloons Tower Defense</a></em>, one of the Alchemist's upgrades is Acid Pool AKA throwing the acid flask on the ground. Making it egregious, it's one of the more expensive upgrades among tier 1 upgrades. Apparently it's easier for the Alchemist to learn how to make stronger acid than to just throw it on the floor.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> side game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleSpellCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleSpellCard">Impossible Spell Card</a></em>, the plot is Seija using various cheat items to dodge near impossible attacks from other <em>Touhou</em> characters. In the beginning she can only use one item per stage. It took her halfway through the game and Mamizou's advice for her to figure out that she can just use both of her hands to hold two items at once.

<ul><li> Also in 4th edition, Rogues make a return to mastering very specialized weapon types instead of 3rd edition's "sneak attack with anything" paradigm. As a result, Rogues only start with proficiency in weapons they can sneak attack with, which doesn't include some of the simplest weapons in the game like a club or quarterstaff, which even the martially inept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> types get access to. Nor does the default rogue get the option to use a shortbow or do much at range in general, which had become a staple of the class in the previous edition. Later books contained options for the class that offered these styles of play, but only by giving up other class features in exchange.
</li><li> The biggest cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> in <em>D&amp;D 3</em> is this trope applying to weapon feats, which essentially teach the warrior some new minor skill, while spellcasters keep receiving ever-growing reality-altering magical powers just for leveling up and use <em>their</em> feats to make those spells <em>even better</em>.
<ul><li> One of 3.5's most absurd feats was Research, which "expands the way you can use the Knowledge skills" to give you the ability to use a library. Note that most D&amp;D 3.x characters are automatically literate.
</li></ul></li><li> While those who remember their ancient history will recall 2nd edition <em>D&amp;D</em> where the separation of rules governing various class abilities lead to some significant logical flaws (not to mention the lack of flexibility and additional complexity). For example climbing was a thief skill. Therefore the implication was that the only way your character could have any chance at all of climbing anything harder than a ladder was to be a thief. Of course being a tabletop game your DM could work around that but it was still fortunate that they fixed it in 3rd edition with the introduction of a universal skill system that all classes have access to.
</li><li> Those first few editions also feature Weapon Proficiencies as slots which players spent to learn specific weapons. This meant a character could train and learn how to use weapons with mechanically identical functions, but because they have different names, the character can't (rules as written) use them correctly. For example, mace and club were different proficiencies. So were dagger, dirk, and knife. According to the Core Rules, you could be a fearsome master of the long sword and the two-handed sword, but none of that would translate to a faint clue about how the claymore or broad sword might be wielded.
<ul><li> A particularly silly example happened to any character who dual classed. The dual class character had to forgo everything they knew from their old class aside from their Hit Points until they exceeded their level in their original class with their level in the new class. Then everything came back at once. In theory, a character could become a legendary 18th level Paladin, dual class to cleric and then lose all their hard-won combat training, and have to fight as a first level cleric and use none of his Paladin powers. Once he becomes a 19th level cleric, he goes right back to having all his Paladin abilities again. He could then dual class again, this time to wizard, which would cost him all his warrior skills -and- all his cleric spells until he became a 20th level Wizard, at which point he could once again sling spells as a 19th level Cleric and fight as an 18th level Paladin. You <em>could</em> use your old abilities before surpassing your old level, but it cost you nearly all the XP of encounters.
</li><li> Some editions take the stance that an adventuring class is an incredibly complex discipline and, in order to learn a different one, you have to set aside your previous training to adapt to a new paradigm. Using your old skills meant no XP simply because you basically failed at your new class, didn't learn anything, and fell back to your old way of thinking.
</li></ul></li><li> For many outsiders used to modern RPG video games, the fact that a powerful sorcerer able to cast a Polar Ray might not know the simple Ray of Frost that looks like a downgraded version of the same spell is absolutely baffling for the same reason to them as for many examples from he Civ series listed above. For players familiar with the spell system and how magic in general works in D20 RPGs, it all makes perfect sense.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL">FATAL</a></em> has a <em>Urination</em> skill.
<ul><li> Worse, the game's creator has bragged that most player characters will be killed before they ever max out the urination stat. In the FATAL universe, you actually <em>forget</em> how to pee as you get older and have to relearn it, <em>and most people never do</em>.
</li><li> It also has skills for Sitting, Spitting and <em>Tasting</em>.

</p><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfPrince">½ Prince</a></em> one of the earliest things that occurs is that the main character (a warrior with a sword) tries kicking and yelling at the mobs. Both turn out to be abilities that will level up with use. Later, a pet is hit with a stick and learns a pinball/chain lightning attack. The characters can also use any move at anytime and get some interesting effects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CavernsAndCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CavernsAndCreatures">Caverns And Creatures</a></em>, Cooper forgets how to read when he is transported into the titular tabletop game, all because he happened to have rolled a very low Intelligence score and chose to be a half-orc (which gives an additional -2 to his Intelligence score). Even after making it back to the real world, he's still a half-orc, so the game rules still apply. He can't even read the word "cat". The only exception is when he's reading character sheets, since those aren't really a part of the game world. At least, in the real world, signs for businesses and the like tend to have recognizable logos even without knowing how to read them. In the second book, he's trying to find a tavern that someone called "Horse Head". Naturally, he's looking for a drawing of a horse in lieu of being able to read the name. As it turns out, the name is actually "Whore's Head" (same pronunciation), and the drawing on the sign is that of a woman. Also, the way magic works in the game, any caster has to spend time each day re-learning his spells, all of which can be only used a limited number of times per day before he <em>forgets</em> them. The whole series is a jab at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>.
