<p>Sometimes people can miss the point of things, due to being dense, stubborn, or lacking context, but the story treats this as a serious thing. The consequences can vary though, from a misunderstanding, to a tragedy, or even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding">Happy Ending</a>.

This also could apply to when the mentor/Parent/Acquaintance leaves some sort of instructions or advice that is tragically misinterpreted.

<ul><li> In fact, it's not just that he would've thrown his children's lives away; he <strong>did</strong> throw his children's lives away. Lelouch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tries to get his parents to understand that it's not right for them to have done that and argue that he had no right to disagree just because the things they'd planned to reunite the dead with the living happened to turn out well, but they refused to understand how evil it was that they would've let their children die (without even knowing whether their plan would succeed or not), and, worse still, self-serving; and, then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Charles continues to blame God when he's been the one responsible for making the world as awful as it is</a> (Lelouch points out that, regardless of the innocent lives that would be lost for Britannia's benefit, even with his children in exile, he was still bent on conquering Japan, and, according to Suzaku in the episode prior, he could've saved Euphy)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, the New Captain Amagai Arc has a villain whose motivation is that Head Captain Yamamoto killed his father. The only other clue he had is that the father's dying words were "Bakkoto," the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> and Empathetic Weapons featured in the arc. It turns out that the father's last words were actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Beware the Bakkoto" and that Yamamoto killed him because he was possessed, making the entire arc a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Shoot the Shaggy Dog</a> Story as had he not sworn revenge, the original villain's schemes would have still outed him as a villain and Amagai (who committed suicide out of remorse after losing to Ichigo and learning the truth) would still be alive</span>.
<ul><li> In Uryu's introductory arc, he starts a "hollow hunting contest," between himself and Ichigo to see whether Soul Reapers or Quincies are superior, since he's bitter about the Soul Reapers abandoning his grandfather. Not only does this endanger many innocent people, but it also misses the point of what his grandfather was trying to accomplish- he wanted Soul Reapers and Quincies to <em>cooperate</em>. It's fairly telling that Ichigo gets the point the first time he's told the story, despite not having paid attention to it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, Arf tells Fate that seeing her sad and in pain from her quest for the Jewel Seeds is driving her insane with grief and begs her to stop. Fate's response is that she'll just have to repress her feelings to avoid upsetting Arf and try even harder to finish her mission. Fate eventually gets the point after her mother makes it clear that she never thought of Fate as her daughter, and regrets taking Arf's loyalty for granted and causing her pain by persisting in this painful and hopeless quest.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, Teana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">who's quite competent despite not having much magic power or many rare abilities</a> initially assumes that the only appropriate response to any mistake or inability to adequately contribute is to try even harder, which in turn leads to more problems. During the mission to protect the hotel, she and the other Forwards, who are essentially the last line of defense, don't see much action, so Teana tries to let loose with a magical barrage rather than hold out until Vita arrives, nearly injuring Subaru if not for Vita's intervention. After getting a harsh scolding from Vita and a calmer lecture from Nanoha, Teana pushes herself in training for several days, and tries a reckless combination attack against Nanoha during a training exercise, resulting in Nanoha blasting her into unconsciousness (which is implied to be partly the result of exhaustion). When Teana wakes up that night and is temporarily taken off active duty out of concern for her health, Teana protests and states her desire to be useful until Signum punches her in the face. After learning Nanoha's backstory and more of her training plans, Teana gets the point and decides to use what magic she has strategically.
</li></ul></li><li> This comes up in Teru Mikami's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. As a child, Teru did what he could to protect his schoolmates from bullies, and while he enjoyed some initial success, in high school, the bullies retaliated against him, prompting his mother to advise him to give up on his crusade. The narration points out that she did so out of concern for his well-being, but Teru decided that his mother had no sense of justice, and actually rejoiced when she was killed along with a few of the bullies in an auto accident.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Endeavor</a> believes that the only thing between him and the title of #1 Hero is that he isn't as strong as All Might, never thinking that it's related to the fact that he is an awful person who scares and is a huge jerk even to his own fans (later chapters reveal he has gathered a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> in-universe), while All Might is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> whose main interest is to make citizens feel safe and protected and inspires hope to the people. Endeavor becomes painfully aware of what he's lacking when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All Might is forced into retirement, and Endeavor becomes the #1 Hero by default, even though he can't be the Symbol of Peace that All Might had been. He's forced to clean up his act as a hero and a father, albeit with mixed results</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>
<ul><li> Many adults sing Touko's praises as being an ideal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> who takes after her late sister, not realizing that Touko was putting up a façade, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as was her sister</span>. In Chapter 10, after hearing one of the teachers say something to this effect, Yuu, one of the few who's aware of Touko's insecurities, makes a brief internal monologue noting how much the teacher missed the mark.
</li><li> While in middle school, Sayaka was once in a relationship with her senpai, only for the older girl to break off their relationship, thinking that they're getting too old for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a>, leading Sayaka to transfer out and go to Toomi East High School. In a side chapter, Sayaka's ex sees her again, and apologizes for making Sayaka interested in girls in the first place. Sayaka, who has come to terms with her sexuality and fallen in love with Touko, is deeply hurt by her ex's comments, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">after reassuring the older girl that she no longer loves her</a>, subtly expresses that she's still a lesbian by leaving arm-in-arm with Touko.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>
<ul><li> After learning that Nakai said that he'd only draw for Aoki if Aoki becomes Nakai's girlfriend, Fukuda confronts Nakai and punches him, angrily saying that he's forgotten his promise to compete with the other members of "Team Fukuda." Nakai, who's lost sight of his goals, angrily complains about Fukuda meddling in his love life.
</li><li> In the "PCP Copycat arc," someone imitates a "perfect crime" mentioned in PCP- breaking into a bank vault and leaving behind a note, thus causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> to come down even harder on the series. The point that both are missing is that while PCP are pranksters by nature, they only do "perfect crimes" that don't cause harm to others- when the crime was proposed in the manga itself, the characters decided against it, since someone breaking into the vault would cause the security company's reputation to suffer.
</li></ul></li><li> The New Fishman Pirates of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> idolize Fisher Tiger, a fishman adventurer who attacked Marijoa, center of the human-run World Government, believing it to be retribution for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> fishmen suffered, and practice anti-humanism to such a degree that they have no problem enslaving human pirates that sail towards Fishman Island. What they didn't seem to pick up on is that Tiger hated slavery in general, and attacked the city to free as many slaves as he could, regardless of race.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>: Much of the drama instigated by the antagonists in the story is due to them falling into this:
<ul><li> Both Erina Nakiri and her father Asami admire Joichiro Saiba as the ultimate chef, yet somehow they've made themselves a false image of him being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">a perfectionist who is obsessed with victory and does not admit failure</a>. This is specially jarring in Erina's case, as flashbacks show that Joichiro outright tells her that the chance of failure is part of the fun of crafting a new dish. In Azami's case, he wants "revenge" on the culinary world who caused Joichiro to hit burnout due to people constantly pressuring him and overlooking the hard work he put into his dishes, not realizing, one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">that he himself is acting the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">same</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">way as the people who ruined his idol</a>, and two, that Joichiro had long moved on and found happiness again in running a humble diner with his wife and son.
</li><li> In the final arc, Asahi Saiba, Joichiro's disciple and surrogate son of sorts, decided to take Joichiro's advice "the secret to becoming a great chef is meeting a woman that makes you want to give all the food you make to her." as meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">he has to marry the ultimate female gourmet, Erina, to cook for</a>.

The <em>entire point</em> of the Iron Throne (an extremely uncomfortable and <em>dangerous</em> chair made of swords) is that ruling a realm is a responsibility and a burden, not a prize in a game. So far as we know, only three people in the series really seem to have understood this: Eddard Stark, who had the opportunity to seize the Throne but refused it out of a sense of honor and never regretted it; Robert Baratheon, who never really wanted it in the first place but was forced to claim it; and Aegon the Conqueror, who made the damn thing in the first place. Stannis and Robb get some credit, as both of them dislike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">what comes with being King.</a> Both of them still aim for the throne, Robb in order to avenge his father and Stannis because it is his by right of inheritance and he's a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Principles Zealot</a>.

<ul><li> Although in Robb's case, he'd be quite happy to just keep the North &amp; the Trident an independent Kingdom from the rest of the South. His issue is a <em>different</em> way of interpreting this trope, as he is determined to accomplish one of two goals: take heavy reparations from the Southern Kingdom for the damages done to the Riverlands, the deaths of his own men in the conflict thus far, and for the death of his father and his sisters being captives in King's Landing (Arya escaped, but he doesn't know this); or dethrone the illegitimate Joffrey and eventually bring down the Lannisters in revenge and "justice", which if it ends with him claiming the entire Seven Kingdoms as a consequence is one that he (as his father's protege) is willing to pay. In the War Council at the end of the first book, his mother Catelyn <em>attempts to point out</em> the fact that killing the ones responsible for their dead will <em>not</em> bring her husband (or Lord Rickard Karstark's sons) back to life, as much as they might desire it (herself included), and they should be willing to make concessions for the sake of peace (including the retrieval of Robb's sisters).
