</p><p>While some authors do this as an honest philosophical exercise, it's almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. A self-styled hardline atheist that just happens to live in a high fantasy setting brimming with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon">huge pantheons of gods</a> rampaging around the landscape constantly causing all sorts of things to happen, and the worshipers that pray to (and immediately hear back from) said pantheons of rampaging deities. Maybe they don't believe in the gods at all, and are totally nuts, maybe they're completely in denial about the existence of gods, or maybe they're feigning disbelief in hopes of ending their worship and bringing about some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Götterdämmerung</a> or whatever. Sometimes the character <em>himself</em> is a god (typically a loony one). Sometimes this is a direct attempt to discredit science by comparing it to religion: instead of using the scientific method, as a scientist does, the strawman atheist relies himself on a devout faith — in this case a faith that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">science</a>" holds all the answers, despite obvious proof to the contrary.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The trope can be justified in some ways. It's relatively common to have a character who openly acknowledges the existence of beings of great power, but refuses to accept their divinity (either because he believes them to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> using technological trickery, or because he differentiates between a "real" god and a supernatural being that is merely <em>very powerful</em>). For instance, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> (see below) there's no <em>practical</em> difference between, say, angels and alien energy beings. The main difference often comes down to whether or not the subject in question has deep personal implications, like an afterlife. On the other hand, in a world where magic is commonly known to be real, it becomes a lot easier for con artists to pull the wool over the eyes of innocents, so a skeptic to differentiate between "real" magic and "fake" magic can come in handy.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>After a certain point, however, it can devolve into semantics, and you can start to wonder what exactly a character defines a god or magic <em>as</em>, especially considering some of the entities they encounter are even <em>more</em> powerful than most gods of myth.
</p><p>A subtrope of this is the atheist who's plucked out of the normal world and forced to acknowledge the existence of the supernatural, usually only accepting it after something wildly impossible is done to them (like being turned into a dragon and back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C.

</p><p>Don't confuse this with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a>, who <em>knows</em> supernatural forces exist, but refuses to obey or worship them, often thinking that they should mind their own business and leave mortals alone. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal">Eskimos Aren't Real</a>, which is when a character does not believe in something that everyone else believes, but may in fact have never seen it. The trope also applies to other examples which aren't specifically atheism, but irrational disbelief in some things (such as ghosts) where incontrovertible proof exists of them being real. This also does not relate to atheists literally believing that the Earth is flat.

In other words, while magic is as unrealistic to him as it would be in real life, espers can do comparable things and are scientifically proven in his world, so the powers shouldn't be surprising.

The doctor claims he cannot determine a cause of sickness, which is incredulous taking into account the levitation, horror face and swirling ghost energy around the victim. Doc responds by rolling around on the floor loudly denying the existence of the supernatural in a "La la la I can't hear you" fashion.

Despite the fact that Fujiko, Goemon and Jigen are all smart enough to realize that Kira really is a ghost, Lupin steadfastly refuses to believe the old man's claims, and consistently dismisses his supernatural feats as mere sleight of hand or advanced technology. The fact that Lupin and his pals encounter explicitly supernatural beings multiple times over the course of the franchise's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">decades-long history</a> (including vampires, aliens, zombies, dragons and mermaids) makes it even more bizarre that Lupin apparently chooses to draw the line at the existence of ghosts.

They're very much there in that you see them damage things and affect the real world and such. However, Kaiki doesn't believe that any of them exist even as he speaks with them, considering them hallucinations and lies. Normally he'd come off as crazy, but there's actual support for this viewpoint in the story. For example, he sets a magic bee on the main character's little sister that gives her a burning fever, which an expert says is a magic disease that caused a plague long ago. However, Kaiki has actually researched said plague only to find absolutely no evidence of its existence nor the people it supposedly destroyed. The bee? He actually just hypnotized her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">and gave her a fever like that.</a> The bee doesn't actually exist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The whole worldbuilding in the series is based on the dual nature of the supernatural: it is real, as in it's not just in people's heads, and it is fake, as in it requires people's heads to exist.

Thus both believing in it and disbelieving in it are completely legitimate viewpoints, and your own interaction with the oddities will be determined by that.</span>

<ul><li> A fairly complex example from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StormWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StormWatch">Storm Watch</a>: the Eidolon was a man who died, and instead of reaching the afterlife, he was trapped in a place between life and death—a living ghost who wished to kill people to show the world God didn't exist and this was the only life we have...ok, but here's the issue: he lived in the shared universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a></em>. Not only is there documented evidence of <em>MULTIPLE</em> Gods existing in Image—in particular in the Wildstorm universe he originated from but also the other universes in the Image multiverse—but many of the heroes received powers from or have in some way come into physical contact with Gods. This includes the Judaeo-Christian God, who isn't nearly as nice as he is in the Bible but is, without question, an actual life form. Also, as if this weren't enough, he was a member of a team with no less than three other people who were either Gods, related to Gods or received powers from Gods, including the Goddess of Murder. <em>Also</em> also, Eidolon existed in a world where the ability to travel between universes, access to the afterlife, and even technological exploration of other dimensions—many of which were also ruled by or inhabited by Gods—was not only commonplace but well known to the public. One of the teams in this world, The Authority, rode around in a spacecraft inside of the <strong>fucking arteries</strong> of a being best described as a nicer version of Azathoth! Not just a God, <em>the</em> God! So, in other words, Eidolon is just some mutant who has immortality of a sort, didn't clinically die after being in some accident or whatever years ago, and interpreted this as a confirmation of atheism—even though he has access to a mountain of <em>publicly available</em> scientific evidence debunking atheism top to bottom!

Dr. 13 currently lives outside of the time stream, aware of his own fictional nature; he is teamed with an alien, a vampire, a French caveman, and a talking vampire gorilla with Nazi leanings, his daughter is a rather powerful witch, and he believes none of this.

</li><li> Dr. 13 frequently alternated in stories where the Phantom Stranger appeared opposite him showing a prior story that was pure trickery he'd revealed only to have things a bit more supernatural (obviously) much of but not always when they were together. He also once disproved that ghosts haunted a house by showing it was actually ALIENS using the house as a stopover point as they teleported across the universe. He's always been the example of the devout worshiper of science whose blind-spot always has him refusing to accept the evidence of supernatural things because he operates under the (obviously proven wrong) premise that nothing supernatural actually exists.

</li><li> The hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSavageDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSavageDragon">The Savage Dragon</a></em> remained an atheist even after being sent to Hell (by a villain's magic), witnessing a fistfight between God and Satan, and <em>having a conversation with God</em>. His rationale throughout the whole ordeal was that it was just some weird dream. Later storylines have involved Godworld, a planet housing every god of every pantheon, but these gods are treated like any other superpowered menace, with the question of their legitimacy being unimportant to the story.

In the postboot continuity he scoffs at his teammate Shikari's feelings about finding a way home during the "Legion Lost" storyline. (In his defense, though, the setting he lives in is at the "sufficiently advanced technology" stage or close to it.) If anything, the end of that arc justifies Brainiac 5's skepticism, as the creator deity worshiped by all the local lifeforms turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and former teammate Element Lad</span>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, <em>this</em> version of Brainy is the one who had his appearance and personality "upgraded" by the godlike Anomaly, an encounter that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor">M'Onel</a> and especially Andromeda considered nothing less than a religious experience. On the <em>other</em> other hand, Brainy had eventually expressed worry over the sudden change in his personality, and had deliberately begun reverting back to a muted form of his earlier snarkiness, so who knows how he felt at this point about the Anomaly that caused it.

</div><ul><li> Bill has never outright dismissed or challenged Thor's claims to godhood and made this statement after witnessing the damage of religious wars. His people were destroyed over the struggle between the traditional religions and the new belief of Bill as a god, the Skrull invasion of Earth in the name of their god, a madman causing genocide in the name of his religion, and further Skrull infighting over whether to follow the traditional Skrull gods or take Bill as their new god.

The agents of the Secular Humanist Occult Obliteration Taskforce are atheistic as a rule, despite fighting supernatural forces from various religions. SHOOT considers such entities "Outside Actors" and characterizes them as powerful aliens or somesuch (more "not what they claim" than "not real") — and furthermore holds that buying into the idea that, say, the giant rock guy with writing on his chest is a golem, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">gives him greater power</a>. At various points, many of the characters wonder if they're actually "right"; while the Outside Actors that they encounter seem pretty villainous, SHOOT has no real proof that their interpretation of their actions or their existence is at all accurate. One member actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">secretly secured a document from the Vatican ensuring his passage into Heaven, just in case. He claims there's no doubt in his mind that his position is the right one, but that from a scientific standpoint it would be idiotic to not have a Plan B.</span>
<ul><li> Another character has been trying to avoid her son's questions about what happens after you die, even though his father was a fire-breathing demon with horns and wings and the kid may be the Antichrist.

Not believing there is a God is one thing, but then he also has explicitly said that upon death a person's soul or mind does not "go" anywhere, but simply ceases to exist. That second one seems a strange claim for an atheist in a world where it has been shown that a variety of afterlives do explicitly exist and have been seen numerous times across various series. That aside, a person's mind can exist as a psychic entity completely separated from the body, and several people have blatantly returned from the dead.

There he was informed that the Cleveland government had been aware of the rumors of the "Cleveland Duck Man" for years, and their official policy had always been that he didn't exist. The fact that he was now standing there in front of them was not sufficient reason for them to change that policy. Howard leaves the office in an excellent mood, reassured that he'll never have to pay taxes, be drafted, or interact with the government in any way. Naturally, his luck being what it is, he's eventually forced to register anyway.
</li><li> <em>Emilka Sza</em> (Emily Hush) by Maciej Kur and Magdalena "Meago" Kania. Emilka spends one entire story finding it just hilarious that Justyna believes in ghosts. Emilka being a sceptic is pretty ironic since she herself has supernatural powers and zombies are apparently a normal thing in their universe.
</li><li> Subverted in the latest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletSpider">Scarlet Spider</a></em> series, starring Ben Reilly. He was resurrected and killed through cloning multiple times, and he remembers every one of those instances. The experience has left him with a rather nihilistic outlook on life, as he ponders how he only ever experienced nothingness beyond death. To his credit, he quickly throws this all aside after he encounters <em>the personification of Death, who shows him his own soul</em>. It's like the writer specifically wanted to show how ridiculous strict atheism is in such a fantastical setting.

So an angel makes it happen and walks him through a day in his life as a non-believer. The problem of living as an unbeliever while also witnessing a supernatural event and chatting with an agent of God isn't adressed.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen">Voyage To The Planet Of Prehistoric Women</a></em>, the eponymous women come to accept that their various nature gods are false after they fail to kill the human astronauts. At the end, they declare the humans' dead robot to be their new god. This ignores the fact that their prayers to the gods, although failing to kill the humans, <em>did</em> cause volcanic eruptions and floods, <em>and</em> killed the robot that they accept as the "strongest god".

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> trilogy, there are characters who don't believe that the Force is real, despite it being common knowledge in the prequels (which take place only about 20 years prior, meaning some of said characters would have been alive at the time and seen them first hand). It's partly justifiable as the galaxy is a <em>vast</em> place (about 400 billion stars, 3.2 million inhabitable solar systems, 100,000 light years across and with countless sentient species) so many likely never saw the Force personally, or thought it was exaggerations from the stories they heard (as Han seems to think at first).

Alexander Knox (the only halfway-credible person who believes in Batman from the beginning) points out early on that, for the past month, there has been at least one sighting of Batman every week. But Harvey Dent dismisses the stories of Batman sightings as tales of "ghosts and goblins", and Eckhardt the police lieutenant insists that the slum dwellers who claim to have seen a bat-creature are "drinkin' Drano." Vicki Vale does <em>pretend</em> to believe, but this is only to convince Knox to join her in an official investigation of the sightings, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">Vale hopes will advance her career and maybe even win her a Pulitzer Prize</a>. Commissioner Gordon is the second major character to catch a glimpse of Batman... but he'd rather just sweep the truth under the rug, partly because it would embarrass Gotham City's police and partly because, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Batman was directly responsible for Jack Napier's near-death when the police needed Napier alive as a mob informant</a>, Gordon frankly would rather believe that Batman does <em>not</em> exist.

<ul><li> The Tolnedrans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> worship a god that loves money, which sent them down a road to love money more than Gods, so that they're effectively atheist merchants, and their god couldn't be happier with them. Most Tolnedran characters will cling to their atheism no matter how much the world's supernatural elements prod at them, including a scene where General Varana spends a tactical meeting facing away from the other commanders so that he won't have to see the sorcerers he's working with shapeshifting and casting spells. However, many acknowledge these things do exist, they just "officially" disbelieve them.
<ul><li> Further proof of this trope by the Tolnedrans: according to any Tolnedran, and the entire Tolnedran government, there is no such thing as magic, yet there are also specific laws making it illegal to use the very magic the law makers agree does not exist.
</li><li> Inverted by Brador, the chief of the Mallorean Empire's Bureau of Internal Affairs. He is a Melcene, who, like the Tolnedrans, don't believe in anything supernatural. Along comes Book 3 of <em>the Malloreon</em>, at which point demons start butchering whole cities under the command of a Grolim priest. Brador not only doesn't seem to have any trouble believing demons exist, but he begs Belgarath and Belgarion to help him convince his even more skeptical emperor to call off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> so they can go back and deal with the situation.

</li><li> And then there's Eustace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em>. He refuses to believe that Narnia isn't on Earth, while on a ship whose X.O. is a three-feet-tall <em>talking</em> mouse. The movie throws in a <em>minotaur</em> as the Master at Arms to make this even more ridiculous. The inclusion of the minotaur is made even funnier when he and a human shipmate <em>make fun of</em> Eustace for talking to a seagull and expecting it to respond, with their implication that Eustace <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">ought to have known better</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Prince Rabadash</a> is a variation - although he believes in the Calormene Gods, he also believes that the ending of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">White Witch's</a> eternal winter has come about through "the alteration of the stars and the operation of natural causes." Despite the fact that the Calormenes have been entertaining fauns, talking animals, they know that Narnia is guarded by "a demon...in the shape of a lion" and that the long winter was caused by a witch.
</li></ul></li><li> Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</a></em> is a good example of the subtrope of the atheist dropped into a supernatural world. It takes him the whole first trilogy to accept that The Land isn't just a figment of his imagination. Even then, he doesn't stop believing the Land is a hallucination. He just concludes that it's an <em>important</em> hallucination.
</li><li> Frequently parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, where atheists are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">hit with lightning</a> on clear and sunny days. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em> features Dorfl, a golem who will only believe in gods when they can be proven by rational debate. Offler decides to settle this by hitting him with a lightning bolt but Dorfl simply shrugs this off, saying, "I Don't Call That Much Of An Argument". It seems that Dorfl is the gods' worst nightmare — a <em>ceramic</em> atheist. Fireproof!
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em>, a bartender in an Ephebian bar for philosophers says: "We get that in here some nights, when someone's had a few. Cosmic speculation about whether gods really exist. Next thing, there's a bolt of lightning through the roof with a note wrapped round it saying 'Yes, we do' and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmolderingShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmolderingShoes">a pair of sandals with smoke coming out</a>. That sort of thing, it takes all the interest out of metaphysical speculation."
<ul><li> Which is why the Library of Ephebe is roofed in copper.
</li></ul></li><li> The gods also aren't very fond of being fooled with. A footnote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em> describes one philosopher indulging in the Discworld equivalent of Pascal's Wager<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4j739');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4j739" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4j739');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Roughly, god(s) may or may not exist, but if you pray (sacrifice, act righteously, etc) on the off chance that they do, you're guaranteed a spot in heaven. And if you're wrong, no harm done!</span>... only to wake up in the afterlife surrounded by a lot of deities with pointed sticks saying, "We're going to show you what we think of Mr. Clever Dick in these parts."
</li><li> Sergeant Simony in <em>Small Gods</em>, who tells the manifested god Om, "Don't think you can get round me by existing!" Interestingly, Om doesn't actually mind this, and notes that, as the reason gods want worshipers is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>, such fervent belief in nonexistence works just as well, so an atheist that enthusiastic is actually worth more to a god than a casual churchgoer. Note that Simony literally means the act of selling church offices for profit, something which a true believer would probably not dare to do.
</li><li> Played with in the opposite direction with Mightily Oats from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>, an Omnian reverend who has a crisis of faith throughout the story. Granny Weatherwax helps snap him out of it by telling him that if she saw her god personally save one of his greatest disciples in front of a large crowd, she'd live her life defending her religion to the bitter end.
<ul><li> Granny's standard approach to gods is that just because they exist is no reason to go around worshiping them - it only makes them start putting on airs.

The fact that the Archchancellor and the High Priest are very similar brothers might have something to do with it.
</li><li> Susan Sto Helit was raised to believe that supernatural creatures were nice stories but not actually real, because her parents thought this would shield her from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">her grandfather</a>'s world. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Lemony Narrator</a> puts it, this was a bit like not teaching someone self-defence so that nobody would attack them. (In later books she's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a>; she knows the world of her grandfather and the Tooth Fairy and the Soul Cake Tuesday Duck exists, and she wishes it didn't.)

The heretic Farinata degli Uberti spends his time in Hell glaring contemptuously at every aspect of the afterlife he denied the existence of. He fails to acknowledge his mistake when Dante talks to him and seems single-mindedly fixated on his family's reputation in the physical world, which he still treats as if it was the only world that exists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter">Recurring Character</a> Sanya is a Russian man who was once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possessed by a Fallen Angel</a> and offered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">redemption</a> and a kick-ass magic sword wrought from one of the nails that crucified Jesus, from the hand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">the Archangel Michael himself</a>. He describes himself as agnostic. However he makes no effort to deny the existence (and powers) of the Sword, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">faeries</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">wizards</a>. It's mostly played for laughs, but his argument that the existence of the Swords (and even the Angel) doesn't actually prove anything Theologically in a world packed with so many magical objects and creatures running around <em>is</em> pretty valid. He suggests the Sword (and Angels) could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">a dream he's currently having in a coma</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs">a hallucination of some sort</a>. That said he doesn't think it matters if God is directly involved or even real, as the Sword allows him to do good and help people who need it, and that's all that matters. Or if he's insane he's in no rush to figure it out.
</li><li> Dresden himself, despite having personally seen all three Swords of Faith in action, and having had open discussions with multiple different Angels, doesn't consider himself a "Believer", either. That said this seems to be less about denying the existence of God, and more about a difference of opinion about said Deity's <em>Modus Operandi</em>. He's still occasionally swings by the local Church if he's in need of some holy water (and is on good terms with the local priest).

Their God doesn't respond directly to them and they never see him. However, they do live on a planet with about 1,000 other gods. What is really weird is when the Church Knights (the military arm of the Church) need magic to fight magic, they get four priests from four of the other gods (who, again, the Church says don't exist) to teach them magic. And that magic is praying to the other gods (who according to them don't exist) for spells. Other races of people do find the Elene religion strange that way, especially the ones who actually meet <em>their</em> gods. Amazingly enough, Eddings gets it to work. The Elene god, in fact, is even okay with this. He and the Styric pantheon have a <em>deal</em> worked out.

<ul><li> Interestingly, this series plays with the trope with another character: April, a devout <em>Christian</em> brought to Everworld. While she seems more open to displays of the obviously supernatural, she also claims the various deities aren't "real gods" while at the same time having a small crisis of faith.
</li><li> Jalil's issues are further examined by the other characters' opinions. The acid-tongued, magic-loving Senna in particular has a few interesting things to say about it.

Rather than worshiping them as gods like most mortals aware of their existence, they plan to use their science to either control or destroy these entities. In contrast to the hopelessness that surrounds any human confrontation with the Mythos' various horrifying creatures, you get the feeling that the Mi-Go might just have some chance of pulling it off, probably because, unlike humans, their science is not inhibited by old-fashioned limitations like ethics. When you think about it, they may just be the scariest damn things in the entire Mythos.

As the priest says to Mau, "You want the Gods to exist just enough that you can be angry at them for not existing."
<ul><li> The gods themselves seem more like ineffectual echoes than genuine powers of the universe, so disbelieving them can be seen more as disbelief in their hype of themselves, rather than in their subjective existence (all observations of gods in the book are subjective — no omnipotent narrator's solution is presented).

Charlotte Knowles' father writes detective novels about impossible crimes that always turn out to have non-supernatural explanations, even though he lives in a world where "the murderer used telekinesis to kill the victim from outside the locked room" is entirely possible and much more straightforward than the kind of solution his novels usually have, and refuses to believe that his wife's and daughter's psychic abilities are not some kind of trick that he can't figure out and that they won't admit to. Charlotte says at one point that she suspects on some level he's aggrieved that they both got abilities that let them absorb vast amounts of information instantaneously while he has to do research the difficult and time-consuming way.

He's portrayed very differently in the TV adaptation. It's somewhat justified as magic in general is proven to exist and there are magic users who belong to other religions or who are not religious. The fact that Red Priests are able to use magic and produce what appear to be miracles isn't necessarily proof that their god is real.
</li><li> Richard from <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series denounces the concept of an afterlife where people are rewarded or punished for their actions, because "nobody has ever come back from the grave to describe conditions in the next life."

One of their members does remark that if they were truly committed to scientific reasoning they should try to study the corpse and accept the possibility they'd been wrong all along, but the majority reject her.
</li><li> In Caitlin R. Kernan's novels, the characters spend a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">suspicious amount of time</a> fervently denying anything supernatural is happening... including when they're blasting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">ghouls</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">chunky salsa</a> with shotguns.

Priestly blessings have direct and easily detectable effects, the hero interacts directly with his personal devil who tries to drag him into hell, he runs into at least one saint who tells him what to do after transporting him from a wrecked church into a fully restored one and back again, the act of being knighted by a king (who rules by divine right, and who happens to be mostly dead at the time) actually confers martial abilities, and at the end after the chief bad guy is defeated we see hordes of devils stream out of the sky and compete for his soul, only being banished by the intervention of priests. He converts to the local version of Catholicism by the end of the first book. Stasheff pointed out in the afterword that medieval people saw God and the Devil everywhere in their daily lives, and this book is an attempt to show that where most fiction of this type completely ignores this aspect of their lives.

</li><li> In the setting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s <em>A Maze of Death</em> God is openly real, and prayers are a commonly accepted way of solving problems, though they usually have to be carefully composed and transmitted by radio into outer space in order to work. Dr. Babble, however, is an atheist who believes that the "God" in question is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a>.
</li><li> The characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries">Knight and Rogue Series</a></em> are fully aware that there are two gods out there who somewhat violently protect plants and animals, but as no greater being guards humans there's no serious religious practices.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> series, there are two. Cloudtail refuses to believe that StarClan exists, despite seeing his leader come back to life after being killed and the fatal wounds healing themselves. But even more notable is Mothwing, a medicine cat. She had a prophetic dream herself right after being apprenticed, and everything that Leafpool has told her, which she couldn't possibly have known on her own, happens to be true. She has also seen her own leader lose lives and come back to life. As part of a medicine cat's job is to be the spiritual leader of the Clan, this makes her the equivalent of an atheist priest.
<ul><li> She later starts training a religious apprentice, Willowshine, who knows that Mothwing's an atheist and interprets mystical dreams and omens for her. Mothwing did originally believe in StarClan and see them, but her brother (an evil, manipulative bastard) convinced her that they weren't, and after he dies, she can't quite bring herself to trust in them again. Essentially, she <em>wants</em> to believe in StarClan, but she can't risk getting her hopes dashed again.
</li><li> And in the fourth series, Mothwing's disbelief is finally broken, (according to the author) when <em>the feline equivalent of Heaven and Hell take physical forms on Earth to battle against each other.</em> That's what it took.
</li><li> And earlier in said fourth series, after seeing something that was clearly an omen by cat standards (a burning reed that wasn't extinguished, even by constant rainfall over it) she brought another medicine cat over to see it, saying that she didn't believe it was a sign, but she knew that he would and that it might be important. One imagines that she was just in denial to begin with.

In that book he encounters his long-lost sister who is haunted by the ghost of their late mother. Dunk is unshakably convinced that the ghost isn't a real ghost at all but merely a daemon who (somehow) gained the shape and memories of their mother despite no particular evidence such a thing is possible and his own frequent encounters with more physical undead like vampires.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChantersOfTremaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChantersOfTremaris">Chanters of Tremaris</a></em> has a non-deity version of this trope in the character of Trout, who refuses to believe in the existence of magic, even after he's seen it used. It later turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, as the spell in question was a very, very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic">high-pitched</a> spell of illusion, and Trout is deaf to high noises which rendered him immune to its effects.

The main driver of one of the stories in that book is that an "Old One" is summoned, and is well on its way to destroying the USA. During a conference call with government officials who are deciding how to deal with the Old One, the White God personally speaks through his representative, the main character, and lays down the law. And even then, multiple people in the government still don't believe in deities, and/or refuse to accept their divinity, and refuse to support any actions which might violate the principle of separation of church and state, such as having the President go on television to pray for deliverance from the Old One (who at this point has been shown to be immune to nuclear weapons). Their insistence on not believing, in the face of unequivocal evidence to the contrary, is this trope.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5p77r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5p77r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5p77r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The reader might quickly note that said government officials are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">very poor charicatures</a> of real Democratic politicians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">John Ringo obviously doesn't like</a>.</span>

Magnus, on the other hand, is an atheist. Samirah says that it sounds like the beginning of a bad joke: "An atheist and a Muslim walk into a pagan afterlife..."
<ul><li> Magnus has even more reason to not see any of the Gods in the Riordanverse as capital G beings: his cousin is Annabeth Chase, Daughter of Athena. Bit hard for there to be a Great Plan when there are two wisdom gods (that he knows about) running around, and two gods of thunder, and two gods of the sea. Of course the fact that the various Gods have struggled against other threats in the past DOES mean they're not all powerful, so at a certain point comes down on what exactly makes something a god or not.

</li><li> In the Clone Wars novel <em>Med Star I: Battle Surgeons</em>, arrogant mercenary Phow Ji refuses to believe in the Force, even when it's demonstrated in front of his eyes. This appears to stem largely from his insufferable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">arrogance</a> - he beat a Jedi in unarmed combat (because the Jedi didn't use the Force, to be fair) and is therefore convinced their powers are simply tricks.

Despite the existence of bona-fide <em>holy relics</em> in the form of the Orbs of the Prophets and the sworn statements of several high-ranking Starfleet officers, the Federation still treats the Bajoran Religion as little more than fairy tales. Prophecies and visions of the future are almost always dismissed as hallucinations and wild speculation, despite the <em>well known fact</em> that the incredibly powerful beings known as "the Prophets" exist in a state outside of time and are perfectly capable of giving visions and inspiring prophecies.

The question the show never quite spells out is "what makes a god?" The Founders, despite their legitimate claim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Godhood</a>, are portrayed as just arrogant genetic-engineers (albeit engineers capable of uplifting or even creating entire sentient species). The Prophets, on the other hand, are left more ambiguous in the veracity of their divinity (ultimately a matter of faith): it's granted that they are essentially omniscient, but the matter of their intentions (benevolent or ambivalent) and their power over the physical (or spiritual) world can be unclear.

</li><li> In particular, the Q Continuum are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">literally omnipotent</a>, but they normally don't claim to be gods. The Q who usually interacts with Starfleet characters claimed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> a couple of times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, but only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll</a> the heroes. He later admits to having lied in those cases, though he also claims to be personally acquainted with the Judeo-Christian God and never renounced that particular claim. And in both of those cases, Captain Picard averts this trope. Though he never comes off as religious, his rejection of Q's claims to godhood never involve claims that God doesn't exist. He simply rejects the idea that <strong>Q</strong> could be God, because despite being omnipotent, Q is ultimately just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity">immature</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo">trickster</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>'s Jack Harkness is a possible example. The finale of the first series opens with him scoffing while another character reads from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. By the end of the episode, he's fought a monster named Abaddon.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, The Doctor often appears to be one of these. Generally it's more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus">No Such Thing as Space Jesus</a>. Ghosts? Silly human superstition caused by psychic echoes in the morphic field. And that's even before you get to all the sufficiently advanced aliens (like himself).

<ul><li> In the Expanded Universe, the Doctor discovers beyond a shadow of a doubt, multiple times, that the universe is only scientific in the first place because, in effect, his ancestors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">and maybe himself</a>) cast a magic spell to trick it into working that way.

He is more than happy to believe in Yetis, Psychics, Vampires and Little Green Men, but any hint of an Omnipotent God in the equation and he suddenly becomes more skeptical than Scully at her most ardent. Which makes quite a bit of sense if you consider that he does not need an omnipotent god to explain anything strange until such a being is necessarily part of the occurrence. Scully herself, a Catholic, reverses roles with him on any occasion when the phenomena is religious (nearly always Christian) in nature, immediately shedding any skepticism. It gets very bad in the eleventh season when Scully denies ghosts and the Devil exist-both were shown to be quite real in earlier seasons.

Dean is the primary example. While he very easily believes in the supernatural (hence the name of the show) and Hell, he simply flat-out refuses to believe in things like angels, Heaven, and God. "Gods" are simply very powerful monsters, but you can still "gank" them. Dean is forced to face his lack of belief after he returns from Hell, when faced with the angel Castiel.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> features several characters who refuse to believe in Jesus despite personally witnessing his miracles, prescribing them rather to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">being in league with Satan</a>. In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man begs Abraham to let him warn his relatives of hell after he's sent there, but Abraham cites this trope, saying if they did not believe Moses and the prophets, they would not even if a man came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. Additionally, some modern apologists argue that all atheists are this, claiming they truly do know God exists but simply refuse him worship (i.e. making them actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay Theists</a>). Others dispute this, naturally. It has to be noted that the terms "unbelievers" and "atheists" had broader meanings back in the day, and referred mostly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay Theists</a> and people who might believe God (or gods) <em>existed</em>, but did not <em>have faith</em> in Him / them, though atheists in the sense we know it were also known (from other places largely, such as ancient Greece). There were also of course some who didn't believe the Judeo-Christian god existed, but had their own. In fact though, the opposite was more common-pagans often accepted that God existed, but was just one part of the pantheon, or simply disagreed with specific Christian theology (for instance, a lot of pagan philosophers believed that a supreme deity existed, they just thought him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">becoming a man</a> is absurd).
<ul><li> Very frequently in both the Old and New Testaments, people who have seen indisputable miracles firsthand still find it hard over the long haul to maintain faith in God — faith that the things they saw were what they clearly were, and meant what they clearly meant. The most striking example is the Hebrews making the Golden Calf idol even after the Lord had performed all the miracles of the Exodus in freeing them from Egypt. One interpretation is that when our preconceived notions of the world are rocked, especially in a way that is inconvenient or makes moral demands of us, the human capacity for denial is <em>enormous</em>, whereas in the text itself it seems possibly a case of looking for another god that is viewed as better (since at the time it seems Hebrews believed other gods existed, but forbid worshiping them).

</li><li> In the new edition, a continent as well as two countries have been brought over from a world where gods haven't existed for about 30,000 years, so anyone from there might have a justification.
</li><li> <em>Yet another</em> reasoning behind it is the old Athar standby of agreeing that there does indeed exist powerful planar beings called gods that are worshiped by many — but that doesn't make them <em>proper</em> gods. Considering that (up until 4th Edition) several gods had died within human living memory, you can see where they're coming from. The Defiant (a group of former clerics and paladins) uses this basis to reject belief in the gods' divinity too. Others simply view the gods as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">unworthy of worship</a>.
</li><li> In the backstory of the setting, the empire of Netheril ultimately fell (and magic across the Realms was diminished from what it once used to be) because its wizard-rulers convinced themselves that the "gods" were really just other wizards who knew tricks they didn't feel like sharing. Eventually, one wizard called Karsus <em>did</em> come up with a spell designed to let him attain godhood, and from a certain point of view could be said to have succeeded in casting it, too...but he couldn't handle the sheer <em>power</em> that came with his "success", and that's why the title of the Realms' goddess of magic changed hands from Mystryl (who performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">heroic sacrifice</a> to save the world) to the first Mystra (Karsus himself, unusually for a Netherese archmage, never actually planned to become a god — he was aware that his spell would end with his death, and the entire thing was intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> where he used his temporary godly power to save his people).

The more extreme members of the movement believe that the gods of Oerth are pure fiction and that their clerics are frauds, with clerical magic not granted by divine sources but coming from within like arcane magic or psionics. The more moderate Skeptics admit the <em>existence</em> of beings called gods, but they claim that these gods did not actually create Oerth and furthermore many of them started out as mortals who ascended to demigod status and later to godhood. Therefore the Skeptics deny these gods their faith. They're little more than a fringe group, and the one time a Skeptic gained political power, it turned out to be a disaster—one of the previous Dukes of Urnst drastically raised church taxes when he took the throne, caused a series of riots in the nation's capital, and ended up dying when no cleric would heal him after he was wounded in battle with mountain raiders.

<ul><li> Atheism is common in Lamordia, a domain where mad-scientist-style skepticism prevails. In other domains, heretical philosophers sometimes speculate that divine magic is actually derived from the Dark Powers, rather than the gods it's commonly attributed to; however, as most ordinary people have never even <em>heard</em> of the Dark Powers, theirs remains a minority opinion. (Out of character, it's left up to the DM to choose.)
</li><li> In fact, this was why Dr. Mordenheim was damned and cursed in the first place. He refused to believe in any power greater than man, being an admitted atheist all his life. However, the gods did exist, and they saw his attempts to create life using technology as blasphemies. To punish him, they granted his wish, breathing life into his creation, cursing him with something that would condemn him forever for the evil he was bringing into the world. While Adam, his creation, is the true darklord of Lamordia, Mordenheim is as much a prisoner of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a> as Adam is.
</li><li> In a metagame example, a minority of <em>Ravenloft</em> game masters opt to assume that there <em>are</em> no "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Dark Powers</a>" in their individual campaigns, and phenomena such as the Mists, curses and Powers checks are simply a byproduct of innate metaphysical laws that operate within the setting.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> setting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avoids</a> this trope. Divine Magic is the product of faith, Arcane Magic is just a force of the world. Someone with the proper training could have divine magic if he believed enough. It's even possible for clerics to turn from their religion and keep their spells. In fact, some mortals (and undead) have set up faiths centered around them, and their clerics get divine magic. Gods do not take physical form (except for one, The Traveler, and it's more the stuff of myth, like in ancient Greece). There are miracles which <em>could</em> be the work of the gods, but that is open to interpretation. In the setting, the actual existence of gods is up to a character's belief, as the gods do not act as proactively as they do in the Forgotten Realms, for example. Fiends are the original occupants of the material plane, and their religious implications are downplayed. Angels and Devils are just Outsiders. There are even some books that suggest the gods are based on the legends of certain Dragons.
</li><li> One <em>AD&amp;D</em> sourcebook reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asmodeus</span> feeds on the souls of atheists. The book acknowledged that this is difficult in a setting where Gods are manifestly real. The tactic of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asmodeus</span> is to grant magical powers to someone, allow a cult to grow, and then withdraw those powers. The cultists become disillusioned and believe their leader a charlatan, at which point they are "vulnerable" to atheism.

This actually weakens them: while that philosophy lets them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> many arcane spells, they have no such defense against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">divine magic</a> because they don't acknowledge or understand its source.

<ul><li> The Emperor of Mankind wanted to eliminate all religious beliefs from the Imperium and make mankind trust in science and logic. However, it's heavily implied that the Emperor was more than aware that <em>actual</em> daemons existed, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">trying to starve them</a>, essentially. All was going swimmingly until some of his sons sided with the aforementioned, very real, Chaos Gods and started a galactic-wide rebellion. The cosmic irony is that after these events the Emperor became the official divinity of the Imperium, and it seems he is now forced to work by his faithful people to save mankind from extinction...
</li><li> The Tau also qualify — they believe in the power of logic and science, and refuse to believe in the idea of the truly supernatural, even after repeated battles with Chaos, the Eldar, and the Sisters of Battle. These races employ, respectively, daemons and humans mutated by the Dark Gods (and sometimes both in the same creatures), living avatars of a war god present as figures of molten iron carrying a giant sword and an ever-bleeding hand, and what can only be described as divine magic to the point of one of their heroines self-resurrecting and having a few beings tantamount to angels.
<ul><li> There <em>are</em> fairly reasonable explanations for the various phenomenons they encounter (they may be <em>wrong</em>, but that doesn't mean they don't make sense). There are plenty of genetically modified humans or other alien species, so the idea that Mutants are just another type of these isn't unreasonable. Daemons could easily be just another type of aliens with advanced technology, and <em>Soulstorm</em> shows the Tau hunting for the technology behind the Battle Sister acts of faith (needless to say, without finding it).
</li><li> A large part of the issue is that the Tau are simply unfamiliar with Chaos and Psykers. There are no Tau psykers, and psykers are required for daemons to take physical form. They certainly don't deny the existence of Daemons or the effects of Psykers after they have encountered them, even if they fail to properly understand them. Hence the short story where a Tau army believes they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">slew</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Slaanesh</a> — they had no idea about the existence of Chaos Space Marines or Chaos Gods at the time, so they were unaware that Slaanesh was the name of that band's patron deity as opposed to their commander. It's this ignorance that makes them so dangerous in the eyes of the Imperium; they consider the Tau <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
</li><li> This also makes them dangerous to Chaos as well. As the Tau have a Warp presence that's practically nonexistent, they have an innate resistance if not immunity to daemonic influence. This means that the usual tricks employed against the Eldar or Imperium don't work on them, and as the Tau's sphere of control grows, the area that Chaos can influence shrinks. The Tau <em>at best</em> see the servants of the Dark Gods as psychotic maniacs and would rather not tamper with their tools, seeing as they <em>might</em> have something to do with the madness. They even go so far as to kill Kroots who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian">consume</a> Chaos Space Marines.
</li><li> Turns out the Ethereals know damn well that Chaos is real but hide this knowledge from the rest of the Tau. The main reason Commander Farsight formed his own breakaway colony away from the Ethereals is because he figured this out. He believes that denying the existence of the supernatural is a mistake and that the Tau cannot prevail with their technology alone. They need magic of their own. Farsight puts this philosophy into practice on the battlefield, wielding a Warp-based sword called the Dawn Blade.

<ul><li> The official policy of the Empire is that the Skaven don't exist. Apparently dragons, giants, lizardmen, zombies, goat-headed mutants, and inconceivably powerful chaos gods are fine but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen">five-foot-tall intelligent bipedal rats</a> are just too much. Its unclear if anyone actually believes this policy, however. Indeed one sourcebook states that "there are two myths about the Skaven: The first is that they don't exist. The second is that anyone believes in the first." In general, it seems that there are two reasons for the stories of Skaven not existing:
<ul><li> Firstly, the Skaven themselves put a lot of work into maintaining this status quo, killing or bribing people who learn too much, and stealing physical evidence. They even have magic that makes people not want to believe in them.
</li><li> The second reason is that the Skaven are large, organized, and extremely close (as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreEverywhere">everywhere</a> all the time). Every other threat to humanity is either small (like chaos cults), disorganized (like beastmen), or far away (like the gods of chaos). So while the Skaven aren't the most serious threat they're the one most likely to cause paranoia and constant terror.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a>, however, where it's kind of hard to disbelieve a dragon staring you in the face, it became more of a matter of defiance.

There is an NPC whose skepticism is so strong, he has an antimagic aura. Which, in turn, makes any attempt to prove the existence of the Unnatural to him impossible.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OverTheEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OverTheEdge">Over the Edge</a></em> with Evan MacDonald, whose skepticism is so great he nullifies <em>anything</em> beyond the mundane around him, be it magic or "just" mad science.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original campaign, <em>Prophecies</em>, has a wonderful moment where an NPC rants about how she doesn't believe in any Gods after your latest mission goes awry. This is a bit ridiculous, since she's standing next to a person who can revive the dead using the power of faith and lives in a world where praying at a shrine will grant you improved skills. Since the plot of that campaign can be summed up as: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">"Oh hey, you just made everything worse! Again!"</a> it may be safe to assume that the Gods are helping you just so that they can point and laugh when you fail.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, each race has a view on the gods. While only the humans believe in them, the other races are not atheist <em>per se</em>: the Asura simply consider the gods as part of the Eternal Alchemy, like everything else; the Charr were so scarred by the Shamans that they decide to not <em>revere</em> the gods, but do not deny their existence; the Norn simply have their own deities in the Spirits of the Wild. As for the Sylvari, since they only appeared a few decades ago, i.e. 1300 years after the Gods left Tyria, they just want evidence, making them the closest example of this trope, considering that, y'know, humans are able to summon Hounds of Balthazar and stuff like that. The Sylvari have the innate ability to bring huge trees to life, so they aren't completely unreasonable in wanting proof those hounds come from a higher power.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a>,</em> Dr. Cranium does not believe in magic, insisting that any claims are merely the result of superstition and that everything can be explained by science. The game even suggests that there's probably magic involved in the healing potions he makes for you, but advises you not to point that out to him. If you're a Wizard, you can try to debate him, at which point he brings up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">Clarke's Third Law</a>, and he can give you a magic scroll that he claims is full of illegible scrawlings: when you read it and learn the spell, prompting the scroll to vanish, he points out that it was a particularly shoddy piece of parchment to "fall right apart" like that.
<ul><li> The same "ignorance" pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryV">Quest for Glory V</a></em>. It seems to be a core feature of the scientist subculture that Dr. Cranium is a part of. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, towards the end it is revealed that this subculture has been well aware of magic all along. Their denial of magic is not ignorance, but instead a dogma about magic being a heinous crime against reality itself. If you're a Wizard, they even try to assassinate you for your crimes.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Dungeons and Dragons: Order of the Griffon</em>, the heroes are hired by Lord Korrigan of Radlebb Keep to investigate and debunk the rumors of the vampire Koriszegy in the ruins of Koriszegy Keep. He insists that the vampire is a myth and he's only hiring you to debunk the rumors to end the panic. He does tell you that you might meet some minor undead like skeletons and zombies, maybe a ghoul or something. Needless to say, Koriszegy is quite real, and quite dangerous: he nearly succeeds in destroying Karameikos. Somewhat justified by the fact that it's an established fact of the setting that the Thyatian rulers of what used to be Traladara, now Karameikos, tend to hold their Traladaran subjects in contempt as superstitious and ignorant.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">Pretentious Artist</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> is one of these. You only find this out if you show up at his place decked out in all of the Bad Moon rewards, and he states that he isn't sure whether he believes in Hey Deze, "even though people go there all the time and bring back souvenirs."
</li><li> Dr. Aleister Grout, the Malkavian Primogen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em> firmly believes there's a rational explanation for the fact that he's a vampire and all the obviously supernatural things they can do. It's somewhat implied that this is actually the manifestation of his Malkavian insanity. Also implied to be his insanity is his methods. The good doctor is a clinical case of antisocial personality disorder taken to eleven.
</li><li> Arcoscephalean skeptics in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions">Dominions</a></em> world are atheistic philosophers who use their acerbic wit to mock belief in the gods. This is quite strange during an epic war between demigods battling to become the one true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. Even worse, the nation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Arcoscephale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">itself</a> is ruled by a pretender god who can order the skeptics about.
</li><li> Another one like Han Solo; Tharan Cedrax, one of the Consular's companions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, travels with a Jedi and was acquainted with Master Syo. Yet, he <em>really</em> dislikes anything that smells of Jedi mysticism and overt Force use in his presence (especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">Jedi Mind Trick</a>). It could be explained by the fact that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggle</a> like himself cannot analyze, measure, or experiment with it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009">Wolfenstein</a></em>, after the mission where BJ receives the Thule Medallion and first learns of the Golden Dawn (a benevolent order of mystics), he can talk to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> radio operator who claims that the Golden Dawn's leader seeks to "save the world from black magic. Which means he's either insane or an idiot". You could interpret that as BJ keeping the Medallion's powers a secret...if not for the fact that completing the aforementioned mission also causes <em>black clad Nazi sorcerers</em> to fight openly in the city they are in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> brings us Leah, whose childhood was spent following her uncle Deckard Cain, who was trying to research ways to prevent the forces of Hell from bringing about the End Times. In fairness, Deckard admits that things were peaceful the last twenty years, but one would think that she might give her uncle the benefit of the doubt after seeing zombies rise in front of her and experiencing her own supernatural powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She only decides Deckard might have a point after he is murdered by cultists and then finding out that one of her companions is a literal Angel.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em>, the justice minister loudly denies the existence of ghosts, even after Sissel goes back and saves him from dying of a heart attack. Then it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was mostly trying to convince himself, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">being manipulated</a> by Yomiel into signing Jowd's execution order and spending the last few weeks covering it up.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> is particularly ridiculous, where you can play as an atheist even though your mission is to preform a sacrifice to your god in the astral plane.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, Detective Dojima refuses to believe his nephew when he tells him that the murders were committed by supernatural means, even though the very-much supernatural Midnight Channel-rumor, which can be easily observed, proven and linked to the murders (and that the police was actually quite aware of, as several other characters' knowledge of it, such as that of Naoto Shirogane, proves). This is averted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Persona4DancingAllNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Persona4DancingAllNight">Persona 4 Dancing All Night</a></em>, where Dojima is a bit more open-minded to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kanami</span>'s claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> several people were kidnapped by demonic ribbons from an inter-dimensional portal</span>, due to his experiences in the original game.
</li><li> Wol in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MobiusFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MobiusFinalFantasy">Mobius Final Fantasy</a></em> refuses to accept that gods exist in Palamecia because they would have stopped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Chaos</a> from appearing. This, despite the fact that he was brought to Palamecia from his own planet by a near-omniscient, all-powerful astral being attempting to find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a> able to stop Chaos. The setting he admits this in is a part of the world created by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Warring Triad</a>, to boot.
</li><li> Any Empire with the <em>Materialist</em> ethos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions</a>. Yeah, go ahead and tell that to the Extradimensional Invaders, Dimensional Horrors, the Worm-in-Waiting, those entities in The Shroud offering you to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">covenants</a> with them (which materialists will technically never encounter), or any Spiritualist Empire wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psionic techs.</a> Of course, thanks to the research bonuses that come with the ethos they can do so <em>with gusto</em>.
<ul><li> Materialists actually have easy explanations for these things, since sufficiently advanced technology is literally everywhere and alternate dimensions and realities aren't much less common than that so what's one more? There are even late game events that hint that the materialists might be right after all. The game does a decent job of keeping it ambiguous.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>: Dialogue options allow the player character (in every game) to be atheistic, or at least reject the Chantry faith (despite events in Dragon Age: Origins, at least, reinforcing their concept of Andraste as divine.) The Dalish gods are similarly rejected by many characters, mostly the Chantry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they did exist, although it's revealed in Dragon Age: Inquisition that they weren't much more than powerful mages.</span> And while what Dwarves believe are usually down to the individual, they generally focus their worship on Ancestors and Paragons, and reject all other faiths as a breach of tradition.
</li><li> Though we don't see them, they do exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em>. Unlike most examples, it's not so much that they don't believe the goddesses exist, but that they're mortals with extremely powerful Parasites rather than divine beings. Considering that one playable character - Eliza - is exactly that and incredibly long-lived, it's a lot more reasonable than you'd expect.

This wouldn't be a problem, except they live on their planet-sized creator. This is actually based on Jetfire's personality in the comics.

The above comic is not exaggerating. The fact that he was <em>made</em> by a <em>very</em> intelligent designer (Shockwave) in the Marvel comics makes this even funnier.

</li><li> The MUniverse contains multiple religions, each with its own distinct (and in some cases conflicting) mythology/theology, all of which are apparently real. So it's fairly easy to see how people might get confused. To quote the author:
<div class="indent">In most fantasy worlds, because "the gods are real", there's one set of myths which are only myths in that they're mythic in scope... they're essentially true and everybody knows them and agrees on them, and if there's any dissent it's a big story point because either the dissenters are eeeeeevillll or they're secretly the good guys. Even if the elves have one set of myths and the dwarves have another, it's only because they have different gods and their myths only deal with their corner of the world. With everything else they fight about, you rarely see the dwarves and elves falling out because one believes the world was made from the bones of Fireaxe Grimbeer and the other thinks it was fashioned in seven days by Emostar Vaguelygay, because those gods are real in the story and therefore not subject to this kind of disagreement. I don't really buy the logic there. Our world is made of real and we can't often agree on any two things inside it. Ignoring the possibility of any actual divine/supernatural stuff existing in our world, all of our conflicting myths and legends came about because of real, (at one time) verifiable events: wars, people, seasons, animals, whatever. Adding another class or two of things to those lists wouldn't change the essential nature of the beast, which is that 1) we like to make stuff up when we don't know something and 2) we frequently don't know shit.

They are a dangerous joke to every other group involved with the anomalous, and are very hypocritical, as they will use anomalies to spread their ideas, despite not believing in their existence.

<ul><li> In fairness to Sokka, while the spiritual elements of the world do absolutely exist, aside from when Aang is directly involved ("Avatar stuff"), the appearance of spirits or other supernatural effects (outside of bending, of course) is exceedingly rare.

</li><li> Also applicable is "Red Hot Catholic Love", where most of the boys' parents became atheists and celebrate over the fact that the Vatican was destroyed, despite the fact that it was destroyed through supernatural means and a giant Queen Spider is clearly present- plus, you know, again the fact that they all knew God, Satan and Jesus were all real and had seen them in person.

Matt Stone has said often he personally doesn't believe in any religion and Trey Parker says his idea of faith is difficult to explain, but he finds both religion and atheist viewpoints equally absurd to comprehend.

</li><li> In an interview, they mentioned they are fascinated by religion and while they call all the religions wonderfully ridiculous, they then add that the most ridiculous explanation was that they were all existing, just because (as in the Big Bang and so on was a result of natural forces.)

This despite the fact that a) he once met God and temporarily gained enlightenment, b) his mother's repressed sexuality once manifested as a ghost and attacked the house, c) his family has a long-running feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta">Santa</a>, d) his grandfather is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKrampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKrampus">The Krampus</a>, and e) his sister once adopted the baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist">Antichrist</a>, who proceeded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> Steve for most of the episode. Given all that, his VERY SUDDEN lack of belief is rather odd. (An argument <em>could</em> be made that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episodes</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon">Loose Canon</a>, but that doesn't explain the first two.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw">Milo Murphy's Law</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Zack</a>'s father is the only person who has ever doubted the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryCurse">Murphy's Law</a>; every other character, no matter how rational, pretty much accepts it instantly. Though admittedly, even Mr. Underwood's skepticism couldn't survive a whole afternoon of being around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx">Milo and Martin</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: The episode "Let's Play Magicians" revealed that Kaeloo and Mr. Cat don't believe in magic... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">despite the fact that they live on a planet that runs on magic.</a>
<ul><li> Mr. Cat is skeptical of everything, from aliens to ghosts, despite having encountered aliens, spirits, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> counterparts of himself and his friends, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>.
</li><li> Happens literally in "Let's Play Golf":
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Cat</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Who said our planet had to be round?</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9w6x7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9w6x7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9w6x7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The characters live on Planet Smileyland, not Planet Earth</span>
</div></li><li> Naturally used for a joke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, when the gang is under attack by a killer Santa Claus.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> Well, guess what? I don't believe in Santa Claus! C'mon, everybody! If you don't believe in him he can't hurt you! <br/><strong>Santa:</strong> <em>(Smacks his bag under Bender's head)</em> <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> AGH! OH, GOD, THE PAIN!
</div></li><li> Velma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> is usually adamant that magic and ghosts don't exist, though some installments make this a more defining trait than others. Television series such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewScoobyDooMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewScoobyDooMovies">The New Scooby-Doo Movies</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> will either have her actually lament about real monsters not existing or slowly come to accept them existing once she has evidence of it. Meanwhile, movies such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost">Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost</a></em> will have her continue to deny the existence of the supernatural despite having irrefutable proof in front of her.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, Brain presents an interesting case. He flat-out tells Pinky that writing a letter to Santa Claus is "silly" and "stupid" and says that he keeps his Christmas spirit "right next to my Bigfoot photos." This despite the fact that he <em>knows for a fact</em> that Santa exists, because his whole plan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> depends on infiltrating the North Pole and tricking Santa into building and distributing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice">Mind-Control Device</a> toys. Though he may actually be referring to the notion rather than the logic; he simply finds writing Santa a letter incredibly pointless due to the impracticality rather than futility. To be fair, it's not likely that Pinky and the Brain are on Santa's "Good" list.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Pick <em>any</em> Christmas movie or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a> in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> is real and actively delivers presents to a large fraction of the world's children, yet the vast majority of adults do not believe in him. Review the situation: mysterious packages show up under Christmas trees that Mom and Dad certainly don't remember buying. Little Sally in the hovel next door ends up with an expensive doll in her stocking despite her parents barely being able to afford necessities and keeping the doors locked for fear of burglars. Yet despite these otherwise inexplicable occurrences, people dismiss Santa as a fairy tale or "stuff for babies."
<ul><li> Worse, in the Christmas movies/specials where Santa Claus not only exists, but <em>doesn't even try to hide his existence</em> — to the point where you'd easily be able to see the man just by waiting outside on Christmas Eve, or even by <em>telephoning the North Pole</em>.
</li><li> Taken to hilarious extremes, for the sake of a joke, in the Rankin-Bass film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwasTheNightBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwasTheNightBeforeChristmas">'Twas the Night Before Christmas</a></em>, in which a young atheist mouse says he doesn't believe in Santa... despite Santa having <em>a phone number</em> and a <em>staff of people to answer any calls</em>. When he says this, the athe-mouse's dad gives him a look that is the 70's animated special equivalent of "Wow, you're spectacularly dumb". This is a world where Santa is <strong>so clearly and explicitly real</strong> that when he <em>tells</em> the town's mayor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he won't come here this year due to the athe-mouse insulting him in a newspaper</a> (yes...) the mayor attempts to build a huge beacon to tell Santa how much they're really, really sorry. In other words, Santa is at least as real as any other businessman the town is trying to curry favor with. And the athe-mouse kid still didn't believe it till his father showed him <strong>everyone else in town did</strong>. The irony? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowitall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowitall">Athe-mouse is the SMART one in his family</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">by his reckoning</a>). Yikes.
<ul><li> But when trying to convince the mouse, his dad tries to make his son have faith using an argument that doesn't factor in empirical proof (the song "Give Your Heart a Try"), despite the fact that there <strong>is</strong> empirical proof of Santa in this universe.
</li></ul></li><li> It's even worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheYearWithoutASantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheYearWithoutASantaClaus">The Year Without a Santa Claus</a></em> when a bunch of children announce that the newspapers have reported that Santa Claus is taking a day off and <strong>ten seconds later</strong> say that they don't believe in Santa. Santa himself sings a song to convince one of the children of his existence: "I believe in Santa Claus / Like I believe in love..." <em>not</em> "I believe in Santa Claus / Because I saw his picture in <em>The New York Times</em>..."
</li><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> review of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" in which the villains try to sue Santa Claus for kidnapping, which makes the headline in the paper.
<dl><dd><div class="indent"> <strong>Nostalgia Critic:</strong> No... the headline should be "HOLY SHIT SANTA CLAUS IS REAL!!!"
</div></dd></dl></li><li> The same logic would apply to the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy as well.
</li><li> In one short of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em>, not only Dexter doesn't believes in Santa Claus (he insists that it's his parents delivering the presents), his thoughts run on sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> even when he's supposed to be super-smart (he not only thinks that Dad dresses like Santa and his mom dresses like Rudolph, he says that the two of them somehow <em>get the family's station wagon onto the roof to simulate the sled</em>). When confronted by Santa and Rudolph, he insists on calling them "Dad" and "Mom" and asks "Mom" to take off the costume even when Rudolph is very visibly an actual reindeer and tries to shave off "Dad's" "fake beard" even when Santa fights back and run like hell, and culminates with Dexter chasing the flying "station wagon" and <em>shooting it down with a fighter jet</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">ruining Christmas for everybody</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An old Soviet joke runs something like this: a communist (and thus staunch atheist) died. However, he had been a good man in life, and God was willing to forget his unbelief, provided that he spent an equal period of time in Hell and Heaven. He served his first year in Hell, and Satan said to God: "Take this man quickly - he has turned all my demons into Young Pioneers! I must restore order!" After spending a year in Heaven, God took him back to Hell, where he had this conversation with Satan:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Satan:</strong> Lord God, it is my turn now.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>God:</strong> First of all let's keep this quick, I have a party meeting. Second, call me "<em>Comrade</em> God". Third, there is no God.
</div><ul><li> In the Spanish version of the joke, it's Karl Marx himself who dies and is sent straight to Hell, where he promptly starts getting rank-and-file demons to make common cause with the damned. Satan tries to get rid of him by shipping him into Heaven, half-expecting the guys Above to reject him. When he goes up to Heaven to check after a few days, it's Peter who greets him and informs him that "there is no God."
</li></ul></li><li> In one Spanish comic strip, an atheist climbs into a tree to escape a bear. An angel flies down to meet him, and the man insists he's not going to convert just because an angel saved him (although this example overlaps with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a> trope). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The angel then reveals he came to help <em>the bear</em>, who is a Christian and is thanking God for this meal.</span>
