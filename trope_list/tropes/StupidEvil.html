</p><p>In video games, this often results from poor implementation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>. These games need to provide the player with the opportunity to be evil, but their evil actions usually can't go too far without either breaking the game's narrative or going over the line into uncomfortable territory. Because of this, most "evil" options in games take the form of random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a> moments, most of which offer little to no gain (extorting a quest-giver to slightly increase a meager reward) or are even harmful to you (killing off a potential ally). In games where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality">having very low karma provides some kind of benefit</a>, it turns into players aiming to get the lowest as quickly as possible, which invariably leads to this trope in terms of how their character will act.

They then decide to go through with the assassination anyway, even after it's pointed out to them that they are no longer being paid (in fact, they already took the money in the process of killing their employer). It should also be noted that their target makes a policy of surrounding herself with some of the most deadly soldiers in the world, is a world-class markswoman in her own right, and is justifiably considered within the series to be the most dangerous woman alive...and the twins try to take her out armed only with an axe.

</li><li> Chaka, a low-level enforcer for the Washimine Clan, was so needlessly and gratuitously cruel and sadistic that it's truly a wonder that he didn't piss off the wrong people and get himself killed earlier. Among other things, he kidnapped the daughter of his employers with the intention of selling her into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sexual slavery</a> (and decided to strip her down to her underwear just for extra humiliation), tried to start a fight with someone who was <em>way</em> above his level just because he really wanted a duel, beat her non-combatant colleague just to try and get her to fight him after she made it clear that she couldn't care less about him, took the person he was going to sell and used her as a human shield, ran off and left a bunch of his men to get slaughtered by Revy and Ginji, shot several of his men just to vent his anger, and then tried to fight Revy yet <em>again</em>. That last one wound up being what got him killed, as while she still had absolutely no intention of fighting him, she was all too happy to turn him over to Ginji, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">had every reason to go after him</a> and wound up killing him swiftly and brutally.

Of course, he was also operating under the flag of the Warlord of the Sea Donquixote Doflamingo, who was <em>not</em> pleased to find out that he was being associated with Bellamy's idiocy, which led to Bellamy getting stabbed and kicked out of Doflamingo's gang. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He got <em>much</em> better over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip">Timeskip</a> after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a>, to the point Luffy actually considered him a friend and went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">to town on Donflamingo</a> after the Warlord played Bellamy for a fool and forced him to fight Luffy to the death.</span>
</li><li> Don Krieg is one of <em>the</em> premiere examples of the series. Most of his arc would have never occurred if he hadn't decided to terrorize the staff of the Baratie just to be a dick, and he probably would have kept far more of his crew if he hadn't decided to continue to go after Mihawk just to save his wounded pride even after it was made very clear that Mihawk was <em>light years</em> above him.
</li><li> Caesar Clown embezzles research funds from <em>Big Mom</em> of all people, trusting in his indirect connection to Kaido through Doflamingo to keep him safe. Big Mom is one of the Four Emperors and has a reputation for being inventively gruesome to people who defy her. When Doflamingo goes down, Caesar winds up having to produce the gigantification serum she wanted in two weeks... or else get turned into candy by Perospero's Lick-Lick fruit powers.
</li><li> Jack, a commander under the pirate Emperor Kaido, one of the most powerful men in the world, possesses both an insatiable bloodlust and extreme confidence in his (admittedly impressive) strength that leads him to make <em>many</em> costly decisions that could have been mitigated or avoided entirely if he utilized a little something called "tact":
<ul><li> Introduced in the Zou arc, he comes to Mokomo Dukedom, the country on Zou, looking for a specific individual their info said would be there. The residents state outright that they don't know the person he's asking for, but are willing to cooperate with his search in order to avoid trouble. Jack responds by siccing his underlings on them, destroying the country, and torturing them for information that, by all indications, they did not have. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In truth, they <em>did</em> know where to find who Jack was looking for, but were determined not to give it up, and Jack never discovered that nor had any hint to it.</span>
</li><li> He goes on to attempt to bail out a newly-arrested Donquixote Doflamingo even after being informed that the odds are objectively hopeless, since Doflamingo's transport fleet is guarded by people who could give <em>his boss</em> trouble, let alone him, and gets beaten to a bloody pulp for his trouble, though he gets away alive.
</li><li> Jack finishes by attempting to kill Zunisha, the gigantic (think particularly huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland">Turtle Island</a>) elephant for which Zou gets its name, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">a single sweep of its trunk later</a> he loses his ship and only survives dropping into the ocean because he's a fishman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">while still utterly paralyzed at the bottom because he's a Devil Fruit user</a></span>.

<ul><li> What further increases his stupidity is that he's <em>advised</em> by Ansbach to provide a more proper punishment. His justification is that since it's <em>his</em> planet, he has the right to do it. His reckless actions are even lampshaded by the same adviser, stating how the Goldenbaum dynasty can't survive when it cuts itself apart.
<ul><li> This is debatable since Braunschweig lost a relative from the same protest, which made him very unstable.

<ul><li> Paul trained his Chimchar vigorously enough that it was legitimately exhausted enough not to be able to battle the next day. We know this because Nurse Joy, a medical professional, told him this. So what does he do? He forces Chimchar to battle anyway, and then when she turned out to be right, he was, for some reason, disappointed by this and left Chimchar, thinking it was simply too weak. This led to Ash taking Chimchar into his care and raising it into one of the strongest members of his team. Not only that, it was the Pokémon that defeated Paul in a later battle.
</li><li> Team Rocket, oh so very much. They're so dumbly obsessed with <em>stealing</em> valuable Pokémon that they haven't taken the time to even think about Meowth. <em>A Pokémon that speaks human language fluently could be the single most valuable and useful Pokémon in existence</em>: He could solve countless problems between humans and Pokémon, and could give priceless insight on the behavior and mental abilities of every Pokémon to have ever lived (which, in a world with a culture so heavily ingrained with said creatures, would be a big deal). They would go down in history and be amongst the richest people on the planet if only they put Meowth to proper use instead of blindly chasing some kid and his Pikachu.
<ul><li> In fact, James and Jessie would probably succeed if they just quit Team Rocket altogether. It seems the only time they succeed at anything or do anything right are the brief times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">they call a truce with Ash for one reason or another.</a> But they never learn.
</li><li> Moreover, you'd think the rest of the Team Rocket organization would stop giving the bumbling trio so many exotic, expensive gadgets after maybe the fiftieth time they proved too incompetent to catch any valuable Pokémon with them (although it's implied it may be money from James' estate since he's the son of apparently the richest people in the world).

<ul><li> Yami Marik has a few bouts of this, most notably when he sabotages Noah's computer system during the Virtual Nightmare Arc, not seeming to realize that destroying it would kill both Yugi and Kaiba, ruining the most vital part of his master plan: gaining their two Egyptian God Cards. (To make things worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">he laughs like a lunatic</a> while doing it.)
<ul><li> The regular Marik does something <em>very</em> stupid too (which was the biggest reason his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a> took over in the first place).

Rishid is smart, knows that it would likely be dangerous to use it, and would have beaten Jonouchi/Joey without it, but when it seems likely that everyone will figure out that Rishid is acting as Marik's stand-in, Marik orders him to use it in order to cover up Marik's true identity. Rishid complies, and... it turns out Marik <em>really</em> should have listened to Rishid because the real Ra ended up destroying the fake copy along with both the duelists and Jounouchi managed to win when he shouldn't have...
</li></ul></li><li> Yami Bakura shows this in his duel against Yugi in one of the final episodes of the series. He uses a card which forces Yugi to discard the same number of cards from his deck as the number of monsters that are on the field, and combines this with another card that eliminates his own graveyard, making him immune to the effect and allowing his monsters to remain on the field as phantoms (without the ability to attack or defend, but still counting as monsters) to cause Yugi to lose the duel by completely depleting his deck. It eventually gets to the point where Bakura could win the duel simply by ending his turn without making a single move, something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">he even points out</a>, but he decides instead that watching Yugi squirm would be more fun and continues the duel. Yugi is left with only one card left in his deck, but it just so happens to be the exact card needed to defeat Yami Bakura's strategy, which costs him the duel.

His ace card was Exodius the Forbidden Lord. It seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">completely indestructible and immune to all card effects</a>, and granted him an automatic win if it attacked five times.

The first example was when he gave IV a Spell Card called Flaming Hell Blessing to use in a duel against Rio Kamishiro; it won the duel for him, but it also caused a raging fire that destroyed the building they were in. Rio was in the hospital for months recovering; IV managed to get out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(carrying Rio to safety before she was killed)</span>, but not unscathed. The accident left a scar on his face that never healed.

Why didn't he want her to recognize him? Danzo hoped they'd kill each other because they were too knowledgeable as spies.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Umbrella Corporation</a> in the film series seems to live and breathe Stupid Evil. The company's actions are geared entirely towards nothing more than propagating the existence of a deadly, uncontrollable virus that has no discernible practical applications.
</li><li> Particularly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilExtinction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilExtinction">the third film</a>, wherein <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the whole planet has been reduced to an arid desert</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> (somehow) and money no longer matters to the roving bands of survivors. Yet Umbrella keeps making new strains of the T-Virus to sell to... actually, the films <em>never</em> explain who they hope will buy the damn thing. It could at least be shakily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in the previous films by concluding that, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">the games</a>, Umbrella planned to sell the virus to bioterrorists, insurrectionists, or even warring nations, but who's left at this point? And even if such parties did still exist, who would want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> in its current state? They <em>do</em> explain at one point that they intend to refine the virus so that it can turn those that are already zombies into something resembling domesticated workhorses and stop them from eating people, which makes some sense. However, they are far too incompetent to ever pull that off.
</li><li> In a film series full of evil Umbrella leaders, Dr. Isaacs probably takes the cake in terms of this Trope. His obsession with Alice leads to him disobeying direct orders from Wesker to leave her be and falsifying orders of his own to release (already pretty scarce, both because of general wasting and his lousy experimentation method) resources in order to hunt her down, which leads eventually to the destruction of the only other Umbrella facility in North America (and to not mention constantly cloning Alice and leading the clones into an endless massacre of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a>, which not only provides an immense number of cadavers that (being improperly disposed of) leads to the Umbrella facility being surrounded by a humongous swarm of zombies but doesn't really seems to be of any use other than Isaacs' sick amusement). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the <em>original</em> Dr. Isaacs appears in <em>The Final Chapter</em>, he turns out to be both this (because he's the one leading the little plot twist mentioned below) and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a>, to boot. This also gets him killed — he decides to keep his entire focus on Alice without thinking what the clone Isaacs he just told is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpendableClone">Expendable Clone</a> would do as a response to <em>that</em> bombshell being dropped on him.</span>
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilRetribution">Resident Evil: Retribution</a></em> involves Umbrella perfectly recreating sections of major cities in underground facilities, cloning large numbers of humans, and implanting them with false memories of living in a real city — all for the sake of infecting the mini-city with the T-Virus and showing the footage to potential buyers. Not only would all three of the steps taken cost Umbrella more money to pull off than they could ever hope to make off selling the virus, but any one of these innovations would make Umbrella rich if they didn't waste them on furthering their T-Virus initiative. And again, it's worth reminding they're still running these experiments and demonstrations for no clear reason.
</li><li> And then it turns out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilTheFinalChapter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilTheFinalChapter">Resident Evil: The Final Chapter</a></em> that, not unlike the original game series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they produced the T-Virus and funded all of the crazy stuff that had appeared throughout the series (genocidal Artificial Intelligences, a virus with the capacity to destroy the world, cloning technology, cryogenics) in an attempt to take out mankind and have it be reborn for the corporation's executives to lord over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">as "gods."</a> Considering how much crazy tech they had going around, they could have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">probably managed to rule as gods</a> over a <em>populated</em> Earth instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>.

Lickers and other creatures are depicted as being very, very effective weapons in the right context. <em>Damnation</em>, though, is made by Capcom and is canon with the games; their characterization of the villains is <em>somewhat</em> less recklessly stupid compared to their film counterparts (to wit, Umbrella Inc. had already collapsed under the weight of its blunders by the time someone got around to using their B.O.W.s in a military context).

He could simply <em>trust</em> that the person who released him would have three things that they wanted to wish for (and odds of that are pretty high), but instead, he insists on causing mayhem and destruction whenever someone makes a wish (particularly random people who <em>aren't</em> the person who can free the genies with three wishes), ensuring that whoever actually <em>did</em> free him will never make their three wishes. Of course, he does have <em>some</em> justification.

<ul><li> The Dark Side — and the Sith philosophy in particular — are prone to this. The Sith encourage selfishness and not controlling your emotions, which meant that pretty much all Sith were too impulsive to get anything really done. Any time they actually tried to get a complete order together, they were done in by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a> that pretty much all Sith had, necessitating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo">Rule of Two</a> just to keep the order alive. Making things worse, any Sith steeped enough in the Dark Side to become truly powerful tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">become blind to the Light Side</a>, which tripped Darth Sidious up when he couldn't sense Luke at a critical moment and didn't notice that his apprentice Darth Vader still had some good in him.
</li><li> There is also Grand Moff Tarkin. When he destroyed the populated planet Alderaan as a show of force, he guaranteed that many of the population of the Empire would realize the pure evil of its government and the Rebel Alliance would have a surge in support, especially when it proves a credible military force by destroying the Death Star a few days later. In general, Tarkin's beliefs were steeped in the idea that as long as you were negotiating from a position of power (which the Empire was), you could do pretty much whatever you wanted and nobody would even try to stop you... an idea that could only exist if the Death Star were truly indestructible. Which it wasn't.

<ul><li> The Forsaken pretty much ran the areas they were in charge of during the Age of Legend into the ground because the only thing they were capable of doing was fighting. Asmodean, a relatively weak Aes Sedai, was made one of them because he only did things like kill all of his musical rivals, instead of feeding everyone to trollocs. When they were released from their prison, they didn't do much better. Most of the times they are seen holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> because they don't seem to understand that they can hold off on being evil for one day.

There are implications that they were picked by the Dark One <em>precisely</em> for being people with huge issues.

They spend slightly less time committing evil than their Forsaken masters, but only because they're too busy dying like flies. If they're not being ordered off into suicide missions or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">being executed for failing other impossible tasks</a>, they're being stabbed in the back by their rivals or casually tortured and killed just for being in the wrong place when somebody important has a temper tantrum. And to add to the Stupid Evil of it, they all earnestly believe that they'll get the immortality and infinite power they were promised even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a> hasn't given that to anyone in over three thousand years.
</li><li> Jordan himself noted that much of the Forsaken's behavior and group dynamics are based on Nazi internal politics, a group notorious for being really good at out-backstabbing one another and not so good at running things. Of the Forsaken, only Ishamael cum Moridin has a deeper, more philosophical understanding of the nature of oblivion and the Dark One's seeming true goals; arguably, he is the most dangerous because he isn't selfishly evil and is much more deeply nihilistic. Also worth noting is that most of the Forsaken mentioned above got killed off fairly early in the series, the handful who remain by the last book include some of the most dangerous villains in the series, most obviously Demandred<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ueip');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ueip" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ueip');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who carries the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a> solely because of his obsessive hatred of Lews Therin, not because he's in any way stupid, and still manages to wreck the good guys while juggling the thing</span> and Graendal.

He keeps up the good work by getting most of the Seven Kingdoms to agree to just end him for the gratuitously over-the-top <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> he later commits at Saltpans, pseudonym or not. To manage to offend the very jaded sensibilities of Westeros takes acute dedication to Evil and/or just plain idiocy.
</li><li> Historically, a fair few kings, lords, and Hands proved to be this and do get called out for it in the books by other characters. Here are a few highlights: Maegor "the Cruel" focused so much on being... well... cruel, that he wound up getting eviscerated by the Iron Throne <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoMurderedTheAsshole">under mysterious circumstances.</a> Then there's Aegon "the Unworthy": the Blackfyre Rebellions that rolled through Westeros and Essos for over 80 years of slaughter were, basically, entirely his fault. Just because he hated his siblings (one of whom was his wife), hated his son, hated hard work, and jumped into any bed or plate of food he could fit into his itinerary or mouth. Aerys "the Mad" grew so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMakeover">slovenly</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParanoiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParanoiac">jumpily paranoid</a> that one of his own Kingsguard took it upon himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">put the poor, deranged, mess of a man out of everybody's misery</a> during the civil war he helped cause.
</li><li> The Ironborn show shades of this as well. A culture that prides itself on pillaging and raiding, they have little plans other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>, thus leaving them underprepared for anything else. Theon Greyjoy, for example, manages to take Winterfell in a sneak attack but forgets to realize that in order to hold it from being retaken, he needs men, hundreds at least, and he only has a few dozen. He has the added problem of not understanding that the whole point of Ironborn tactics is <em>raiding</em>; if he'd taken prisoners, looted the place, and skedaddled like his crew advised, it would have been a flawless victory.

(To make this even more absurd, the town in question is <em>in the middle of the desert</em>.)

This ritual is basically a brutal instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">Make an Example of Them</a>, as the games were set up in response to a failed rebellion against the Capitol. However, by the end of the first book, the Capitol have clearly mismanaged things, and President Snow rightly fears that another rebellion may be simmering. In response, he visits Katniss and implores her to keep the peace, and that's the smart decision. The stupid part is when he simultaneously initiates a violent crackdown against the Districts, and people are brutally and publicly punished and executed for showing any sort of dissidence against the Capitol. Given that Katniss is out touring the Districts while this happens, the people get a convenient figurehead to rally behind.

</div></li><li> Nikolai Carpathia of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> series shows some hysterically poor planning, considering he's supposed to be both a mastermind and the Antichrist. His entire plan to win out over God basically boils down to following a prophecy that is guaranteed to lead to his defeat to the letter, then deviating from it and trying to shoot Jesus at the very last possible second. The only reason Carpathia even succeeds as much as he does is that everyone else on earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">is an even bigger idiot than he is</a>.
</li><li> Evil Harry Dread from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero">The Last Hero</a></em> is one of these, and indeed all true "Dark Lords" are, as part of an ancient covenant with the heroes. Actually, he is a deconstruction of the trope, as he KNOWS what the stupid decisions will lead to, but makes the mistakes anyways out of a sense of honor. He also does it so that the heroes will make similarly stupid mistakes (out of a similar sense of honor) that let him get away, among other things. We're also told that this is the <em>reason</em> he's the last Dark Lord; modern heroes that don't follow the old Code are much more pragmatic, take precautions like blocking villain escape routes, and just kill them off when they have the chance.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> series offers several examples:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">the first book</a>, Rabban brutally mistreats the Fremen at every opportunity with very little provocation. Of course, unbeknownst to him, his uncle, the Baron Harkonnen, is deliberately letting Rabban abuse his power so that he can eventually be deposed by his brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Feyd</a>, with the expectation that Feyd will be hailed as a savior. Unfortunately for Harkonnen, Feyd is also prone to stupid evil — he tries to have the Baron killed before the plot has played out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfDune">Children of Dune</a></em>, Wensicia tries to have Leto and Ghanima — a pair of nine-year-old twins with genius-level intellects and the collected military experience of all their ancestors combined — killed with <em>tigers</em> (sure, they're specially trained and have little devices in their brains that allow them to be remotely controlled, but they'll still dumb animals against genius kids). And she sets this plan into motion for no other reason than petty revenge for the overthrow of her father — since the kids have not yet ascended the throne, their deaths won't actually bring down House Atreides or the Cult of Muad'Dib. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The plan fails, of course, and her own son is so disgusted by her stupidity that he forces her to give up her power and then has her exiled.</span>

Cyrgon's a god of stagnation, and despises change and innovation, causing his people to idolise stupidity and execute anybody intelligent. Cyrgon himself refuses to admit the world has changed, confusing Trolls for Dawn-Men and arming himself and his people with bronze instead of iron or steel. That said, when push comes to shove, he's not actually deficient in IQ, and when he finds himself in a life-or-death situation against Sparhawk, he proves himself capable of innovating.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGapCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGapCycle">The Gap Cycle</a></em>, Angus Thermopyle is so stupid and evil that it's a wonder that he's had any success as a pirate. Nowhere is this more aptly demonstrated than when he kidnaps Morn Hyland and fixes her with a zone implant, intending to force her to do labor on his ship, but then keeps rendering her useless by repeatedly beating and raping her so that she's too injured to work.

The things and people he liked best as a human live the longest, but that just means that their misery is prolonged. He claims that he's merely destroying a flawed creation so that he can build a better one in its place, but it's pretty clear that "creation" isn't really in his divine wheelhouse and he will ultimately wind up alone in the universe with only his self-loathing for company.

<ul><li> One of his earliest such moments is in <em>By Schism Rent Asunder</em>, ordering his Inquisitors to turn what was <em>intended</em> to be a seizure of Charisian shipping on one of their ports into a bloodbath later known as the Ferayd Massacre. He goes on to lie to his three fellow members of the Group of Four about how the massacre began, so they're blindsided and forced to acknowledge they were in the wrong when Charis sends the Temple proof of what really happened.
</li><li> <em>How Firm a Foundation:</em> His long-standing automatic suspicion of the Republic of Siddarmark prompts him to instigate the Sword of Schueler, a plan that starts unrest within the country quickly turning into outright civil war and nearly destroying the Republic from the inside out. He does this despite being told repeatedly by the others in the Group of Four to leave Siddarmark alone, since they still give tithes and are, at worst, neutral in the conflict. After the Sword of Schueler, Siddarmark's leaders ally with Charis just to survive and provides the naval-based Charis with a mainland ally it desperately needed.
</li><li> In <em>Hell's Foundations Quiver</em>, during the overland war in Siddarmark, he refuses to allow troops of the Army of God to be pulled back, despite the advice of the army's supreme commander. One reason is that he refuses to give up ground won from the heretics. However, that captured land also contains numerous concentration camps that are used to sort through captured heretics that he does not want to see liberated.

He wants <em>everyone</em> to be miserable, and he includes himself in that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a>,</em> Brokenstar forces young kits to start training as apprentices when they are three months old (around age <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">five</a></em> in cat years) instead of the standard six (age 10 in cat years), which leads to them dying in battle because they're not old enough to fight properly. When all of ShadowClan's kits are dead, instead of doing the smart thing and changing his tactics, Brokenstar decides to refill the nursery by kidnapping kits from other Clans, which predictably pisses them off. By then, he has become so hated by his own Clan that they not only help ThunderClan recover their missing kits but team up with them to drive Brokenstar out of ShadowClan for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy">The Han Solo Trilogy</a></em>: The Empire during the events of the books as it becomes increasingly repressive. As Han reflects, tax people to death paying for your war machine, then you massacre them just for peacefully protesting this, and naturally many will find armed revolt is the only option (plus Imperial officers that retain a conscience will defect).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadesOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadesOfMagic">Shades of Magic</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Veskan twins</span> in the third book try to break a century-old peace treaty, assassinate the royal family of Red London, and stage an invasion, all while Red London is desperately trying to hold off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that destroyed the world of Black London and is trying to do the same to their world. For bonus Stupid Evil points, the invading army's presence would actually feed the entity and make it stronger.
</li><li> In Saint Augustine's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Confessions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Confessions">Confessions</a></em>, he argues from his personal experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">that real evil people can be this trope</a>. As a boy, he stole pears from a neighbour's tree: what he liked was not the taste of the pears themselves, or the feeling of sating hunger, or any other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">façade of logic</a> that humans have invented to justify their sins, but the psychologically masochistic knowledge that he was corrupting himself more and more every time he did it. Augustine concludes that sin itself was desirable, solely because it was sin. Yet even sin's pleasurable nature did not justify the importance he assigned it, because the love and awe of God is <em>more</em> pleasurable, and Augustine is happy to have been converted to it... Basically, Stupid Evil is realistic because people being stupid is realistic. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">truly smart person</a> wouldn't commit sin in the first place.

S. Lewis</a> wanted to make the point that, having renounced the source of all good, Satan has to renounce all good things, intelligence being one of them. Ransom comes to the realization that for demons, intelligence is a trait that they can put on or remove at will  it's like clothes they wear rather than an innate characteristic. And based on the Un-Man's petty behavior whenever he isn't "working", it's clear he would rather be intelligent as little as possible.
</li><li> In <em>The May Night, or the Drowned Maiden</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiGogol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiGogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> disguises herself by turning into one of the rusalki and stealthily continues to plague her stepdaughter's posthumous existence. Seems very cunning, but <em>then</em> she gives herself away in the most idiotic manner possible  by <em>volunteering</em> to play the villain in a game and obviously reveling in doing so. However, since it takes a living man to realize it, while the stepdaughter remains clueless, probably rusalki arent too clever in general.

</li><li> The Master in his first season has this as a character trait. Most of his stories involve the Doctor pointing out to him that if his own plan succeeds, he's doomed — usually due to basic logical oversights like not considering the fact that he's trying to blow up the planet he's currently living on and can't leave, or that the villains have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>, or that the telepathic death machine has no way of not killing him too, and so on — and the Master panicking and agreeing to help the Doctor fix his own mess.

This rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">pathetic</a> characterisation is partly why the Hinchcliffe regime decided to drastically reinvent him as a psychotic, murderous, and genuinely hateful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">lich-like creature</a>.

<ul><li> What makes Joffrey Baratheon so dangerous to everyone including himself is that he isn't just cruel, he's <em>stupid</em> and cruel. This starts with his execution of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ned Stark which triggers a war with the North</span>, leaving his regime vulnerable to Robert's brothers, who want to usurp his rule (and they quickly put on an appearance) when the smart thing to do (and what Cersei and others wanted) would have been to keep Ned alive and negotiate a truce or alliance with the North. In a world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a> practicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a>, no-one's very impressed with him engaging in pointlessly evil acts just for the sake of being a bastard heedless of the consequences. He's compared <em>negatively</em> to the Mad King at a few points. It reaches a peak in "The Old Gods and the New" when Joffrey triggers a riot in King's Landing by ordering the crowd of starving smallfolk <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">put to death because one of them threw cow dung at him</a></em>, as per the novel. His uncle Tyrion does not hesitate to express his distaste when he all but invokes the trope by name with this splendid description:
<div class="indent"><strong>Tyrion</strong>: We've had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">vicious kings</a>, and we've had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">idiot kings</a>, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">vicious idiot</a></em> for a king!
</div></li><li> It must be genetic because Cersei (and Jaime, to a slightly lesser extent) tend to default to killing people and pissing people off even when it blatantly conflicts with their interests, something which Tywin and Tyrion separately note about Cersei. Both Cersei and Jaime suffer from no one particularly liking them, and neither seems to understand the true reasons why. It gets to the point where Tywin is quick to empower his much-disparaged son Tyrion to mitigate Cersei's calamities. Cersei related examples:
<ul><li> She cares nothing about public sentiment and doesn't realize that throwing people out of her city will draw their ire and how the ire of the mob is dangerous for kings and queens.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Listen to me, "queen regent". You're in danger of losing the people. <br/><strong>Cersei:</strong> The people? Heh. You think I care? <br/><strong>Tyrion:</strong> You may find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.
</div></li><li> Her understanding on the actual military threats posed by Stannis Baratheon and Robb Stark is likewise tenuous at best, to the point that Tyrion's victory at Blackwater is almost in spite of her efforts, rather than because of it (her only contribution is getting the wildfire made, a plan Tyrion co-opted because she likely would have burned King's Landing to the ground by accident). Of course, a lot of these may be due to her rapidly becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk">not very functioning addict</a>.
</li><li> Once the sensible influences or restraints of Tyrion and Tywin are gone, Cersei goes one step further and engages in one petty, short-sighted scheme after another, culminating in her empowering the Faith Militant as a petty revenge scheme against the Tyrells with zero regards for the potential blowback. She's called out on this one multiple times.
</li><li> She takes it another step further when she decides to gather all of her enemies at the same time at the Great Sept of Baelor with what was supposed to be her trial, and has the building blown up, killing Kevan Lannister, Margaery, Loras, and Mace Tyrell, the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant, and heavens know how many people, leaving her alone with Tommen in the political arena of King's Landing. She then happily skips off to torture the septa who beat her and mouthed off to her... leaving a despairing Tommen, knowing that his mother was responsible for the blast that killed his wife, family and countless people, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">take a leap off a very high window</a>.
</li><li> Cersei takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the Season 7 finale. She lies about joining Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Army of the Dead</a>, saying she'll let the two sides weaken each other and then finish off the winner. Jaime incredulously points out if they don't help, they'll die. Either the dead win, absorbing Jon and Daenerys's armies into their ranks before attacking them, or Jon and Daenerys win and take their revenge on them for not helping, and Daenerys's forces are already more powerful than Cersei's. When Cersei refuses to budge, Jaime gets fed up and abandons her to join Jon and Daenerys.
</li><li> Cersei finally does the absolutely stupidest thing she could do in the last two episodes of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing one of Daenerys's dragons and personally executing Dany's best friend right in front of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">just to see her suffer</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Ramsay stands out as being incapable of restraining his sadism at great cost to his cause, though unlike Joffrey, he <em>is</em> intelligent and street-wise when he needs to be. The problem is that he mainly uses his intelligence to devise ways to torture and torment people for kicks, often without considering the long-term consequences of his cruel acts.
<ul><li> When Roose returns to the Dreadfort, he's quick to chastise Ramsay for how he's managed to destroy any chance of making a badly needed alliance with the Greyjoys just because he wanted to have a bit of pointless fun breaking a man.
</li><li> Ramsay then needlessly massacres the Greyjoy garrison at Moat Cailin, flaying them alive and publicly displaying their corpses... after they had <em>surrendered in good faith</em> on the promise of safe passage!
</li><li> This is pushed to new heights in Season 5 after Ramsay gets cocky from being legitimized as "Ramsay Bolton". Everyone (from Jon Snow in the Night's Watch to Stannis to the Small Council in King's Landing) is starting to get concerned that winter is finally coming in a matter of weeks, and to worry about food supplies. Ramsay, in contrast, is messily enjoying a private feast for himself — animals he should have kept alive for the winter.
</li><li> When Lord Cerwyn (one of the top dozen lords in the North) refuses to acknowledge the Boltons as the new rulers of the North, Ramsay publicly flays him alive - along with his brother <em>and</em> his wife — while forcing Cerwyn's son to watch. Ramsay is outright proud that afterwards, the son paid his taxes. Ramsay barely listens as his father tries to explain to him that such wanton brutality hurts them in the long term — instead, he continues to shove food in his mouth. Roose then gets so annoyed at Ramsay's oblivious stupidity that he comes the closest he ever has in the entire TV series to outright <em>shouting</em> at someone. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3nwlj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3nwlj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3nwlj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the books, Ramsay actually got that feast from House Stout; their lord begged Ramsay that they had already slaughtered all of their animals at harvest time for winter, and all they have left are their breeding stock: he pleads that if Ramsay has him slaughter his <em>breeding stock</em>, he won't have any way of replenishing his herds at all and won't be able to provide Ramsay <em>or himself</em> meat again a year from now. Ramsay utterly ignores his warning and demands that he slaughter his breeding stock anyway. Ramsay isn't just eating up provisions, he is <em>destroying his means of production</em>. This quote from <em>28 Days Later</em> comes to mind: "He's telling me he'll never bake bread, plant crops, raise livestock: He's telling me he's futureless."</span>
</li><li> In Season 6, his father coldly points out that "playing his games" with Sansa, i.e. raping and torturing her repeatedly and causing her to run away, may well have cost him the support of the North. Without Sansa, the Boltons have no hold over the Northern lords. In the following episode, Ramsay correctly surmises that Sansa is running away to her brother Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at Castle Black, and suggests they wage war against Castle Black to reclaim his bride. However, Roose believes the Northern lords would rise up against him for murdering the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
</li><li> All of this comes to a head in "Battle of the Bastards". He uses his own men as a trap in the titular Battle of the Bastards, discounting the possibility of reinforcements and ending up killing his entire Karstark-Umber-Bolton alliance more or less to a man. When finally cornered inside Winterfell, he at least has one chance to kill the enemy leader while surrounded but wastes it by finishing off the giant Wun Wun (who was going to die anyway) instead of killing Jon when he is distracted. His actions have left House Bolton with no heirs, dooming it to be forgotten by history as the Starks retake Winterfell and he is fed to his own dogs.
</li></ul></li><li> Gregor Clegane, aka the Mountain, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, but he's so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> that he has virtually no impulse control or strategic thought and will simply lash out at anyone who irritates him, and, given his massive strength, usually kills them. He's really only alive because almost no-one is willing to take him on, and Tywin Lannister protects him from the people who are, and even Tywin is getting tired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">of his liability</a>.
<ul><li> Lord Tywin reproaches the Mountain for wasting able-bodied prisoners by torturing them to death.
</li><li> In his first appearance, Gregor tries to straight-up murder a son of one of the Great Houses of Westeros in front of the King.

That was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a>, but as long as he kept his mouth shut, Doran Martell could justify not starting a conflict with the crown.

</li></ul></li><li> Viserys Targaryen. Provoking his superiors is not a wise idea.
</li><li> House Greyjoy tend to attack whenever they think they can gain anything from it, even if they can't actually hold onto it because they aren't very effective on land against trained soldiers. If you have other enemies to deal with this can actually make them dangerous to be around because though they may be doomed to fail and are too short-sighted to be initially reasoned with they could still end up taking you down with them in the process.
<ul><li> Evident from Balon's very first appearance. Balon always does the stupidest, most evil thing he can think of. He could have joined the Starks (as Theon advises) <em>or</em> (probably, since they were still nominally loyal to the Iron Throne before attacking the North) the Lannisters and achieve his objectives of independence for the Iron Isles  but his insistence on acting independently means his uprising is doomed to failure once the War of the Five Kings is resolved. Then again, given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>, few people would be prepared to deal with him anyway.
</li><li> Theon displays poor leadership and favours unnecessary violence. He's shortsighted and doesn't seem to grasp the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a>, being more interested in seeming tough. Luwin is unable to convince him that Ser Rodrick is more valuable alive than dead, and Theon repeats this mistake again with the Stark boys, as Yara points out. A rare example in which his Stupid Evil comes from trying to <em>adhere</em> to PR where the Ironborn are concerned. The worst part is that he's stupid from an Ironborn perspective too; he understands the "hit hard and fast" part of their way of war, but refuses to do the "take the loot and captives and run" part. The result is that his masterful raid on Winterfell with a handful of men rapidly degenerates into an insane attempt to <em>hold</em> it with a handful of men, who promptly abandon him at the first opportunity.

The question is why? The duke had the power of the Dark One at his disposal, which is later shown to be <em>more</em> than enough to drive back the ogres (as Rumpelstiltskin did). There were plenty of adults around, so why pointlessly throw away children in the war? It seems that the only reason to squander that magical power <em>and</em> get children killed for no point or purpose was to get Baelfire involved so that Rumpelstiltskin would have a reason to grow a backbone and kick off his character arc. Or, being a feudal lord, as a way to keep the peasant population in check. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Some fans theorise that the Ogres didn't even start the war and that the Duke keeps the war in the current unwinnable state in order to justify exorbitant taxes and martial law.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> Reacher Gilt is this in the TV adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>. Having taken the clacks system away from the Dearheart family thanks only to the happy coincidence of Moist Von Lipwig's bank fraud, which ruined the family enough that they were forced to sell the clacks, he basically runs it into the ground, allowing the towers to break down, treating the employees like shit, and making business decisions based solely on what will profit him the most in the short term. And when he's actually forced to compete with someone, he automatically resorts to criminality. After Vetinari decides to force Moist Von Lipwig to resurrect the post office, Gilt responds by hiring a banshee to try and kill Lipwig and burn down the post office. When Lipwig manages to keep the postal service running anyway, Gilt hires bandits to intercept the carriages. It never seems to occur to him that the clacks could have easily crushed the postal service if he'd actually bothered to maintain and improve the towers. This is a particularly regrettable case of this given his characterization in the book, where he is a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> who is suggested to have little liquid wealth and is simply <em>extremely</em> savvy with financial tricks and showmanship. In the book, it is explained that he is fully aware that the clacks are nearly unusable (and are constantly getting worse), but he is still making a fortune from them, and when they (inevitably) completely fail, he will make an even larger fortune by selling them, <em>regardless of their condition</em>, making his cheapskate management a solid case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a> (and he is implied to have done this to other businesses in the past).

One year before the start of the series, he held a group of people hostage in a warehouse until Gideon was able to talk him down; Bale gave himself up but held on to the remote for his bomb, and detonated it when six FBI agents went in to do a sweep, ensuring he was imprisoned for life and destroying any chance of parole. In Season 1, he was called in to advise the BAU on how to disarm a necklace bomb on a hostage that was copied from one of his designs — in exchange, he managed to negotiate a transfer to a secure hospital and forces Gideon to make a written statement that Bale was smarter than him. When it came down to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">Wire Dilemma</a>, he lied about which wire to cut (fortunately, Gideon didn't believe him), invalidating his deal and getting himself put back in prison, now branded as a snitch.

Yeah, how's that a good idea?
</li><li> Orthodox Christianity states that sin (i.e. acting against God's love and His will) is <em>inherently</em> stupid (basically Evil Is Dumb). It brings His wrath upon you, totally ruins your soul, mind, and body, <em>makes you want to sin more</em>, and eventually, brings you to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>. (Not to mention that <em>the whole universe</em> has changed for the worse after Adam and Eve's first sin.) In fact, the only reason that we <em>exist</em> now, according to saints, is that He wants us to repent (feel guilt, ask God for forgiveness and stop sinning, and live by His Commandments (Old and New Testaments)). At the same time, however, it recognizes the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a> (killing in wars while protecting your country, for example). It's <em>still</em> a sin, and should be avoided and repented if committed, but it's allowed. It also makes an above-mentioned statement about Satan even more outlined.
</li><li> Zoroastrianism argues that evil is self-defeating because it is inherently stupid. This is why Angra Mainyu is fated to lose compared to the intelligent Ahura Mazda, and indeed in mythology, most of his "plans" (read: spiteful decisions) backfire horribly one way or the other.

This is because he has a tendency to slaughter friend and foe alike when his blood is up. At one point, when the World Eaters (Kharn's legion of Chaos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a>) were attacking an enemy force of Emperor's Children (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">another Legion of Chaos Space Marines</a>), a blizzard so terrible even the genetically-enhanced and daemonically-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> couldn't take it descended and forced both sides to retreat into shelter. In a fit of rage, Kharn <em>burned shelters to the ground</em> and proceeded to run around in a psychotic frenzy, slaughtering anyone that came within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">chainsaw-axe</a> range. Both Legions had to kill their own battle brothers to get inside the shelters and survive, and as a result, they were never again able to take the field as a unified fighting force, and are now reduced to fighting alongside other Chaos warbands as shock troops. This is represented in the tabletop game by Kharn's special rules: if you roll poorly to hit in close combat, where any other character would simply miss, Kharn instead <em>hits someone on his own side</em>. Though he does have a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justification</a>; Kharn is fanatically dedicated to Khorne, the Blood God, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Khorne cares not from where the blood flows,</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithYourCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithYourCarnage">so long as it flows</a></em>.

</li><li> Diverting shock troops in extremely rare and strong armor, even by Space Marine standards, from a strategically important battle to take out an enemy propaganda station run by a dozen unarmed monks, then annihilating it from orbit while the shock troops are still inside. Chaos commanders seem to have a collective inferiority complex or something.
</li></ul></li><li> The Imperium of Man suffers heavily from this; half the time, it seems like it's done to keep them from completely wiping out the Chaos Marines. Acts done by the Inquisition are the worst case; they don't shy away from committing acts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a> but are infamous for doing things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">leveling whole planets just because a few people came into contact with alien technology</a>.

</li><li> Orks are done this way on purpose. They pick a fight with anything they meet, including each other if there's nothing else around. But for them, it's part of their appeal, and the fact that they basically reproduce by dying helps cover for their stupidity. The Orks' inability to stop infighting is actually a justification for why there is a setting at all: If the orks, in all their unfathomable numbers, didn't like killing each other as much as everything else and actually managed to work together long enough, <em>nothing in the universe would be able to stop them.</em> Downplayed in that Orks are not really evil so much as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a>: for them, war and violence are nothing more than fun pastimes.

They will lie, mislead, manipulate, and be jerks just to show off their superiority.

Neither of them wants to actually destroy the world. Heck, Belkar is an Evil halfling and he's like 70% towards wanting to save it. You need to have some kind of underlying <em>reason</em> to support this scheme!
</div></li><li> Later subverted when it turns out he does have a reason. When the world is destroyed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the souls of all the dwarfs in the world will belong to Hel, which will grant her the power to remake the world as she sees fit, with the High Priest presumably having a favored position at her right hand.</span>
</li><li> Nale. Compulsively boastful of his evil deeds, arrogant, power-hungry, but often doesn't think through the consequences of his actions. He once killed 417 people just to give local law enforcement an obvious clue as to where he was hiding out at (the map of the killings formed an arrow). However, his arrogance came back to bite him, hard, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he plotted and executed the killing of his father's friend Malack, then boasted of it to his father, who then killed Nale and avenged Malack.</span>

He also thinks that every bot should bow down to him because he's in charge (or he thinks he should be), even if those bots tend to be twice his size and strength.
</li><li> Airachnid. Whilst dangerous, her ambitions far exceed her capabilities, something that even <em>Starscream</em> manages to keep some check over.

When Megatron starts fighting back and winning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">she panics</a>.

This leads to Starscream's disobedience often making him into a hindrance; in the pilot, the Autobots wake up because Starscream shoots at their ship, and an Autobot sneaking on the Decepticon ship is aided by Starscream trying to kill Megatron.
</li><li> Galvatron in the show's third season is even worse, thanks to his violent outbursts that lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">attacking his own men for no reason</a>. Of course, he <em>did</em> end up immersed in lava for quite some time after the movie (in which he was fairly competent), and it's pointed out that it didn't do his processors any favors. It's shown that, crazy though he is, he's basically the only leader the Decepticons have by that point with enough charisma and fighting skills to actually keep them together—but even his most loyal servant, Cyclonus, still tried to send him in for psychiatric treatment.

A stand-out example is when he makes a bet with Kyle to make a song that goes platinum. Cartman does a shameless ripoff of a Christian song that becomes a huge hit, but at the end of the episode learns that his song is a type of music that can't get a platinum award. While sales for the song could still make Cartman lots of money, because he was only thinking about his bet with Kyle, Cartman throws a fit and shows what a jerk he is to his Christian audience, costing him his entire fanbase and earning him a well-deserved red-ass beatdown from Token.

Tad, being an 80s rival character, decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">sabotage Stan to ensure a win</a>... only Tad is an experienced skier while Stan is nine years old and just learned how to ski that weekend. When Tad gets ahead, he spends several minutes setting up traps (cutting down a tree, laying sawdust) meant to slow Stan down, but Stan is so slow already that the traps don't even change his speed any. This also gives time for Tad himself to get sabotaged and lose. He is also so determined to bully Stan into a challenge that he doesn't acknowledge the fact Stan is constantly telling him he doesn't care about the whole thing and wants to be left alone and if he did, he would be the winner of the competition by default.

Burns does try to rationalize this scheme by pointing out that by denying the people of Springfield solar energy, he'd have a monopoly on energy sources (he's already purchased every oil rig in town) and force everyone to purchase nuclear power, but it's likely that all his potential customers would be so disgusted (or just so creeped out at living under permanent darkness) that they'd just move to another town. At one point, in the midst of gloating about how he has succeeded in bringing the town to heel and ruined many lives, he sees a baby with a piece of candy in a park across town and he decides to drop everything and go get that piece of candy, forcing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Smithers</a> to make him focus (this act turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> for the event that gets Burns shot, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is that he decides, in the middle of his gloating about blocking the sun, to steal Maggie's candy, which he has to struggle to perform because he's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyWeak">Laughably Weak</a>, which leads to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFireGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFireGuns">an accidental discharge</a> of Burns' gun</span>).

Him's final attempt is to brainwash two scientists into using a device that starts to move the Earth into the sun. Mojo quickly launches into a tirade about how <em>stupid</em> that is (for obvious reasons). This is a subversion because Him was bluffing. After letting Mojo speak his mind, he simply waves his hand, and it stops. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">For all we know</a>, he <em>wanted</em> Mojo to embarrass himself.)

She was on cloud nine and Townsville was in a crisis — until someone robbed her father's mansion. Robbed him <em>blind</em>. (Didn't count on your house, which everyone knew was owned by a millionaire, being robbed once you made crime legal, did you, Princess?) With the three heroines unable to help her because of her own ill-conceived law, she was quick to revoke it, and then <em>they</em> were quick to round up every criminal in the act of breaking the law. But they didn't recover her property, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">mainly because they were the ones who had robbed her.</a> Once the Girls politely explain that you can't be held legally responsible for committing a crime if the "crime" is an act committed before a law officially made it illegal, the Girls are able to "convince" her to relinquish the town back to the mayor. Even worse, for Princess, it's implied that she's still punished by her father for what happened. (Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">in retrospect</a>, she had no idea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge">what might have happened in such a situation...</a>)
</li><li> Thanks to a deal made by the Powerpuff Girls, Mojo Jojo is allowed to wreak havoc across Townsville over and over with the Girls being allowed to eat 1 candy for each crime they stopped. Yet for no reason aside to be a dick, Mojo decides to betray them by stealing the Mayor's candy just because he finds it more fun than destroying Townsville despite the fact that they are the reason he even managed to get out of prison every time. Unsurprisingly, this leads to Mojo getting the worst beating of his life, and the girls would have even <em>killed</em> him if Blossom hadn't realized what they were doing.

<ul><li> Notably general Typhonus, whose irrational evil stupidity and bad timing have actually benefited his enemies more than anything. At one point, sent by Phaeton to sabotage any deal between Exofleet and the Pirate clans to unite them, but his betrayal of the pirate clans and kidnapping of their leader only serve to unite the factions into a new powerful force against his species.
</li><li> One Neo-Sapien human collaborator betrays his fellow operatives and allies for the sake of currency. Considering their now revealed plans to enslave humanity or genocide, it's pretty stupid. The Stupid Evil is enhanced when you realize that he has no way to even use the money he's being paid with!
</li><li> Despite the fact the Neosapiens plan on wiping out the enemy human fleets such as the pirate clans or Exosquad. One Pirate Clan leader still betrays the entire clans, sabotages their fleets, and tries to cause infighting just so he could get in power. His actions get him killed though he was fairly successful as a spy otherwise. Strangely, the Neosapiens recruited him but never seemed to support him with anything other than angry forceful orders, so why did he even work for them when he could've gained leadership through his regular non-traitorous means?
</li><li> Despite Phaeton clearly going insane, and eventually plotting to blow up planet earth along with the majority of the remaining Neosapians. Several still serve him unquestionably. Some even bathe in villainous excitement of the plans despite the fact everyone would be dead and their species nearly extinct.
</li><li> Subverted in most of the series, notably one scene where Phaeton continually questions Marsala's switching sides, constantly providing him with tests of loyalty, even nearly turning one ally into a vegetable during interrogation, on top of capturing the rest of the squad and beating up an ally. Even that wasn't enough as Phaeton orders Marsala to kill his allies. Marsala is given a gun and in the last minute finally proves his actual loyalties. Most other villains would have been stupidly evil and accepted his faked betrayal in an instant.

In general, much of Cedric's plans revolve taking Sofia's amulet, which he plans to use to rule the kingdom. But this amulet gives its wearer gifts or curses depending on behavior. And Cedric <em>knows</em> this, but doesn't seem worried about the possibility of getting cursed if he ever got the amulet. And in one memorable instance, as part of a scheme to take the amulet in the pilot, Cedric casts a spell that puts everyone in the ballroom to sleep. That would be a brilliant plan, if not for him deciding to cast this spell while he's in the ballroom himself, so he falls asleep like everyone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:

This ended up biting him because his weakened body left Bill unable to chase after Mabel, who has the journal in her own hand.
</li><li> Despite the fact that the Northwests simply need to open the mansion gates to break the lumberjack's curse that was placed upon them when they went back on their promise of giving the commoners a grand party as thanks for building said mansion, they absolutely refused to do so simply because they do not want to associate with the "common rabble" in spite of the fact that they are greatly endangering the lives of everyone (including themselves) by doing so. In fact, had Preston successfully convinced Pacifica to hide in the bunker in order to prevent her from fulfilling the 150-year-old promise, his mansion would have been burnt down and with it, all the rich folks, politicians, and celebrities invited, forever destroying his dignity and the reputation of the family name.

For a specific example, Rubilax manages to steal Sadlygrove's body and stumbles upon a way to release his kinsmen into the World of Ten. When he contacts King Rushu to explain, the other demons can't stop berating and belittling him, finally demanding he releases another Shushu and let HER take over the operation (something the other Shushu had been pushing for to get the glory for herself). They genuinely seem surprised when Rubilax gets fed up, cuts communication, and ends the plan. And of course, there's their generally violent behavior which led to the all but destroyed state of their own world.

To elaborate further, the dog he formerly owned is shown to be completely loyal to him and has been personally trained by Khyber himself to use the Nemetrix which works only on non-sentient beings, therefore, he has to waste all the time recruiting and training a new dog for his Nemetrix. Furthermore, Azmuth was also about to use it to track down and arrest Khyber and would have certainly get captured if it weren't for Malware's arrival.

Sadly (for Aku, anyway) the blade simply goes 'plink' against Jack's skin, leaving Aku so shocked that his eyeball flames poof out.

In that one and its variants, puzzle solvers are limited in the number of questions they can ask, and there is often a more conventional "Normal" character hidden among the Stupid Evil knaves, who can usually imitate a knight or knave whenever convenient.
</li><li> Many conspiracy theories portray the villains in question as this way, as they are said to do some nefarious deed even though it doesn't benefit them any (and, in many cases, would actively be detrimental towards them).
