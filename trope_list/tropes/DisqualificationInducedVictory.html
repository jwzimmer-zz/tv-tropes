</div></div><p>So you got your typical Underdog story. The protagonist tries to compete in a competition. Sadly, despite his best efforts, he ends up being juuust behind the winning competitors during the first round, and he seems to have lost. With his hopes crushed, he is about to go back home... but what's that? One of the winners is revealed to have been cheating! This results in their disqualification... Since this leaves an empty space among the winners, and the protagonist was the closest behind them, he manages to get in after all! That lucky bastard!

A less frequent variant involves the original winner being unable to compete due to sudden injury or sickness, allowing the protagonist to step in.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em>, Berserker defeated Caster in a tennis contest when Caster was distracted, yet he was disqualified for swinging too hard and hitting the wall, Illya even called him out for not understanding any rule.
</li><li> Subverted and played straight at the same time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. During the Tournament of Destroyers, after Frost eliminates both Goku and Piccolo, he is found out to have been using a weapon the whole time which is against the rules, disqualifying him and giving Piccolo the win. Goku is also allowed back into the tournament after Beerus finds proof that Frost used the weapon against him too. However, Vegeta insists on letting Frost's disqualification be revoked and Piccolo forfeit so that he gets a chance to fight Frost himself. Not only is this request given the okay, but Vegeta also allows Frost to use his weapon in their fight with no objections from Beerus or Champa.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Vegeta:</strong> I will not let this prideless bastard walk away on some technicality. He will leave because I have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">knocked! him! out!</a>
</div></li><li> In the Gunpla Artistic Cup at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry">Gundam Build Fighters Try</a></em>, everyone is expecting Minato to win... not without good reason, as it honestly does look like his "Super Fumina" model took a lot of skill to build. However, Yuuma and his Lightning Zeta Gundam are announced as the winners. When Minato demands an explanation, Meijin Kawaguchi explains that Minato had not received Fumina's permission to use her likeness (evident in her reaction of shock/embarrassment/horror when she saw the model), thus he was disqualified.
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>. In the sports festival, Ojiro, Shoda, and Aoyama advance to the third round due to Shinso brainwashing them into joining his team. While Shinso's strategy was allowable, Ojiro and Shoda back out because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">they won't accept a victory they didn't earn</a>. Midnight offers to allow team Kendo (made of Kendo, Tokage, Komori, and Yanagi) to send two of their members to replace them, as they were the next-place team, but they insist that team Tetsutetsu (made of Tetsutetsu, Shiozaki, Honenuki, and Awase) deserves the place more than they do (team Kendo was incapacitated halfway through the second round and only didn't lose all their points because Todoroki was moving too fast to grab all their headbands, whereas team Tetsutetsu was in third place until Shinso brainwashed them into giving him their points at the very end). Because of the six people ahead of them backing out, Tetsutetsu and Shiozaki advance to the third round.
</li><li> A similar situation to the above occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedLine">Red Line</a></em>, JP loses the qualification round for the titular Red Line race. However, when multiple qualifiers back out (due to the race being set on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>), JP qualifies due to popular vote.
</li><li> During the Cooking Fest arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em>, Setsuno reveals that this is how she won the first ever festival. She was the runner up, but the victor, Joie, was disqualified after it was discovered he had broken several rules.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, this happens to Team Togoro's Karasu posthumously. While Kurama was able to kill Karasu at the end of their match, he wasn't able to break the 10-count before it happened. The result is a ring-out disqualification for Kurama and the match victory going to Karasu.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone">Dr. Stone</a></em>: This is ultimately how Senku ends up winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> despite being one of the physically weakest contenders; his opponent passes out before the final round due to injuries received in previous fights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> Jounouchi/Joey both benefited from and fell victim to disqualifying victories during the Battle City Arc. His first finals battle against Rishid/Odion has both of them being knocked out by lighting summoned by Odion's fake Ra card, with Joey only winning because he wakes up first. Then, he actually technically wins his semi-finals duel with Marik, but passes out from the cumulative physical and psychic damage he endured during the match, before he can declare his winning move, causing Marik to be declared winner by default.

The proof is that they all have blue tongues because of the blue coloring Getafix added to the potion.
</li><li> Happened in one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comic</a> where Betty and Big Ethel compete against Veronica and Midge in beach volleyball game. Veronica has hired a scorekeeper, who unfairly calls several fouls on Betty's team, despite those girls playing well. The judge soon states he's ashamed to even give Veronica the trophy, soon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">Veronica belligerently starts yelling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveNoIdeaWhoYoureDealingWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveNoIdeaWhoYoureDealingWith">that she is the daughter of the head of Lodge Enterprises</a>. Then the judge states that her father's company is sponsoring the game and is therefore disqualified. Betty and Big Ethel win the game.

The newly-introduced Talbot, a werewolf, attends as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHalloweenIAmGoingAsMyself">a werewolf</a> while the human Derek goes as a zombie. Talbot wins the costume contest, but sees how crushed Derek is and claims he bought his "costume" at a store. He's disqualified and Derek is crowned the rightful winner.
</li><li> Dick Dastardly is the confirmed winner of the Scavenger Scramble (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em> #7, Gold Key) when Penelope Pitstop—who was first to the finish line—is disqualified for misinterpreting one of the items.

It gets to the point that during the relay run, he uses his Explosion Quirk to beat Midoriya to the finish line when he realizes he can't catch up to him just by running, but since Quirks aren't allowed during the competition, he's immediately disqualified and victory is awarded to Midoriya's team.

As a result, Lightning McQueen, who having understood a similar fate Doc Hudson went through when he was a racecar known as the Hudson Hornet, lets Chick cross the finish line first so he can help The King cross the finish line one last time. Chick is still given the Piston Cup, but because of both his dirty trick and Lightning's noble action, he is denied the Dinoco sponsorship, which is offered to Lightning instead, but he too turns it down in favor of learning the movie's moral.

The first game is a race where you have to avoid poisonous sea urchins. Mike and Sully run ahead of the rest of the team, cross the finish line, and at first it seems that they have won... but then they're informed that the <strong>entire</strong> team has to cross the finish line for it to count, and the rest of Oozma Kappa arrives last. Since each game ends with the worst team getting kicked out, it seems that all is lost... but then it's revealed that one of the teams used a gel that rendered them immune to the urchins, resulting in their disqualification. Hence, Oozma Kappa manages to move on to the next round after all.
</li><li> In Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Planes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Planes">Planes</a></em>, Dusty competes in a test race deciding which planes will get into the big "Wings Around the Globe" race. Dusty manages to get to the sixth place, just below the winner planes. He comes back home depressed, but a day or so later, a guy arrives to tell him that one of the winner planes was using an illegal fuel, and therefore Dusty got in after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SurfsUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SurfsUp">Surf's Up</a></em>, Chicken Joe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wins the surfing contest when antagonist Tank was attempting to push Chicken Joe in an attempt to wipe him out, but Cody interferes, causing both to enter the Boneyard, an out-of-bounds area for disqualification.</span>

However Arrow, determined to be chosen to be a Flyer, starts cheating by knocking some of the other competitors off course. He then taunts Rudolph by claiming that Zoey told him that she's only nice to Rudolph because she feels sorry for him, causing Rudolph's nose to light up and make Arrow and his elf driver crash into other competitors. Rudolph, along with his driver Doggle, wins the race, but is disqualified by the Elf Referee who saw what Rudolph's nose caused as cheating and makes Arrow winner instead much to the dismay of Rudolph's parents Blitzen and Mitzi, Zoey, Santa and Mrs. Claus.

</li><li> The film <em>Cannonball</em> sees one driver in the cross-country road race (the one in the Blazer) cheat by flying across the country. He claims victory, but can't find the bottle of champagne he planned to use to celebrate. His female companion says they must have left it on the plane.

Played with in that the final Golden Ticket was always waiting to be found; the "victory" was a result of finding the real ticket (as it was for the other four winners), not <em>because</em> someone was cheating.

In the final game, one of the players for Charlestown starts doing a striptease in the second period of the game. Seeing this, a Syracuse player beings yelling at the head referee in anger, eventually punching the ref. The ref disqualifies Syracuse and gives Charlestown the title. What makes this trope played with is that Charlestown probably could have won the game fairly, seeing as how there were at least two periods left to play- but where would the fun be in that?

However, each challenge has a set of parameters (usually blade length and width) that have to be adhered to avoid disqualification. So a bad quality blade that followed parameters will advance if one of the better quality blades did not follow parameters and was disqualified. If multiple blades are disqualified, a tiebreaker is used so only one person is eliminated each round. Blades can also be disqualified if during testing they have a 'catastrophic blade failure' ie. the blade breaks and it is unsafe to continue testing. In this situation the only thing that can save you from elimination is if another blade fails even worse. In one throwing knife challenge, a contestant had his knife break on the fifth throw. He was ready to leave the competition but then another contestant's blade broke after three throws. Then the last contestant's blade broke on the first throw and he was the one eliminated.

Although Scutter's Revenge broke down shortly after, the judges intervened after the battle and ruled that Pussycat was disqualified for the breach of health and safety regulaions, meaning Scutter's Revenge went through anyway.
</li><li> In the First World Championship, one of the American entrants, Mauler, was disqualified before it even got into the arena, because the producers realised too late that the British arena was not built for its flailing weapon and there was no way to contain it safely.

This atracted a lot of controversy, with accusations that at least two previous winning teams had also fielded ineligible players <em>and the producers had known this at the time</em>, that the rules were ambiguous at best, and that the player involved had questioned his <em>own</em> eligibility only for the producers to decide it was fine before changing their mind after the show aired. Even the Manchester team came out in support of their rivals, saying it was all a fuss over nothing and Corpus Christi's win should stand. Nevertheless the official record shows Manchester as champions for that series, giving them the joint record for most titles with four.

However because she wasn't properly registered as a teammate, the head coach of the other team contests it and unfortunately the judges, while impressed at Sam's ability, are forced to disqualify her team and give the victory to their opponents.

Averted for the 1999-2005 Tours, where <em>no</em> riders were awarded the win in place of the disqualified Lance Armstrong, as almost all the top cyclists were doping at the time.

</li><li> There are multiple cases in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Little League World Series</a> of teams being posthumously stripped of any wins and titles they earned because it was discovered afterwards that one or more players on the team were ineligible (either too old or living outside the proscribed geographic area). This has included forfeiting regional titles (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Little_League_World_Series">2001<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), US titles (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Little_League_World_Series">2014<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), and World Series titles (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Little_League_World_Series">1992<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
</li><li> A frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> occurrence. Individuals or teams found to have cheated can be stripped of their medal or placement, moving whoever was behind them up to their place, no matter how long ago the fraud occurred.
<ul><li> One of the most famous examples in the 100 meter finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson and American sprinter Carl Lewis were bitter rivals and the top two contenders to win the gold medal. During the race Ben Johnson won the gold medal, beating his rival for the first time, but 24 hours later, he tested positive for performace enhancing drugs. He was immediaty stripped of his gold medal and Lewis who finished second got the gold in his place. What makes this case still debated to this day, however, is that future investigations revealed 80 percent of athletes at the Seoul Olympics, with most being from Track and Field, tested positive for steroids, including Carl Lewis, but their test were cleared and only Ben Johnson was not cleared, which many found suspicious.
</li><li> In 2010, the US women's Olympic gymnastics team from 2000 was awarded the bronze medal from those Olympics after it was discovered that one of the gymnasts on the third-place Chinese team was underage.
</li><li> In a more controversial case, Andreea Raducan, the original winner of the 2000 women's gymnastics individual all-around, was disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance, even though she did not take it knowingly and despite the fact that the performance-enhancing abilities of the substance in question (an over-the-counter cold medication) were highly dubious<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7fj4d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7fj4d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7fj4d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">what's more, the dosage that Raducan took was low enough that in the vast majority of athletes, it wouldn't register on the test (as evidenced by the fact that Raducan's teammate Simona Amanar, who was awarded the gold medal after Raducan's disqualification, had taken the same medication in the same dose), but it did for Raducan because she was unusually petite, making everything seem that much more arbitrary</span>. Despite acknowledging these facts, the Olympic Committee refused to reinstate Raducan's medal, and the medals were re-awarded in keeping with her disqualification. (All three medal winners have stated that they consider Raducan the real champion despite her disqualification, as do almost all fans.)
</li><li> Averted in some cases, where the IOC chooses to leave the spot open instead of re-awarding the medals. Most instances of this occur in cases where it's a drug offense and someone who would be moved up wasn't drug-tested after the event, but it's also happened on a few occasions when the medal is stripped for something that doesn't constitute cheating (like undisciplined behavior at a medal ceremony), because their actions didn't affect the overall outcome of the competition<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note85ngc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note85ngc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note85ngc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the reasoning is along the lines that since a cheating offense potentially gives the cheater an advantage, re-awarding a medal after cheating is essentially giving it to someone who might have placed in that spot initially if not for the cheating; if the behavior that caused the medal strip didn't affect the competition, this doesn't apply</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with the 1994 US Women's Figure Skating Championship. After winner Tonya Harding pled guilty to hindering prosecution regarding the attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan, the USFSA stripped her of the title but opted to leave the spot blank rather than advance everyone who finished behind her.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL Quarterback</a> Tony Romo entered a qualifier for the Web.com Golf Tour, a developmental tour for the Professional Golfers Association. He and 3 others originally missed the cut by 1 position, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/24538368/tony-romo-advances-webcom-tour-qualifier-golfer-signs-incorrect-scorecard">a golfer who would have otherwise made the cut signed an erronous scorecard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and was disqualified, allowing Romo and those 3 others to advance to the next stage.
</li><li> Has happened several times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a>, but most notably in the infamous 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, where the disqualification affected both the outcome of the race and the Driver's Championship. Brazilian world champion and McLaren driver Ayrton Senna needed to win this race and the Australian Grand Prix to win the championship<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9d164');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9d164" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9d164');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At worst, Senna would've then tied with his teammate Alain Prost at 78 (due to only the 11 best finishes counting towards the Driver's Championship) but would've won it by having 8 victories to Prost's 4</span>. Several laps before the end of the race, both Prost and Senna came together at the final chicane with Prost deciding to call it a day and Senna frantically trying to get the marshalls to push-start him away from his dangerous position. Senna would take the chequered ahead of Benetton's Alessandro Nannini, but would be disqualified before the podium proceedings for having driven down the escape road and missed the chicane<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10iw2v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10iw2v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10iw2v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although some have speculated that the French F1 president at the time Jean-Marie Balestre may have used his influence to tip the championship in favour of his fellow countryman Prost</span>. Thus Alain Prost won the Driver's Championship while Alessandro Nannini won his first and only Grand Prix win, before his F1 career was cut short by a helicopter accident that nearly cost him his right arm.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> had a very infamous example in the 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400 known as Spingate or the Singapore Sling. To elaborate:
<ul><li> Under the Chase system at the time, 12 drivers were eligible to make the Chase: the top 10 in points, with two additional Wild Card spots for drivers positioned 11th-20th in the points with race wins. Entering the race, Kasey Kahne had already locked up the first Wild Card spot as he was the only repeat winner in the field outside of the top 10 in points, with his two race wins from earlier in the year (Bristol in March, and Pocono in August). Ryan Newman entered the race trailing Martin Truex, Jr. for the final wild card. In order to guarantee a Chase position, Newman needed to either win the race, or be five points ahead of Truex and not have Joey Logano or Greg Biffle fall out of the top ten (as if either Logano or Biffle dropped out of the top ten at the end of the race, the other Wild Card spot would go to one of them). Jeff Gordon trailed Logano by 16 points for 10th place, the final Chase spot based on points position.
</li><li> On Lap 393, Gordon was ahead of Logano by a large enough margin that Gordon led Logano by two points for the final guaranteed Chase position. Newman was the leader, and would have bumped out both Logano and Truex (one win each) had the race ended at that point. It was on that lap that Truex's teammate Clint Bowyer spun out in Turn 4. From the various angles captured of the spin, it initially appeared that Bowyer had either been tapped from behind by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. or he had cut a right front tire. The field pitted under the resulting caution flag, including Bowyer, Truex's other teammate Brian Vickers, Newman and the rest of the field. A slow pit stop for Newman dropped him to third, behind Carl Edwards, Paul Menard, with Kurt Busch starting next to him in 4th. As a result of the pit stops, Truex gained multiple positions. Logano, who was two laps behind the leader (while Gordon was on the lead lap), used a wavearound to move up to one lap behind the leaders, where he could race other cars one lap behind in an attempt to gain more positions and overtake Gordon. Edwards went on to win, albeit with controversy as it appeared he jumped Paul Menard on the restart, with Kurt Busch and Newman finishing behind Edwards. However, Edwards was not penalized (as had happened to Jimmie Johnson at Dover in June) as NASCAR ruled that Menard had spun his tires and was slow getting up to speed. End result, Newman and Truex finished tied for the final wildcard spot on both wins, and the first tie-breaker, points. However, since Truex had an extra second-place finish at Texas, he entered the Chase. Logano, who overtook Gordon on the final restart, clinched the final non-wild card spot by one point over Gordon.
</li><li> Immediately after the race, many in the garage suspected that Bowyer had spun out deliberately in an attempt to manipulate the finish of the race so that Truex would gain a Chase spot. This led to the incident's second nickname as the Singapore Sling because it was compared heavily to the 2008 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix in Formula One, where Nelson Piquet, Jr. intentionally caused a caution to give an advantage to teammate Fernando Alonso, who would win the race. Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who was directly behind Bowyer at the moment of the spin, said afterwards that the way Bowyer's car spun was "one of the craziest things he's ever seen", and noticed the car being "jerked around" to make it lose control out of turn 4. While Bowyer claimed it was a flat tire that caused him to spin out, and indeed the right front was down after the spin, Dale Jr.'s version of events and video replay showed Bowyer's car behaving inconsistent with the normal behavior of a car that had cut a tire: normally, when a car cuts a tire in the corners, it washes up the track without steering and slams the outside wall on its right side, then comes back down onto the track, rather than spinning onto the apron. In addition, the popping noise normally associated with a flat tire only happened after the spin. Further suspicion arose during the video replays, as the radio communications between Bowyer and crew chief Brian Pattie showed they were openly worried about the possibility of Newman winning and eliminating Truex from the Chase on lap 391, two laps before Bowyer spun. Another suspicious conversation was revealed between Vickers and his spotter, team general manager and vice president Ty Norris, where Norris ordered a completely oblivious Vickers to make a green-flag pit stop after the restart on lap 398 in order to give Truex another position to tie Newman in points. These conversations seemed to provide evidence of some kind of manipulation going on via team orders. In order for the scheme to work, Gordon, who was in 10th place, had to be overtaken by Logano in order to guarantee Truex a wild card.
</li><li> End result, NASCAR penalized Michael Waltrip Racing by fining the team $300,000the highest fine imposed on a team in NASCAR's 67-year history. It also indefinitely suspended Ty Norris, placed all three of MWR crew chiefs on probation until December 31, and docked Bowyer and Truex 50 driver points. The penalty was retroactively applied to their point totals before the reset for the Chase, which effectively dropped Truex's point finish to 17th, causing him to be knocked out of the Chase and replaced with Newman.
</li><li> After this issue, rumors surfaced that Logano had received assistance from David Gilliland. Penske and Front Row were considered technical partners, as they both used Ford cars and Roush Fenway Racing powertrains. Radio communications seemed to suggest to NASCAR that Front Row officials asked Gilliland to slow down and give up a position to Logano in order to help Logano race his way into the Chase, in exchange for an undisclosed form of compensation.
</li><li> Between these two cases of team orders, NASCAR CEO Brian France made the decision right before the opening Chase race at Chicagoland to add Gordon to the Chase field, expanding the field to 13 drivers, "based on the totality of events that were outside" Gordon's control, and the team orders of MWR and Penske being meant to give Gordon an "unfair disadvantage", coupled with the fact that if Bowyer hadn't spun and the caution hadn't come out at any point between lap 393 and the white flag, Gordon would have qualified for the Chase on points based on his running position.
</li><li> The effects of Spingate lasted many years. NAPA Auto Parts withdrew their sponsorship of Truex's #56 at the end of the season, signing new partnerships with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Hendrick Motorsports to become Chase Elliott's primary sponsor, which they've been ever since. They sponsored Elliott's ride at JR Motorsports in the Nationwide / Xfinity Series for 2014 and 2015, then followed him to the Cup series when he became a full-time driver for Hendrick Motorsports in 2016 to replace the retired Jeff Gordon. Meanwhile, without a ride, Truex and his entire team got picked up by Furniture Row Racing for 2014, and after a dud year, brought that team a 4th place finish in the points in 2015, then a Monster Energy Cup championship in 2017, and a runner-up finish in the points to Logano for 2018 before the team folded and Truex ended up at Joe Gibbs Racing for 2019.
</li></ul></li><li> The animated television series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> was created from a pitch creator Pete Williams made as part of a contest MTV held, which he only won because, of the 15 competitors who entered, Williams was the only one who bothered to follow the instructions.
