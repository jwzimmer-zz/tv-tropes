</p><p>It Only Works Once is a trick or technique which is completely useless in the following episodes.

The duration can be permanent if worded correctly, but if the effect ends, that individual can never again be affected by the power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That is, unless Jeremiah uses his Geass Canceler to undo the effects. But even then, if he does, Lelouch's power can work on someone again.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Kido Cannon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BleachMemoriesOfNobody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BleachMemoriesOfNobody">Bleach: Memories of Nobody</a></em> burns itself to ash after being fired only once.
</li><li> The series has shown a couple of examples where a character can enter a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> at the cost of losing all of their powers when it wears off. Naturally, it also provides ways to regain their powers.
</li><li> There's also Muramasa, main antagonist of the anime filler Zanpakutō Rebellion arc. Muramasa is a Zanpakutō spirit whose power is bringing other Zanpakutō spirits to life and turning them against their masters. He does this by tapping into their most suppressed instinct and using it to control them. The only clear way to break the spell is to defeat the Zanpakutō spirit, but if that happens, Muramasa's power won't be able to affect it a second time.
</li><li> This is what makes defeating Askin so difficult. Because he has the power to control his and others' resistance to anything he's experienced and absorbed once before, if it didn't kill him the first time (and he's <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">hard to kill</a>), it won't affect him at all the second.

The first time he fires, he misses a fatal shot at Joseph, but nicks his neck. The next time he tries it, he hits a mirror reflection of Joseph, and then the third time, it is completely reflected. Joseph lampshades that he only needed to see the attack once to know how to counter it, due to the predictability that Straits would go for the fatal shots in the neck and forehead again.
<ul><li> Subverted in Part 1 where Jonathan is caught off guard by Dio's attack of the same kind, as the first time it was used, he was plummeting off a cliff and didn't see it firsthand. The second time it is used, he had no idea it was coming.
<ul><li> The above two can also be grouped together, as the attack ended up being fatal to Jonathan in the first real encounter with it, but the story of the attack was passed down through Erina to Joseph, her grandson. As a result, it never succeeds from the start on Joseph because he already knew how the move worked.
</li></ul></li><li> Part 3's Anubis inverts this trope. Along with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">unique</a> traits, its skill in swordsmanship is so extreme that using the same attack twice against it is completely ineffective.
</li><li> Later on in Part 7, during the climax of the D4C arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gyro uses the Super Spin Technique to attack Valentine. This attack rapidly ages cells to the point of death. Though technically successful, an imperfection in the steel ball cancels the perfect rotation, allowing Valentine to survive the attack. Gyro doesn't get another shot</span>. Johnny later attempts the same feat, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Valentine's</span> warning prevents <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Dio from another world</span> from suffering the same fate.
</li></ul></li><li> The Gold Saints in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> take pride in repeating how an opponent can only use a technique against them once, and then becomes ineffective. Their reasoning is that, having seen the attack once, they've learned how to avoid it. Sometimes the Bronze Saints are allowed to repeat this phrase, but only if their enemy poses no real threat whatsoever.
<ul><li> Only problem is that Seiya <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">insists in using the same technique over and over</a>, initially not hitting his enemy, but eventually it does and he didn't change his technique, he's just doing it faster.
</li><li> Only SAINTS OF ATHENA have such a power or technique, as they learn to do it with their training. Seiya's case is always lampshaded as meteors being so numerous they turn into one big attack. Still, the dialogue fails to convey this realistically or seriously.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Numerous villains seem to just give up after an ass-kicking by Luffy and co. despite the fact that they could logically resume their activities after the Straw Hats have left the area. Especially since Luffy and company nearly never actually kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Most of the time, they go a ways to justify why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> doesn't do this, but occasionally they don't bother.
</li><li> First example: Captain Kuro. Kuro had planned to leave a life of piracy by instilling himself as a butler of a rich child. After a few years, he was going to have his hypnotist force her to write Kuro into her will, then kill her and take her money. Instead, he gets beat up and forced back out to sea. Though he couldn't have pulled this trick again on the same island (and would need to adjust the plan for a lack of a hypnotist), no one else knew he was alive and he could have tried elsewhere. Yet he's still a pirate as far as we know. Later, it's revealed that the Marines learned that Kuro had faked his death; this is likely because the hypnotist had joined the Navy after Kuro's defeat, but it's never made clear.
</li><li> Next is Buggy, who had taken over a town. Luffy beats him and sends him flying. He could always just stay the course. However, Buggy being Buggy, he holds a grudge and starts following Luffy instead. This also happened to Alvida, who joined Buggy.
</li><li> Crocodile looks this way since his loss of Warlord of the Sea status means he can no longer operate out in the open without drawing attention from the Marines, but his criminal organization still exists. A miniarc revealed that after Luffy defeated him, Crocodile lost interest in the outside world, which is why he doesn't bother escaping jail with most of the rest of his Officer Agents. However, when he heard about the impending war with Whitebeard and the World Government and Luffy showed up on Level 6 attempting to rescue his brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">he offered his power to help them escape</a>, his interest rekindled by a chance to strike back at the pirate who ruined his dreams of becoming King. And with that pirate's death, he's ready to give it another shot; the next time Crocodile is seen after that arc, he has plans to head towards the New World again.
</li><li> On the topic of Alabasta, there's Nami's Clima-Tact; Usopp had made it little more than a tool for parlor tricks, but the Tornado Tempo was specifically described as an attack that can work only once. This is due to the attack relying on wound springs inside one of the 3 poles. Once it fires it looks like it would take significant effort to reload (think trying to re-coil a stretched out slinky) and many of Nami's attacks require all 3 poles so losing one means her fight is basically over regardless of if she's won or not.
<div class="indent"><strong>Usopp's Instructions:</strong> Tornado Tempo packs a knockout punch. However, it is absolutely a weapon of last resort! You have only one shot! If you miss, it's all over.
</div></li><li> Brook's Devil Fruit grants him the ability to come back from the dead... once. Since his soul took too long to find his body, he is now a living, still killable skeleton. But with training, he has subverted the trope by expanding on his power, making its ability to revive him only one aspect of his powers.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> Roger Smith finally puts some of the pieces of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> together and unlocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> built into his mecha just in time to put an end to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Wouldn't you know: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He missed, and firing the one shot burns the gun to a crisp</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/REDLINE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/REDLINE">REDLINE</a></em>: The president of Roboworld uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Three-Point Disintegration Cannon</a> to try to kill Funky Boy. Unfortunately, Funky Boy regenerates, while the Cannon needs two hours to recharge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em>: Cobra's arch enemy of the Three Sister's Arc, Crystal Boy, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> to just about every attack Cobra used against him. Near the end of the Arc Cobra faces off against him and after a long fight he catches him off guard by launching his fake arm at him via the Psychogun, presumably killing him. When he appears in the Psychogun OVA Cobra attempts to kill him the exact same way only to have him catch the fist mid air and proclaim that the same trick wasn't going to work twice.
</li><li> In the first episode of the series, a hectic encounter with hostile aliens forces <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em> to reveal a decoration on the Aloha Oe that is actually an explosive powerful enough to an destroy an entire planet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">had though it through</a>, he would've realized that detonating it spells doom for <em>everybody</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDownerEnding">including himself and his crew</a>.</span>

<ul><li> In a similar instance to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> example above, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVA</a> pitted (female) Ranma and Akane versus two powerful sisters (never happened in the manga). After getting creamed in their first match, the two leads train for a rematch. The sisters' ordinary attacks then prove ineffective against Akane (who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">trained up to their level</a>) and their special skills are useless against Ranma (who explicitly says, "Your wind attack ain't gonna get me twice! I've seen it once and it's easier to avoid it!")
</li><li> Turning the trope on the villain's favor, the manga confronted Ranma with the Musk Prince Herb, descendant of a dragon and master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">chi techniques</a>. When Ranma tried to use the overwhelmingly powerful Hiryu Shoten Ha technique on him, Herb recognized it and easily dodged it, since he had seen it many times before in the past and it was arguably part of his education. This is later turned around on Herb when Ranma tries the technique again, mocking her that it wont work since hes dodged and countered it before. Ranma counters that Herbs dodge move wont work this time as she had upgraded the technique within the battle into the Hiryu Korin Dan. This was the same problem with Happōsai, who had once been on the receiving end of this technique (from a young Cologne) and already knew how to thwart it.
</li><li> Even further: when Ranma used the Parlay du Fois Gras technique on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Picolet Chardin</a>, it only worked for a few instants; both he and his teacher recognized the technique and immediately used a variety of defenses. Although Ranma tried to use new variations to get around these counters, each only worked once, until she was left with no way to attack her opponent.

Her talent is to have whatever talent she wants at the moment. It was soon discovered she could only use each talent once, but she could achieve the same results by using variations. Which makes it not much of a limitation at all, though some specific effects she might want to produce will naturally have more variations available than others.
<ul><li> In <em>The Dastard</em> Surprise finds out that she can perform the same spell twice with a significant period of time between the two only to have her discovery erased from time by The Dastard.
</li><li> Talents themselves are a form of this in <em>Xanth.</em> Each person has a unique magical talent, and it's strongly implied (if not outright stated) that talents will never reoccur. Once a person with a specific talent dies, no one else will ever have that specific talent ever again. Talents can overlap in their effects (with Surprise's talent, by definition, overlapping with <em>everyone</em> else's), but no two are ever exactly the same.

The weapon destroys a major Galactic Alliance fleet, and Centerpoint powers down, unable to be used ever again.

The popular consensus is that the undead army was not magically compelled to obey Aragorn, but did so voluntarily as he was the only one who could release them to pass on to a more standard afterlife. If they'd gotten it into their heads that he did not intend to release them, they could very well have gone over to the other side, so he decided that it was better to be safe than sorry.

It should also be noted that it is never made clear (in the books at least) if the army of the dead can <em>physically</em> hurt people, as the only army they deal with they simply terrify into fleeing. If they could not actually attack people, once the psychological impact of them wore off, their usefulness would be greatly reduced. Regardless, they demanded to be released after a single battle, and he complied.

Sima Yi is wary of Zhuge Liang's strategic brilliance and assumes it to be a triple bluff as Zhuge Liang's plans never leave his army open to this kind of risk.

The obvious workaround for this is changing the phaser frequency to something they <em>haven't</em> adapted to. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce">Star Trek: Elite Force</a></em> games explicitly addressed this issue by introducing the Infinity Modulator (or I-Mod) gun, which changes frequencies too quickly for Borg to adapt.
<ul><li> In the first level of the second game (based on the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>), the Borg adapt to the I-Mod as well by using a jamming field specifically designed to stop the I-Mod from firing. The player is forced to do the mission with regular weapons, using shots sparingly.
</li><li> The I-Mod actually infinitely randomizes the frequency to such an extent that the Borg can't even adapt to the randomization algorithm normally used by phasers.
</li><li> In the series itself, much is made of this trope when anyone is simply <em>planning</em> on fighting the Borg.

That is, however, assuming the players are smart enough to see through it all.

For physical powers, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explained</a> that they are so physically demanding or reliant on surprise tactics that your character can only perform (or get away with them) once.

The example given is throwing sand in an opponent's eyes to blind him — might work once, but if it were really that effective all the time, "fighters would leave their weapons at home and carry bags of sand instead." Thus to keep the game balance, creative gambits should only work once.

This makes it much or difficult or even impossible to destroy him the same way again.
</li><li> Almost every RPG is open to this trope. The GM probably had a pretty good idea of how you are supposed to get past a bad guy but either hinted at it too subtly, the players were point blank oblivious to anything other than violence or hilariously botched rolls while trying to figure it out, they just don't get there. And that means that the GM either has to murder all the PCs or let them lash together a plan between themselves to leapfrog this particular station on the plot railroad. But only this time.
<ul><li> Alternatively players being what they are, they may put in WAY more time and effort into working out how to defeat the bad guy from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> perspective than the GM hoped, and thus arrive at a fait-accompli that is irrefutable from a rules standpoint but not what he had in mind.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Master Ball, which has a 100% chance of capturing any Pokémon, but you're only guaranteed a single one in each game, which becomes especially frustrating in later generations as the number of stupidly difficult-to-catch Pokémon increases. You <em>can</em> get more through the lottery in most games, but the default odds are 1 in 100,000.
</li><li> There is an item called the Sacred Ash, which revives all fainted Pokémon in your party AND fully restores their HP. The catch is that it appears almost exclusively in the presence of wild Ho-Oh, so there's only one in the game. The Festival Plaza in <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>, however, lets you purchase it.
</li><li> Technical Machines (TMs) were initially one-use items and often limited to one per-game, so you only had one opportunity to teach Blizzard to a Pokémon. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> onwards, however, made them have infinite uses.
<ul><li> Some TMs were buyable in the first four generations, so the player technically could teach certain TM moves to multiple members of their party. However, the TMs could still only be <em>used</em> once apiece, so players would have to repeatedly buy them to do so.
</li><li> Generation VIII mixes up the formula; TMs remain infinite in usage, but the moves that they teach are often on the weaker side. TRs (Technical Records), on the other hand, are single-use variants that generally teach much stronger moves.
</li></ul></li><li> There are a few moves like Overheat and Draco Meteor that, while very powerful, cut the user's Special Attack stat in half. Naturally, this means that it should wipe out whatever it attacks because the Pokémon will be effectively useless for the remainder of its time out of the ball. This can be remedied by recalling it, but as that's the obvious move, the opponent will be able to predict you doing that.
</li><li> A more extreme version would be sacrificial moves which cause the user to faint. These range from support (such as the stat-lowering Memento and the healing Lunar Dance) to attacks (such as the high-power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Explosion</a> or the damage-equal-to-lost-HP Final Gambit).
</li><li> The move Fake Out is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative">high priority</a> attack that makes the target flinch 100% of the time, but it only works on the first turn the user is sent out.
<ul><li> The same goes for First Impression, a Bug-Type variant more than twice as powerful that was introduced in Generation VII.
</li></ul></li><li> Z-Moves are devastatingly powerful and always accurate, but can only be used once per battle. Not per Pokémon, but for <em>the whole battle</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolution</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">Dynamaxing</a> are the same as Z-Moves: extremely powerful, but only one Pokémon can use it per battle. And while Mega Evolution lasts until the user faints, Dynamaxing only lasts for three turns.
</li><li> Burn Up requires the user to be a Fire-type to use, and causes them to stop being Fire-type when used.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em>, the ultimate joke is this.

When none of his tricks impress the audience, he desperately tries his ultimate trick: downing several kinds of volatile explosives and then swallowing a lit match ("Girls...better hold onto your boyfriends!"). It works so well that everyone, including Bugs, are impressed, and call for more. There is just one problem: Daffy is dead and his ghost says he could only do it once.

Inque was vulnerable to freezing and water in her first appearance, but in later appearances learned to curl herself into a ball, protecting the bulk of her mass from being frozen and breaking free in short order, or modifying her chemical makeup to resist water.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Early firearms (prior to the mid-18th century or so) worked like this in ground battles. Sure, you could reload them... but it took so darned long (1-3 minutes) and the ranges of the weapons were so short (50-100 yards) that you'd be lucky to get off two (somewhat inaccurate) shots in the time it took for an enemy (on foot) to come within range, charge and attack you with something sharp and/or pointy. Bayonets were developed so that muskets could double as melee weapons, eliminating the need for pikemen. Contemporary hand grenades (thus Grenadier units) and rockets - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">like those used in China</a> - only work once.
<ul><li> Still musketeers and other gunmen usually carried somewhere between 8 and 16 reloads on their person (their flasks with gunpowder were known as "12 apostles", despite there not always being 12 of them). On top of this, there would be carts with more powder and bullets behind the lines. While some generals really liked charging to within range, having to run through the salvos of bullets usually meant the charging formation was in worse shape than the one being attacked by the time they arrived, and stood a big chance of losing the subsequent "push of pike". So it was more common to try and destabilize the enemy formation by firing at them yourselves and by sending loose skirmishers, cavalry charges and cannon fire at them, before actually going in for the melee. So most of the time, this trope was averted. There is a reason these firearms were used. Still, a rush could succeed if performed so fast that the enemy had no time to get ready for the hand to hand. This tactic saw a short period in the limelight after the invention of the plug bayonet, which had to be plugged into the barrel of the gun, and could therefore not be mounted before going into battle.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP-45_Liberator">Liberator<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> handgun. It was possible to reload them, it just took a long time. They were nearly useless as weapons, the lack of rifling meant that the bullets would sometimes strike sideways and bounce off of people if fired from more than a few feet away. The were good for super-short range kills, though — if the attacker could get within a couple feet they could be effective. The general idea was to use it to take out an occupying soldier and take <em>his</em> gun. And more importantly from the Allied perspective, to demoralize the enemy with the fact that they have no idea just how many are out there, and how many of the seemingly helpless civilians in conquered nations are actually armed.
<ul><li> The same applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>-era replacement, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_gun">Deer gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though its effectiveness as a weapon was never determined; when the war escalated, plans to hand the gun out to civilians in the same manner as the Liberator were abandoned.
</li><li> The "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgley_OSS_.38">Punch Gun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", made famous in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds">Inglourious Basterds</a></em>, is a real gun that only works once in concept. Because you have to hit your opponent to "pull" the trigger, it would be hard to not kill him. But if he has buddies around, you will be in for a rough time.
</li></ul></li><li> The tactics the 9/11 hijackers used to seize control of the planes fall into this category, even if you're not counting increased paranoia around airports making it unlikely that any repeat performances would even make it to the plane (several of the hijackers had been flagged as suspicious, but lax security meant they got through anyway).
<ul><li> Generally speaking, since most passengers in previously hijacked airliners did in fact survive, there was no reason for passengers and crew not to cooperate.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1i4e7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1i4e7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1i4e7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Standard operating procedure for most hijackers in the past was "Take over the plane, then land it somewhere and use the passengers as bargaining chips for political concessions," which often allowed governments the chance to neutralize the hijackers with minimal collateral damage.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Now that using the plane as a kamikaze weapon</a> has been firmly established as a possibility, trying to take over a plane with knives will likely not work because the passengers and crew will fight back and overpower the hijackers. In fact it is a commonly cited theory that the passengers of United Flight 93 knew what had happened to the other flights hijacked that day and either risked their lives because they had nothing left to lose or went on an outright suicide mission to subvert the attackers.
</li><li> Secondly there are standing orders that the cockpit will rarely be opened during the flight and never during an attempted hijacking. Even if the cockpit is open someone will be posted on guard to prevent access.
</li><li> Finally military pilots are trained to shoot down commercial aircraft if necessary and will do so if they consider the plane will probably be used as a missile against a strategic target.
</li></ul></li><li> The M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon, its modern successor the AT-4 and various similar designs based on the same concept. Though arguably they're a subversion, as theoretically they provide the reverse effect in practice; instead of having a dedicated RPG fireteam, who have to spend precious seconds reloading after taking a shot and can't carry a hell of a lot else besides the launch tube and its ammunition, every man in the squad can carry a one-use launcher as part of their regular gear. If one of them misses, another steps up and takes their own shot.
</li><li> Successful suicide bombing. Likewise, if you botch the bombing such that you don't die but the target knows your intentions, they'll likely try their damnedest to kill you.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse">Trojan Horse</a> gambit - <em>anyone</em> with even the most cursory knowledge of military history will know better than to fall for it. It even spawned the phrase "beware Greeks bearing gifts".
</li><li> One of the poetic metaphors for a woman's maidenhead (or, more generally, virginity) is, "the rose that can be given only once". Considering what we know now about the hymen (i.e. it can regrow or even not break during intercourse), this is not necessarily the case but it remains a truism.
</li><li> Medical examples:
<ul><li> The arsenical medicine <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melarsoprol">melarsoprol<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, used against African sleeping sickness, is <em>extremely</em> toxic. So toxic, in fact, that it can't be administered to someone who's already been dosed with it.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precordial_thump">precordial thump<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a sharp punch to the sternum sometimes attempted during CPR, as a form of mechanical defibrillation in the event you don't have an AED. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">In real life</a>, it's never done more than once. The thump has to be performed within 60 seconds of the onset of symptoms, making it useless in all but immediately witnessed arrest. (In fact, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-zones/accident-and-emergency/resuscitation-skills-part-five-precordial-thump/203136.article">one study<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, all reported successes have been within <em>ten</em> seconds!) Basic CPR training no longer includes it at all, and Advanced Cardiac Life Support only mentions it in passing.
</li><li> Cats do not have antibodies for dog blood cells, so if no feline blood is available, an injured cat can receive canine blood instead. However, within four days the cat will have developed said antibodies and can never receive dog blood again without suffering a severe (likely fatal) reaction.
</li><li> Some diseases only affect each person once, since the next time they get infected the body already knows how to deal with the problem. In fact, this is the idea behind vaccines: get infected with a harmless version of a microbe so your body is ready when you have to face the real one. But this also works the other way, since some diseases evolve too quickly for immunity to last very long. This is why new flu shots are issued each year to keep up with new strains.
</li></ul></li><li> Ceramic trauma plates for body armor can work this way. When struck with significant energy (by a bullet, hammer, fragment, splinter or by being dropped), it will crack and the effectiveness of the plate degrades, but isn't automatically rendered useless. However, a second hit in the same general area will typically go through, making this trope true for hits in the same location. With luck, subsequent hits will be far enough away from the damaged areas to be stopped as well. This won't work forever, but has been seen in the field.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2b3h0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2b3h0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2b3h0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Perhaps one of the most poignant examples would be of SFC Paul Ray Smith. Sergeant Smith served with the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, 11th Engineer Battalion. On April 4, 2003, SFC Smith's position came under fire from insurgents in Baghdad. Heavily outgunned and with over 100 combat casualties awaiting evacuation, SFC Smith took control of the M2 machine gun on a damaged M113 APC and returned fire from the unprotected turret mount. SFC Smith died in the action, although not before repelling enemy forces. Once friendly forces were able to get to him, his body armor was found to have taken at least 13 hits, none of which penetrated; the killing shot passed through his neck, severing his spine, and killing him instantly. An acceptable account of the incident can be found <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ray_Smith">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the military citation <a class="urllink" href="http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=2561">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. </span> Though heavier, the ballistic value of ceramic plates is generally much higher than traditional metal trauma plates.
<ul><li> This is also the case behind Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) for tanks and armored personnel vehicles. When touched by an EFP (Explosively-Formed Projectile, the most common form of anti-armor round in use today, which essentially is a bolt of molten metal), the ERA plate explodes, disrupting the jet and preventing it from penetrating the vehicle's armor. Once an ERA plate detonates, that section is unprotected from further hits until it is replaced. While it's very hard to hit the same spot twice, especially from far away, it's not impossible. ERA-protected vehicles have been destroyed by such unlucky double strikes. Newer armor-defeat munitions actually stack multiple shape-charge warheads that fire in sequence, burning through ERA and armor and allowing the hindmost EFP to penetrate to do damage.
</li></ul></li><li> Before the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, an excited fan sent Bethesda a box of real-life bottle caps weighing over 11 pounds with a tongue-in-cheek letter asking Bethesda if this would be an acceptable substitute for payment (for those who dont know, bottle caps are currency in the Fallout universe). To his surprise, Bethesda then sent him an email accepting the "payment", and agreeing to send him a copy with the understanding that it'll only work the one time.
</li><li> A "zero-day" vulnerability is a computer security hole that is not yet generally known, named for the fact that nobody has had time to develop defenses "zero days" after someone discovers and exploits the vulnerability. Once a zero-day exploit is used and noticed, cybersecurity experts will study it and develop countermeasures to be distributed in future security patches.
</li><li> In Sports, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>, trick plays tend to fall in one of three categories: Either they're so ingenious, they become part of the game, or they work based on being illogical and not what the opponent would expect (in which case they will remain rare and often only used in desperate situations) and the third category are those that make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>, in which case there is likely to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> right after it's been used the first time. The first category is often not even considered a "trick" any more and includes stuff like play action passes, the second includes stuff like fake punts and the third includes stuff that is usually subject to quite a bit of controversy afterwards.
<ul><li> The "Holy Roller" was a controversial play in a 1978 Raiders v Chargers football game where the Raiders' quarterback, upon being tackled, "fumbled" the ball up the field towards the end zone. Another player then also tried to grab it, "fumbling" it as well to a third player, who "struggled" to get ahold of the ball until it was in the end-zone, at which point they fell on it for a touchdown. After the play, the rules were changed so that forward fumbles could not be recovered by the offense for a gain, and years later, the players involved admitted that they had deliberately fumbled the ball forward, which would have made the whole play illegal even under the rules at the time.
</li><li> In 2015, the Patriots ran a trick play against the Ravens in a playoff game which relied on confusing the Ravens about which players were eligible receivers. Per the rules at the time, the offense was required to inform the referee which of their linesmen were eligible or ineligible receivers, and the referee was required to inform the defending team that one of the linesmen was an ineligible receiver. However, more information wasn't required, making it unclear to the Ravens who exactly was and was not an eligible receiver, making it much harder for the Ravens to defend against passing plays. After the game, new requirements were put in place for identifying ineligible receivers at a glance based on where they lined up.
