<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It is alleged that Godwin (author of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdEquations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColdEquations">The Cold Equations</a>") essentially took the story from a story published in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a>' <em>Weird Science</em> #13, May-June 1952, called "A Weighty Decision," scripted by Al Feldstein. In that story there are three astronauts who are intended to be on the flight, not one, and the additional passenger, a girl that one of the astronauts has fallen in love with, is trapped aboard by a mistake rather than stowing away. As in The Cold Equations, various measures are proposed but the only one which will not lead to worse disaster is for the unwitting passenger to be jettisoned. Other sources note that the theme of Feldstein's story is itself strikingly similarly to the story "Precedent", published by E.C. Tubb in 1949; in that story, as in the others, a stowaway must be ejected from a spaceship because the fuel aboard is only enough for the planned passengers. These sources argue that neither Feldstein nor Godwin intentionally "swiped" from the stories that came before, but merely produced similar variations on an ancient theme, that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">an individual being sacrificed so that the rest may survive</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin">Tintin</a></em> comic album <em>Explorers on the Moon</em>, when Thompson and Thomson turn up as accidental stowaways on the Moon-Rocket, Calculus worries that, since oxygen supplies were assessed for only four people, there might not be enough for six, and decides to shorten the trip from fourteen to ten days. It gets worse when Colonel Jorgen is revealed to have smuggled himself on board, with the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>. He intends to maroon Tintin and his companions on the surface of the Moon, pointing out that they don't have enough oxygen to bring prisoners back to Earth. Later when the villains are overpowered, Tintin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">refuses to leave them behind</a> despite having exactly the same problem. After Jorgen is killed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunStruggle">Gun Struggle</a>, Wolff decides to atone for his actions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">by stepping out the airlock</a>. Even so Tintin and his companions almost don't make it back to Earth.

</li><li> Twisted for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Xxxenophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Xxxenophile">Xxxenophile</a></em> story. The bomb shelter will only hold two, and the female character tells her two male companions that if she has to repopulate the Earth she wants to enjoy herself doing it, so "auditions" are now in order. World War III did <em>not</em> just break out, she said it had as an excuse for threesome sex.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> films are built around the idea of people being slated to die at particular moments in time, and Death coming back for them (in the order in which they would've died naturally) when somebody, thanks to a premonition of a coming disaster, manages to save themselves and some of their friends. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5">Final Destination 5</a></em> raises the idea that somebody marked for death can kill somebody else and gain the time that their victim had until they were fated to die. Nathan accidentally kills Roy and so gets passed over in Death's order, causing Peter, who is next in line, to try and kill Molly (the one person in their group who didn't die in Sam's premonition of the disaster) in order to claim the time that she had left. The ending reveals that Nathan only bought himself a couple of weeks, because Roy's autopsy revealed a massive aneurysm in his brain that would've burst "any day now" had he not died sooner — meaning that the film ends with Nathan getting squashed.

Operation Chariot is a secret government program to save valuable or useful people in the event of a massive attack on the United States.

The time travelers will have to remain on Earth and either find a way to survive in the caves or attempt to rebuild their time portal.

Every passenger grabs a parachute and jumps, but the last three realize there's only two parachutes left.

At the last moment Hutch realises all they have to do is melt the 'snow' (actually frozen atmosphere) to get the needed oxygen. Later on another pilot is looking at his shuttle — named after a pilot who famously performed a similar sacrifice — and bemoans the fact that such exciting heroics don't happen now that spaceflight has become routine and safe.
</li><li> In <em>Chindi</em>, Hutch is piloting a ship being sent for standby duty at a research station near an unstable star. When she's nearly there, she realizes that the list of Academy personnel on the station includes a teacher, which suggests that the researchers may have their families there—but due to a bureaucratic snafu, her ship is only large enough to carry the listed personnel! At which point, an EM pulse from the star fries everyone's communications systems, and the explosion that caused the pulse looks like it will destroy the station. A number of researchers volunteer to go down with the station, so that others might live, but fortunately, someone back home noticed the snafu, and when communications go out, hurriedly redirects another ship, which arrives just in the nick of time.

Unfortunately, they run into heavy cloud which is lethally contaminated with fallout, and the Antonov doesn't have the fuel to make the trip at the higher altitude required to clear the fallout. So the Russian co-pilot calls for volunteers and opens the Anti's cargo doors, and leads a procession of about one-third of the passengers on the long drop into oblivion.

It involves getting trapped in a cave-in with another miner. You have a gun with two bullets and sleeping pills.

Kodos "the Executioner", former governor of the Earth colony of Tarsus IV, was responsible for the massacre of over 4000 people, including members of Kirk's family. Governor Kodos had ordered the executions of more than half Tarsus IV's population after the food supply was all but destroyed by a fungus.

It so happened that the vital resupply ships that could have saved the whole colony arrived much sooner than Kodos had anticipated, rendering all the executions unnecessary.

They may escape when they make it through a door with a nine on it, and some of the characters realize early on that no more than five people can escape.

However, this is soon double subverted when, after the two doors, there is another room with a single door with a nine; characters who are left behind after that will still have a chance to escape, but they don't know that when deciding who passes through the door.

Complicating matters is the fact that he can't contact the rest of the station, so he has no idea if the rest of the crew is even still alive.

The doctor of the ship has to put first their escorted passenger, then the rest of the crew bar the navigator, <em>including himself</em>, into a risky experimental coma to preserve the little remaining life support (cutting resource usage into a tenth). Piling on the problem, they are also low on fuel with their method of manual fuel extraction destroyed, so they discuss and realize that their only option is to go to a modern-day-era tech-level system and hope they can refuel on the desolate refueling station until they find a higher-tech system that offers a way to resuscitate the comatose crew... assuming they can even be put into a coma with the combination of space-morphine and dice rolls. Miraculously, they do... but the navigator then realizes that while he made it to the system, he doesn't have the life support to fly to a fuel station and must instead crash-land onto the only inhabited planet.

<ul><li> This scenario can also be about the evils of nuclear proliferation: there's six people but only room in the nuke shelter for five — whom do you throw out? There would usually be an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> character like a priest, supposedly proving the irrelevance of organised religion.

</li><li> There's an urban myth where people found the dead body of a man in the desert holding a piece of straw. In a line from his body are clothes and equipment. It's impossible for him to have walked and there are no tracks leading away from a vehicle. The solution to the mystery is that he was on a balloon that was descending over the desert; the passengers threw out everything they could to gain height, before realizing one person would have to go.

One person must be thrown out, but who? Turns out the old woman fought for women's rights, the businessman earns hundreds of dollars through fraud, and the teenager's actually injecting himself with insulin—he's diabetic. (Of course, many people would just pick the wealthy-looking man immediately, giving it a rather different message: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich">Eat the Rich</a>.)
</li><li> The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment that makes use of a Cold Equation to gauge people's ethics: You see a runaway trolley moving toward five incapacitated people lying on the tracks, and you are standing next to the lever that will redirect the trolley onto a side track that misses the five people. However, there is one person lying on the side track. Your only two options are 1: pull the lever and kill the one person to save five, or 2: do nothing and let the five people on the main track die. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">According to numerous surveys, 90% of people opt to pull the lever. However, according to further surveys, that number drasticaly decreases if they are the ones who must push someone into the path of the oncoming trolley directly, or are given other various qualifiers, such as it being five drunks who shouldn't be on the tracks vs a railroad employee doing their job.</span>

A black tag on someone who isn't dead yet means they're not to be given any medical treatment except pain medication until everyone else is dealt with because their injuries are almost certainly fatal with the resources available and efforts spent on them would end up unavailable to people who have a higher probability of living.
