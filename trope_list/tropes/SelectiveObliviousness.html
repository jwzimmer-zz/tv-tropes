<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another">Another</a></em>:
<ul><li> The students of Class 3 manage to force and subvert this trope, in an effort to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stop the calamity that kills off members of the class and their family members</span>. Due to the calamity being caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one person in the class actually being dead</span>, it can be averted if the class <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ignores one person in the class and pretends they don't exist... which only works <em>sometimes</em>, and it's hinted to only work if they pick the right one, which is pure chance</span>. They originally choose <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mei Misaki</span>, until the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up talking to her, having not been briefed by the class on how to behave. This appears to start the calamity all over again, and the students even resort to ignoring the protagonist himself, with no success. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>, because the calamity had actually started before — with someone related to <em>Mei</em>, so she couldn't tell them because they were ignoring her</span>.
</li><li> Also present in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the one dead person in the class is impossible to detect, since everyone in the class and town and even the dead person themselves have no recollection of their death — at least, that is, unless someone kills them, in which case everything goes back to normal and everyone, except for the person who returned them to death, remembers them for how they really died, and has no recollection of their ever being in the class</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Naruto didn't realize Hinata had strong feelings for him, something many of the other ninjas were easily able to figure out. He also doesn't realize that Sasuke really doesn't want to come back to the village, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after Sasuke impales him and almost kills Sakura and Kakashi</span>.
</li><li> Naruto's not the only one with a tendency towards this trope when it comes to Sasuke - Sakura's just as bad, always believing that eventually Sasuke will come back to them no matter how many times she is proven wrong - she still keeps her love for Sasuke even when he <em>actively tried to kill her.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually he does pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> for good and they have a daughter together, but even then Sasuke chooses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth">Walk the Earth</a> to atone for his previous deeds.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> The bombastic Tatewaki "Blue Thunder" Kuno refuses to believe that the hated Ranma Saotome and his beloved "Pigtailed Girl" are one and the same, even when Ranma changes <em>right in his arms</em>. After a while, one wonders if he isn't fully aware and just forcing himself not to think about it. His sister has a similar ailment, but she isn't confronted with the evidence quite as often (and in the anime, never) and actually tried to figure out what happened before getting sidetracked. Kuno might also be purposely ignoring all of the blatant evidence that neither of his "love interests" actually even likes him, let alone lusts after him... although this may be less Selective Obliviousness and more a cocktail of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> grade lechery (Kuno is debatably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>) and whopping ego.
</li><li> Akane Tendo is often accused of this regarding the fact that her pet pig is actually the cursed form of one of Ranma's rivals for her affections. It's got to be the biggest problem she brings to the relationship, even worse than her insecurity. That's not to say that Ranma doesn't contribute his own flaws, faults, and problems, but when she's been shown to consciously ignore Ranma's attempts to explain how a situation wasn't what it looked like, to the extent that the manga version of Akane ignored Ranma's outright telling her why he was trying to grope Hinako, coupled with <em>showing</em> her the <em>pressure point chart</em> he was using, in order to support her own belief that it's because Ranma is an uncontrollable lecher. In the anime canon, this flaw is actually the explicit reason why Akane is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>; she refuses to follow the recipe and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">adds extra ingredients that she ''believes'' will make it even better</a> (and then adds the <em>wrong</em> wrong ingredients, due to not looking at what she's grabbing), and refuses to admit her cooking habits are <em>why</em> nobody will ever eat her cooking unless forced. In one episode, she spends the entire night trying to make edible cookies and continues to repeat the same mistakes over and over even though each and every batch turns out terrible. When Ranma finally allows himself to be guilted into eating her latest batch, and promptly takes to his room with severe stomach pains, Akane idly declares that the recipe must have been faulty.
</li><li> Kasumi Tendo calls people who are actively trying to murder Ranma his "friends". Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> into one of her defining traits.
</li><li> Mousse could be called Selectively Oblivious in regards to Shampoo. He refuses to admit that the girl he's been chasing since they were three has never shown any sign of reciprocated interest, at best ignoring him and more commonly hitting him whenever he made one of his "romantic" gestures/speeches. By the late manga, she's perfectly willing to let him die just to be rid of him. Instead, Mousse blames her lack of interest on her (willingly given and clearly backed by genuine emotion, at least in the anime) engagement to Ranma and frequently assaults the Japanese boy, accusing him of seducing Shampoo or otherwise keeping her away from Mousse.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> was interesting in that it <em>didn't</em> portray the girl (Shiori) practicing Selective Obliviousness in a positive light. One can also argue that Utena starts indulging in this after episode 31.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em>, no one (except Kamiyama, Hayashida, and the Doctor that performed the school physicals) seems to notice that Mechazawa is, in fact, a robot. The same for the student gorilla.
</li><li> Kyon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> very deliberately ignores any hinting that the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chessgame of Life may have a King (who decides the game) as well as a Queen (who has the power in the game)</span>; he refuses to acknowledge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tachibana flat out telling him that <em>he</em> has the power to transfer Haruhi's power</span> as well as Tsuruya's telling him that he and his friends <em>really</em> need to work on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> better. And then there's just his ignoring Haruhi's feelings for him; over which she's <em>willing to rewrite the whole of reality over.</em> Even Itsuki is starting to get annoyed.
</li><li> Souichi of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre">Boy's Love</a> manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheTyrantFallsInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheTyrantFallsInLove">The Tyrant Falls in Love</a></em> doesn't seem to realize that he's making an awful lot of exceptions to his homophobia in regards to his gay companion Morinaga, not even after he says outright that he doesn't want Morinaga to leave him and that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">he can have sex with Morinaga only</a></em>. That must be one hell of a balancing act between "I hate <em>hate</em> homos!" and "I can't let Morinaga leave my side, even if he likes me <em>that</em> way!" in Souichi's mind.

Aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Haruhi herself</a>, no one else is fooled, and in later volumes the other members of the Host Club speculate that Tamaki subconsciously refuses to acknowledge his feelings for Haruhi because he doesn't want anything to break up the surrogate family he's created in the Host Club the way his parents' love caused his own family to be broken up. The funny thing is, Tamaki's "paternal love" obsession goes a bit far when he realizes he's <em>romantically</em> in love with Haruhi. He thinks of himself as a "perverted lech" preying upon his "daughter" and feels horrified about committing "incest".

</li><li> Satou's very much aware of Takagi's affection for her at least relatively early on, <em>and</em> she definitely reciprocates it. What she <em>isn't</em> aware of is how much nearly every other male detective in her department is crushing on her (well, except for Shiratori, but that was only because she got stuck in an omiai with him), to the point where she never seems really aware why the Absolute Defense Line keeps making things difficult for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">the hapless Takagi</a>.

She's perfectly capable of realizing when Light is fake-dating <em>other</em> girls just to use and manipulate them, but somehow never figures out he's doing the same with her. Admittedly, even if she did know, she still wouldn't care.

Since it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">a very early strip</a> it seems to have been retconned since then, and all later strips show the relationship between England and little America as genuinely warm and fluffy, with little America pretending to enjoy England's cooking even though it's horrible, being happy to receive presents from England, and crying when England goes home.
</li><li> Spain has this, especially in the strip where he proposes to Romano. He merely asked for three meals a day without the slightest hinting to either option, but Spain automatically takes it as rejection.
</li><li> America also fits in this, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that he "refuses to read the atmosphere". In other words, he can literally choose whether to remain oblivious to an event or finally pay attention to it.

</li><li> More recently, Denmark has been hinted to do this as well, ignoring aggressive social behaviour and maintaining a cheery demeanour. He never gets it whenever Norway insults him, and during the 2011 Halloween event, when Belarus throws a hanger at him and declares that Russia's team will win, he simply wished her luck.

This is no doubt due to his atypical upbringing, he probably has no idea HOW to react to such affection. His relationship with Tessa comes to mind, in particular. Numerous times, she makes incredibly aggressive advances on him, which he actually <em>notices</em> enough to feel nervous and scared. However, when people are later referring to her feelings for him, he's shown to react in a very oblivious manner, many times completely dismissing it. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing">his commanding officer</a> so he would have a good reason to do this.

She thinks "Every time Eyeshield 21 shows up... Sena never seems to be around. Maybe they... don't get along well?" The justification is that since she still sees Sena as a little kid who cannot stand up for himself, she simply <em>cannot</em> think of him as a successful football player.

<ul><li> Also, Loki often claims things like "everyone hated me" which is untrue.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JourneyIntoMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JourneyIntoMystery">Loki returned to childhood age</a>, with only those memories, and guess what? He's happy and knows that Thor loves him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">like the little brother he is and cares for Thor in return</a> He also doesn't get why everyone seems to hate him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">since he doesn't remember all the things he did as an adult</a>, which lends credence to the idea that Loki was editing his own self history to make it so he was "always hated" so his excuse held up.
</li><li> Now he does know since many people of Asgard pointed it out for him that his scheme led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">bringing Asgard crashing down</a>. However, they are also unwilling to tell him almost anything else (like who people are, what is happening at the moment, etc), since they still want to off him the second they think Thor won't care. The only exceptions so far seem to be the Warriors Three, who seem to do so very grudgingly (unless the story is funny or makes who Loki used to look bad).
</li><li> Loki is a young adult once more, with their past-selves memories and abilities but their child-selfs morality and sense of right-and-wrong, and in the first issue of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LokiAgentOfAsgard">own series</a> it quickly establishes that at least <em>some</em> part of Loki's past hatred is justified, as Thor admits that he did use to be quite a bully to Loki when they were younger. After he's briefly returned to his previous cruel, alcoholic bullying self, he apologises for making Loki the way they once were, while Loki themself forgives him now that they're both heroes. Cue awws from the audience.

Throughout all of Act V and the first third or so of Act VI, Arial is infatuated with Dark and, no matter how many times it's explicitly pointed out to her that he doesn't love her that way, blindly refuses to accept it until Act VI chapter 27, in which her actions cause Dark to have a mental breakdown that nearly leads to his death; in Ruby's words, not even she and the other members of Tsukune's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> were nearly as stupid and blind over Tsukune as Arial was over Dark.

Even once she does realize it, she fails to understand the sheer magnitude of how much stronger Bardock (Kakarot named his son after his father instead of Gohan) is until Master Roshi points out that she'll likely never catch up to him as Bardock's been training since he could walk and is unlikely to ever stop training to become stronger.

Furthermore, a central plot conflict revolves around Xander changing (rejoining the swim team, applying to college, gaining new friends, etc) and Buffy and Willow refusing to accept that it's not a bad thing. When they try to "support" Xander to "overcome his unhealthy relationship with Cordelia", Xander actually looks up signs of an unhealthy relationship and his relationship with Cordelia only match two criteria: Xander acting different and Cordelia trying to separate him from them. Meanwhile, his friendship with Buffy and Willow meet over half of the criteria that aren't about sexual or parent/child relationships. Faith <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidestThingIveEverHeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidestThingIveEverHeard">laughs her ass off</a> at the idea, noting that Xander and Cordelia have the healthiest relationship she's ever seen.

She played no part in raising him and did not give birth to him, but she is his mother nonetheless. The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maya</span>'s canonically insane may have something to do with this.
</li><li> Hermione Granger focuses heavily on anything she thinks Xander Harris does wrong in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28590-11/Greywizard+Dealing+With+The+Aftermath.htm">Dealing with the Aftermath<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> while completely ignoring the circumstances. Xander drew a gun on McGonnagall? Hermione ignores that she drew a wand on him first, which is also a deadly weapon. She also condemns Xander for killing Fenrir Greyback, despite the man being an unrepentant mass murderer. Probably the biggest though is that Xander shot (and ultimately killed) Dumbledore because the man just attacked Xander's partner with an unknown spell.
</li><li> When Professor (Ale)Xander Harris refers to Professor McGonaggall by her first name in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-23251-7/BarefootXO+Time+and+Again.htm">Time and Again<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Hermione wants to reprimand him but "decides to let it pass this once". She has apparently forgotten that not only do colleagues often refer to each other by their first names but Xander and Minerva are <em>married</em>; of course he's going to call his wife by her first name.
</li><li> In the <em>Frozen</em> fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheAlphabetStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheAlphabetStory">The Alphabet Story</a></em>, Elsa is clearly in love with Kyra however she denies her feelings both to herself and her sister. Same-gender romances are illegal in Arendelle and, even if they weren't, such feelings would be abnormal for a queen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32609-4/Nycorson%2BLove%2Byou%2Bto%2Bthe%2BMoon%2Band%2BBack.htm">Love you to the Moon and Back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Safira is understandably confused that all of the Scoobies except Faith seem to think Xander is some fragile child pretending to be a superhero. Xander admits to making things worse by never admitting that he's the one pulling off various heroic deeds in his reports but only does so because they'll simply refuse to believe it. In his words, if they see him do something amazing, in a week they'll believe it to be a fluke and in a month they'll think someone else did it.
<ul><li> Later chapters reveal their obliviousness is due to magic from when Willow tried to destroy the world forcing Xander's friends to think of him as the Zeppo. While Willow and Buffy are by far the worst, the longer anyone spends with them, the more they'll be affected.

Notably, she continues to call him Xander after the others call him Alexander and gets upset when he does something contrary to her thoughts on what "Xander" should be (such as not wanting him to grow back his beard).

What offends her the most is when either of them implies Tony's molesting her and she doesn't know enough to realize it's wrong, since at that point not only have they never been intimate, but she and Tony are actually starting to fall in love.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheWarIsFarFromOverNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheWarIsFarFromOverNow">The War Is Far from Over Now</a></em>, many of the Avengers that would eventually make up "Team Captain America" (Natasha and Steve in particular) remain completely oblivious to both how much Tony Stark contributes to the group and how incredibly busy he is. Unlike Clint, Natasha, Steve, and Wanda, Tony has a day job: running a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">Fiction 500</a> which any CEO could tell you is not a simple 9 to 5. Though he's since made Pepper CEO, Tony still invents most of their products when he's not improving the Iron-Man suit, organizing relief efforts for areas caught in Avenger business, dealing with the other Avengers' various screw-ups, and building a planetary defense system for the inevitable alien invasions.
<ul><li> Natasha's first impression of Tony Stark was formed when he was dying of palladium poisoning, causing her to view everything he does through the lens of a showboating, irresponsible playboy. For example, she gets upset at Tony's "narcissism" making Sam and Wanda's recruitment into the Avengers a mere footnote in the paper, never considering that as a former member of HYDRA, Wanda should be kept out of the spotlight.
</li><li> Tony's self-esteem issues keep him from realizing that for all intents and purposes, he's the leader of the Avengers. Even though he houses them, handles public relations, and supplies all their gear, Tony only views himself as a "consultant". As a result, he's baffled that everyone from news reporters to the World Security Council contact him for anything regarding the Avengers.

Steve can't understand how Pepper could "abandon her post" when she has an Iron-man suit, even after Rhodey and Pepper both explain that not only does her suit lack the firepower of War Machine, Iron-Man, or Lady Iron (Friday's armor), but she has no combat training and isn't an Avenger anyway. Meanwhile, Steve disparages Jim Paxton who's present as Yellow Jacket, claiming the man has no training and has no business fighting Thanos's forces, ignoring that Jim is a police officer and has more training than Scott, whom Steve has no problem with being in the coming battle.

Besides discouraging Adventurers and non-humans from visiting, they take great pains to make every house identical and change absolutely nothing about the village. When visiting for the first time in two years, Harry and Dudley are disturbed to realize that everything looks exactly the same, including the decorations in store windows.
<ul><li> Later chapters show the Wizarding World is exactly the same, doing their best to ignore how things have irrevocably changed. Perhaps the most ludicrous example is that they continue teaching classes the same way as before "The Transition" even though they know for a fact that wands have a limited amount of magic before they become worthless sticks. Hermione lampshades that they're wasting a non-renewable resource on parlor tricks like turning beetles into buttons.
</li></ul></li><li> Alya and Adrien both exhibit this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheOneToMakeItStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheOneToMakeItStay">The One to Make It Stay</a></em>:
<ul><li> Firstly, Alya refuses to acknowledge that Marinette has any valid reasons to distrust Lila. Even after being presented with proof that she lied about knowing Prince Ali, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">declares that doesn't actually mean anything without proof that she's lying about</a> <em>everything</em>. So far as she's concerned, the only reason Marinette has to dislike Lila is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous">they're both interested in Adrien</a>... even though Marinette's given up on him and has moved on.

When she outright refuses to cooperate, Alya chalks it up to her being nervous and fretting about things not working out, blaming <em>her</em> for those issues — she's just not <em>driven</em> enough! Even when she spells out for her that she's already dating Luka, Alya tries to blow that off as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperationJealousy">Operation: Jealousy</a> rather than a <em>real</em> relationship.
</li><li> Alya also fails to grasp that there was anything suspect about her decision to secretly film Chat Noir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">confessing to Ladybug</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">cutting up and splicing the footage to make it look like she reciprocated</a>. Even when confronted directly by Ladybug, she dismisses her anger and hurt as no big deal, failing to acknowledge that she crossed any lines.
</li><li> Chat Noir, meanwhile, elects to ignore Ladybug's insistence that she just doesn't feel the same way about him. Save for when he's sulking about how <em>unfair</em> she's being, and that she's not treating him like her equal partner... while ignoring that there's nothing 'equal' about him refusing to listen to anything she says that he doesn't like.
</li><li> Of note: Alya eventually acknowledges, during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">her spotlight story</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">I Owe You Every Joy of Love</a></em> and afterwards, that her stubbornness stems from a reluctance to face the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">she was wrong</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">her actions have had dire consequences</a>. Adrien's POV sequences, meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">show no signs of self-doubt</a>, as he continues to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blame everyone else</a>.

In his grief, Membrane chose to forget that aliens existed and refused to think of her as anything other than a human.

Notably, Genma's diary remarks on Ranma being out of shape due to her "flabby chest" rather than acknowledging she's grown a sizeable bust since hitting puberty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BlackbirdArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BlackbirdArrow">Blackbird (Arrow)</a></em>: Quentin and Dinah blame Oliver for inviting Sara on the <em>Gambit</em> and Laurel for dating Oliver in the first place. Neither one seem to realize that Sara <em>chose</em> to get on the boat. Dinah does blame herself for letting Sara go (though she never acknowledges letting Sara sleep with Laurel's boyfriend was wrong), but Quentin doesn't seem to realize yet the role his parenting played in the situation. On top of that, Sara fully acknowledges and accepts her fault in the situation, and has the appropriate guilt to show for it, which makes her parents' obliviousness all the more damning in comparison.

Never mind how many times she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">called out</a>, or how often Marinette stresses that they aren't friends anymore. At most, she only acknowledges her former friend's anger in order to claim that she's blowing things out of proportion, or that she's faking the extent of her outrage in order to punish her.
</li><li> When Chloe and several other classmates explain to Adrien just <em>why</em> Chat Noir's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">persistent pursuit</a> of Ladybug is wrong, he dismisses it as them not really <em>understanding</em> the situation like he does.

</li><li> Tanya never quite realizes just how powerful she is politically nor how much she means to Arthas. Even during the campaign in Northrend, Tanya believes she's working towards securing a comfortable job in Arthas' court once they return to Lordaeron. In reality, not only is Tanya revered as the in-universe equivalent to the Pope (one of her titles is "Her Holiness") and referred to as a living saint, Arthas is actually head over heels in love with her. It's not until he gives her an implied proposal in the final chapter that she finally realizes.

<ul><li> In "Reflekta", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Chloé</a> acts as though she has absolutely no idea what the concept of shame even <em>is</em>... when it comes to being ashamed by her own actions. Adrien's criticism of her behavior draws a completely blank look from her, as if she truly can't fathom what on earth he's talking about. Despite this, she clearly understands the concept of shame when applied to <em>others</em> — as in, how to humiliate the targets of her bullying, <em>and</em> that their emotions could be exploited by Hawkmoth... something she also sees as a good thing, as that 'gives her a chance to show off' as the titular Scarlet Lady.
</li><li> More generally speaking, Chloé's also oblivious to the fact that 'her' Adrikins has been getting increasingly annoyed with her selfish, spoiled and clingy behavior. "Reflekta" also features him being reaching the point that he shoves her off of him when she won't let go of his arm, disrupting the class picture even further. Yet despite said photo capturing the moment of him shoving her away, Chloé dreamily refers to it as 'my picture with Adrien' and is desperate to ensure there's no retake, treating it as evidence of their bond rather than proof of it splintering.

First, they don't understand why Shanks and Buggy don't seem invested in the fact Ace is Roger's son, ignoring that none of them ever told the two Roger even had a child. Second, the Roger Pirates don't grasp why Buggy (and Shanks) has a grudge against them rather than being happy to see them for the first time in 22 years, apparently forgetting that they abandoned Buggy and Shanks in the New World when they were barely teenagers and now targets for Roger's various enemies. Third, when Ace shows more interest in being Luffy's brother than Roger's son, Crocus can't fathom why that matters, even though Ace never met Roger while Luffy is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice">Family of Choice</a>. Not to mention that the people treating Ace as Luffy's brother are actually treating him like a person rather than just "The son of Gol D. Roger".
<ul><li> Later chapters show Crocus thinks of Buggy as a crybaby who's too cowardly to fight anyone even slightly stronger than a civilian, blatantly ignoring that Buggy was a <em>ten year old in the New World</em>, a place where even hardened Grand Line pirates are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> at best.

He encounters a village with two populations, where persons of one population are oblivious to anyone in the other. They dress very differently, so the main character can distinguish between the two.

It was explained by the protagonists that the Ministry suspected Dumbledore of using Voldemort as a scapegoat to explain his own screw-ups at running the school.

Despite that, he throughout the series gains military command, political intrigue, and a taste for fine clothing and drink. It's almost parody when, late in the series, he ends up marrying a foreign princess and him insisting that "just because he married a princess, that didn't mean that he was a bloody noble" with his friends pointing out that not only did that make him a nobleman, it is the <em>very definition</em> of being made nobility.

On the day before Ross's wedding to Emily, she somehow finally figures it out: "Sure, I like Ross, but feelings are really complicated... maybe I <em>am</em> sexually attracted to him, but I <em>do</em> love him... oh my God."

<ul><li> On top of his book counterpart's general refusal to see positive value in his son Tyrion, Tywin Lannister's last <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">living</span> episode has his daughter Cersei send him to <em>immediate</em> denial mode by confirming certain rumors that he was long aware of but never consciously believed. The rumors themselves <em>should</em> have been obvious and indeed were deduced by Ned Stark - specifically that the Baratheons' black hair is nigh-universally dominant, as is the case with all of Robert's bastards, whereas all three of his supposed children by Cersei are blond like the other Lannisters.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cersei</strong>: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course, it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known. <br/><strong>Tywin</strong>: Known what? <br/><strong>Cersei</strong>: Everything they say is true about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Jaime and me</a>. <br/><strong>Tywin</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">No. No, no, no, no...</a>
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Per his actor Charles Dance</a>, the way Tywin sees things is that his son Jaime was "<em>the handsome apple of my eye</em>" while the other two children are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Cersei</a> and Tyrion the whoremongering imp "<em>who, unfortunately, is brighter than the other two put together</em>", so consciously realizing that the rumors were true would have meant admitting to himself that <em>none</em> of his children were okay by his standards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and that all three of Jaime and Cersei's children, nominally sired by Cersei's husband Robert, have no legitimate blood claim to either the Iron Throne or to House Lannister</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Shae's jealousy regarding Tyrion's marriage to Sansa despite Tyrion clearly acting as a protector and not consummating their marriage. The fact she feels Varys and Tyrion are exaggerating how precarious her position is, when any passing knowledge of Tywin and Cersei would inform most this is not the case, is very noticeable. Eventually, this refusal to accept how much danger she's in actually forces Tyrion to make a deliberately horrible speech to drive her away and she seemingly takes it at face value.
</li><li> Though he's shown that he is primarily interested in hunting, whoring, and gambling, Robert is not a stupid man  as evidenced by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> and his occasional status as a royal who actually does something, yet in a world where blood so often makes people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">Colour-Coded for Your Convenience</a> he is unable to see that Joffrey and his other children bear no phenotypical resemblance to the Baratheon family and in fact have traits that are exclusively Lannister. This could possibly be forgiven if it were the case with only one child and coloring was evenly spread amongst his other two children like the Starks, but ALL of his children are blond.

</li><li> A very common theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hoarders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hoarders">Hoarders</a></em>, where people don't seem to notice they're living in squalor. One episode featured a woman who had a lot of dolls. At one point she picks up a small doll that's the size of a soda can and declares that it doesn't take up any space, completely ignoring the <em>8-foot-tall mountain of toys</em> in front of her.

<div class="indent"><strong>Sgt Schultz</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">I see nothing. NOTHING!</a>
</div></li><li> Barney Stinson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> is almost totally self-deluded, not only is he a compulsive liar who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">believes his own lies</a>, he constantly twists his perception of reality to paint himself and his life as "awesome", no matter how pathetic he actually is. For example, he will invent arbitrary social rules to justify his behavior and claim historical precedents for them, and continually insist they are true, despite their obvious falsehood.
<ul><li> This apparently stems from childhood, when Barney's mother chose to lie to Barney and conceal from him anything that might damage his sense of self-worth. For example, when no one came to his birthday party, she forged a letter from the Postmaster General, claiming he had lost all the invitations. This made Barney unable to accept anything that might damage his overinflated ego. Once, when he amicably broke up with Wendy the Waitress, he chose to believe she had gone crazy and was trying to murder him, rather than face the fact she simply didn't mind not being with him.
</li><li> Everything you need to know about Barney can be seen in an episode in the sixth season, Zoe sets Ted up with her attractive cousin "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Honey</a>", and Robin and Barney both relate their own versions of the date to Marshall; in Robin's presumably more truthful account, Honey is fascinated by Ted and blatantly flirts with him, while Barney desperately attempts to hit on her and she politely ignores him. While eventually, Barney does leave with her, it's only because Ted is much more interested in Zoe and lets him; in Barney's version, Ted bores Honey by droning endlessly about architecture, and she is virtually ripping off Barney's clothes the whole time. When Marshall points out the difference in the accounts, Barney angrily insists his is true.
</li><li> The entire group is guilty of this and later seasons have them confront this as part of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Barney finally acknowledges that Bob Barker is not his father and actually seeks out his real dad. Ted and Robin realize that they do not have a future as a couple and that by remaining roommates they stifle any chance of having serious romantic relationships with others.

</li><li>Dee refuses to admit the fact that she is a terrible actress and is a rude, crude, and white trash alcoholic waitress.
</li><li>Mac is probably the biggest example of this trope. He refuses to acknowledge the fact that his mother couldn't care less about him, he is terrible at karate, he isn't a badass, his friends openly despise him, and that he isn't as devote as he believes himself to be.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em>, Gillian readily accepts her husband's feeble excuses about having to work late, even though her job is based around the ability to tell instantly when someone is lying.

Polly calls both him and Grace out on it, informing the latter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> on her wedding day</span> that even if Tommy has chosen to forgive Grace, the rest of the family have not forgiven or forgotten what she did and it's only because they love Tommy they're willing to pretend for his sake, with the implicit threat that if she ever tries it again, Polly will deal with her.
</li><li> Guy of Gisborne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> chooses to ignore the mounting evidence that Marian is in cahoots with Robin Hood.

His imagined friendship with Captain Sisko escalates to ridiculous levels throughout the series, to the point where he chides Sisko for being so obtuse about his feelings while on the opposite sides of a battle line or in the middle of a no-holds-barred hand-to-hand fight. In fact, you could probably form a whole section on all the things Dukat pointedly ignores. (Although, from what little has been revealed of the Cardassians, that may be how they express friendship, or he may be doing it just to annoy Sisko.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangersWithCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangersWithCandy">Strangers with Candy</a></em>, the homophobic Principal Blackman is the only one who doesn't know that Chuck and Geoffrey are lovers.

While she may view Damon as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a>, Damon has done actions that cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> to her friends including trying to kill Caroline and Bonnie, killing her brother Jeremy (he got better), killing Lexi, turning Vicki into a vampire who had to be staked, and forcibly turning Bonnie's mother into a vampire. Basically, even if you ignore the large number of random people he's killed and continues to kill when he's in a bad mood, he's done enough to the people Elena is supposed to care about that her fondness for him requires mountains of this trope.

If you accepted that all these characters' stories are true, even though they clearly contradict each other, they'd go insane. Also tends to be a vital tactic in other areas of roleplay: text-based combat (rather than in-engine PVP) oftentimes breaks down into "Bang bang! / OH I dodged! / No, I shot you / no you didn't!" levels of quarrels; Selective Obliviousness is oftentimes the only way to resolve a situation before ending up needing to get mods involved.

Taking the worse factor a step further, in "Vicky Gets Fired", Timmy shows his parents incriminating evidence of Vicky torturing him, but they don't even bat an eye. In fact, they only get upset at Vicky and fire her because she erased their reality tape. Even Timmy, their own son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Fluttershy</a>'s introverted tendencies throughout her life result in a tremendous lack of self-awareness, to the point that she considers herself "a loudmouth". In "Putting Your Hoof Down," this carries over into her resolve to stop being such a pushover (a status which she needed her friends' objective input to realize), causing her to fail to notice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">how she's been acting</a> until she notices <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">how monstrous her reflection has become</a>.
</li><li> Scootaloo is stubbornly oblivious to the fact that acquiring a cutie mark actually <em>requires</em> personal introspection and self-discovery, instead simply trying whatever random activity or skill she can think of in hopes that this will prove to be her special talent. The other two Cutie Mark Crusaders, Applebloom and Sweetie Belle, follow her lead.
</li><li> Pinkie isn't fond of Mudbriar's stoic attitude and mannerisms, despite her sister Maud's own personality being similar to his. Case in point, when Maud and Mudbriar take out their pets to play, they marvel at the fun they have together. Pinkie, however, whispers to Maud that Twiggy is just a stick even though Boulder itself is just a rock. When Starlight points this out to her, Pinkie retorts that Boulder has "ten times the personality of some random stick!" Similarly, Pinkie thinks Starlight is joking when she points out that Maud is undeniably awkward and strange just as Mudbriar is.

<div class="indent"><strong>Peggy</strong>: Let's see there's the popular kids, the jocks, the nerds, and then there's us. <br/><strong>Helga</strong>: Hey don't lump me in with you losers.

<ul><li> SpongeBob not only completely ignores the words of warning a gypsy woman gives him about the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em>-like creatures she sells, but also ignores when it turns into a massive killer eel in favor of chastising Gary for "bullying" it even when <em>he is in its mouth and about to be eaten</em>.
</li><li> What <em>really</em> sells SpongeBob (ditto for Patrick) as this is the fact that he just <em>cannot</em> seem to comprehend the obvious fact that not only is Squidward not his best friend, but in fact hates him to the point of madness, even though Squidward has flat-out told SpongeBob to his face that he can't stand him on at least one occasion. This is best shown in "Little Yellow Book," where we're shown a scene of Squidward chewing SpongeBob out; while in reality, Squidward was furious at SpongeBob for letting Gary into his home and Gary chewing up many of his possessions, complete with Squidward screaming "horrible words that should never be used around strangers" in his face, SpongeBob sees it as Squidward giving him "his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet."
<div class="indent"><strong>Squidward</strong>: Great Neptune, I had no idea. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">The depth of his delusion is awe-inspiring.</a>
</div></li><li> Squidward is oblivious to the fact that he's not that good a clarinet player. It's implied that even SpongeBob knows it, but doesn't have the heart to tell him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode Lois' brother, Patrick, is revealed to be the eponymous Fat Guy Strangler. Lois refuses to believe Patrick is the killer, despite the several glaring pieces of evidence that point to Patrick, including a half dead fat guy lying in Patrick's room who outright states that Patrick tried to kill him, until Lois sees more and more damning evidence piling up and Brian screaming at her to wake up.
</li><li> The Griffins, except for the children and Brian, never seem to be aware that Stewie is highly intelligent for a baby his age. Every time he talks they never exactly react to what he says. In the episode "The Courtship of Stewie's Father", Lois meets with Stewie's preschool teacher and she shows Lois several drawings Stewie made, which show Stewie killing Lois in various horrible ways. The two women then have this exchange regarding the images:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Teacher</strong>: Notice anything unusual in these pictures? <br/><strong>Lois</strong>: You're right, his father isn't in any of them!

<ul><li> Zim himself is completely incapable of processing any evidence that he's <em>not</em> a great hero of the Irken Empire. No matter how much he destroys on his own side, how blatant the Tallests' contempt for him is, or how obviously they try to get rid of him, he always bounces back just as convinced of his own greatness as before. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He realizes that the Tallest aren't coming for him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</a></em>... for a few minutes before he rationalizes it away and is back to his old self.</span>
</li><li> Dib, Zim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, believes that exposing Zim as an alien will change how his family and peers think of him, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the above mentioned movie, at least his family shows they care about him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>:
<ul><li> Professor Hamilton worked with the Cadmus project and attempted to take down the Justice League all because of Superman's invasion of Earth while he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> and subsequently threatening him, referring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E12E13Legacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E12E13Legacy">the events of the finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a>.</em> While that is true that Superman threatened him, it's only because Hamilton was being a total prick and refusing to help him save a badly wounded Supergirl because he was more concerned about saving his own ass by not consorting with someone who was considered a felon rather than helping a man he'd repeatedly given aid to in the past no matter the circumstance.
</li><li> Superman falls prey to this exact same trope in the same Cadmus storyline. Despite later giving his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a> in a different episode, at no point does Superman apologize to Hamilton or acknowledge that a human might have panicked at the reminder that his friend is an immortal alien with laser beam eyes. It later takes Green Arrow AND the Flash to point out that to most people, the difference between a Kryptonian superhero and a Kryptonian alien monster is a matter of how careful the Kryptonian is about damaging things. Like relationships, buildings, and people.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eric Cartman is so wrapped up in his own ginormous ego that he will ignore everything that contradicts his glorified self-image, and what he cannot ignore he will twist in his own favor. The best example is, of course, claiming he's not fat, but "big boned", but there are other examples too. On one occasion he frantically strives to avoid a fight with a girl who's mad at him, because if he loses, nobody will think he's cool anymore. When he's forced to fight anyway and loses, the other kids tell him that not only did they <em>never</em> think he was cool, but they can't possibly think any lower of him than they did before. He thinks that they're just saying it to make him feel better, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">meaning they care about him, meaning they STILL think he's cool</a>.
</li><li> "Asspen" finds Stan spell out that he is uninterested in competing with the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> of the ski resort, only for the latter to take every single word as a challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> often uses selective obliviousness, especially to facts that damage his ego. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> told in an interview that when they first thought up Daffy's voice everyone was sure that they would be fired when their producer Leon Schlesinger would hear it because he would probably immediately realize that Daffy's lisp was based on his own. Strange enough Schlesinger never noticed this and even complimented the staff on creating such a wonderfully unique voice!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky Pig</a> exhibits this at times. He refuses to believe in Daffy's imaginary friend, even when he is being carried in his invisible pouch. He will also never heed the warnings of danger from Sylvester, not even when a monster is looking him square in the eye (that tall green Martian is <em>obviously</em> a friendly Native American).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo">Mr. Magoo</a></em> not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMistake">can't see past the end of his nose</a>, but more to the point, refuses to acknowledge that there's something wrong with his eyesight. Even when he's told he's mistaken, he either misunderstands or dismisses it, stubbornly sticking to his guns rather than admit he's wrong. Only in two cartoons ("Fuddy Duddy Buddy", where he's told that he's mistaken a walrus for his old friend Bottomley; and "Magoo's Check-up", where's he's flat out told to get his eyes checked) is he confronted with the reality of his nearsightedness, and yet both times he pulls himself up and continues on as always (he takes the walrus out again because he genuinely likes his company, and he mistakes a TV repair shop for the ophthalmologist's office and thinks he's been given a clean bill of health). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that even if he did wear glasses, as bullheaded as he is, he would still make the same kind of blatant mistakes.
<ul><li> Interesting bit of trivia, there actually is an extremely rare condition in real life that causes people who are blind to think that they can see. Is called AntonBabinski syndrome or Anton's Blindness. People with this condition can't be convinced that they are blind despite any evidence.
