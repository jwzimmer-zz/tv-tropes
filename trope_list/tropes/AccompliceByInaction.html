<ul><li> Following the Kamino Ward Incident, during which five of Class A's students provide a small, but critical moment of aid in the rescue of a kidnapped classmate, Class A's teacher Aizawa takes them to task afterward for going off on their own and against instructions. He berates not just the five who went out, but the rest of the class who were fully aware of what they were planning and did nothing to stop them beyond futile attempts at persuading them not to go.

It later turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Overhaul has been submitting Eri to horrific abuse, using her body to create bullets capable of destroying people's Quirks</span>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, Ari of Arkhanta, who possesses a slave he uses only for his greedy motives, has a massive grudge against the oracle of Kandrakhar, the benevolent figure who saves everyone's life once a week. Why? Unlike the man, who obsessed about changing his son, the Oracle didn't ever try to "cure" the child's autism.
</li><li> This is the main motivation of "Public Enemy" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel2099">Marvel 2099</a></em> verse. A genetically-engineered super soldier, he bears a grudge against the corporation Alchemax for murdering his parents. Even after tracking down and killing everyone involved in the Red Dog project, he still feels like the really guilty party hasn't been punished. He then witnesses a crazed gunman about to kill a woman, while dozens of pedestrians either ignore it or talk about what a shame it is. After rescuing her, a crowd of people gather around him to tell him what a hero he was. Incensed at their inaction, he murders them all on the spot. He realizes that who he truly hates are the public who allow bad things to happen while claiming innocence. He kills more crowds of people who were witnesses to crimes and did nothing to stop them, eventually coming into conflict with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher2099">The Punisher</a>. During a battle between the two, he's surrounded by a crowd of people who were related to his victims. They all attack him with bricks, pipes, and whatever else they have on hand. As the crowd swarms him, Public Enemy yells out encouragement to them, overjoyed that they're finally doing what he wanted them to do even as they tear him apart.
</li><li> This was part of a <em>very</em> large plotline in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> comics, involving Tombstone and <em>Daily Bugle</em> editor Joe Robinson. Tombstone had bullied Joe when they were kids, and eventually, Joe witnessed Tombstone - now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">hitman working for the Kingpin</a> kill a man, and after the thug threatened him, he kept quiet for decades. In the present time, Joe finally came forward when the Kingpin used the assassin in a <em>failed</em> attempt at Spidey, but Joe was arrested and convicted of withholding evidence. (In truth, both the DA and judge were bought by the Kingpin; this led to another storyline where Tombstone attempted to gain revenge on him in prison, which eventually ended in Joe gaining a Presidential pardon; still, the issue with Tombstone lasted much longer...)
<ul><li> A variation of this trope in his origin story — standing by idly as the burglar who later would murder Uncle Ben escaped — of course continues to be the driving motivation for Spider-Man himself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersLastStandOfTheWreckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersLastStandOfTheWreckers">The Transformers: Last Stand of the Wreckers</a></em>: Invoked when Squadron X were killed. The Decepticons were all arrested, but because it was on a neutral world they couldn't be held. Impactor took a gun, locked himself in and shot them all to death. All the Wreckers stood by except Springer who tried to stop him (but couldn't as he was injured) and let him. Afterward they confessed to Springer that they were too stunned or scared to stop him, and had fallen under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Bystander Syndrome</a>.

Even years later he still holds a grudge against the Crowders even though the remaining members of the family had no role in the matter.
<ul><li> Ava Crowder was abused for years by her husband Bowman until she finally had enough and shot him dead. All the locals knew what was happening and have no real problem with what she did since they feel that Bowman deserved what happened to him. However, when they try to express this sentiment to her she rebukes them because none of them tried to help her when she was abused so their words mean nothing to her. The only one to apologize for his inaction is Bowman's brother Boyd and Ava forgives him after he risks his own life to save her from his father Bo Crowder.

As a result Limehouse now has a network of grateful women who provide him with information on all the important things happening in the region.

Within three hours, the clinic was full. However, unbeknownst to Musinga, it was a trap. The police returned and slaughtered the Tutsi.

<ul><li> One of the unsubs in the episode "The Perfect Storm" had an abusive father and brother. When the police finally got involved, the mother covered for them, claiming the unsub was lying about the abuse. The person the unsub blames most is, of course, the <em>mother</em> for enabling the abuse, not the father and brother for actually enacting it.

Thus, his rage is targeted towards American families (with particular hatred for the father figures).
</li><li> One episode had an unsub going after the bullies who drove his friend to suicide in high school. Well, one of the bullies, and also the parents of the girlfriend of another bully (he was out of town), and also the principal who he felt didn't do enough to remedy the situation, and also a substitute teacher who <em>did</em> help break up a prank, but apparently not well enough.
</li><li> The unsub in "Elephant's Memory" targets his revenge attacks at the actual people who he feels actively harmed him (the football team who bullied him, his negligent father, and his girlfriend's abusive father). It's Reid who insists on assigning responsibility on those who could have stepped in sooner, but didn't. He outright tells a room full of police officers that they could have prevented his murder spree.

Eric then confeses that he smashed the dioram because he was jealous of how much better hers was. Hyde then starts blaming Eric for how he has been treated by everynone, saying that he was pegged as a troublemaker because Eric just stood by while their teacher yelled at him for something he didn't do.

The reason for it is because everyone knows that the sentence for adultery is burning at the stake, and no one, least of all Arthur, wants to see the two killed. As a result, the affair becomes something of an open secret, with everyone refraining from pressing the matter. When Mordred and Agravaine bring the matter to Arthur, not only are their brothers angry with them for drawing attention to the issue, but Arthur says that he won't help or hinder them in their efforts to prove the adultery (though he does openly admit he hopes Lancelot will kill all their witnesses).

<ul><li> Duty to rescue falls under two broad categories. The first category is when the person in question created the dangerous situation that someone else needs to be saved from, they're responsible for doing so. The second is that people who are considered to be responsible for others (parents, the captain of a ship or airplane, an employer, a property owner who invites someone onto their property, and in many places, spouses) are required to rescue those they are responsible for.

Wretched woman! Do you say you did not do it? Then I reply, your husband did, and you approved the deedand the very letter you sent me shows that your heart approves it all. Shame on you."

For those wondering why she considers the Dutch her enemies, it is because the (mostly Dutch) UN Peacekeepers tasked with protecting Srebrenica abandoned their checkpoints and allowed the Serbs to massacre the population.

</li><li> This is what doomed Erwin Rommel following the failed July 20 plot. Historians still differ as to his exact role, but at the very least, he knew about the plot and did nothing to stop it.
<ul><li> And on the topic of Nazi Germany, there's the famous "First they came..." quote.
<div class="indent"><strong>Martin Niemöller</strong>: "First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out - because I was not a Socialist.
