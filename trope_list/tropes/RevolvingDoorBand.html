<p>This is when a band becomes notable for a constantly changing lineup, with musicians coming, staying for only a few years (or, sometimes, even less than a year) and then leaving—essentially, the musical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorCasting">Revolving Door Casting</a>.

All but one (Fakir) either died or became too ill to stay with the band (and later died) and were replaced (they were even a trio for a while); one of the replacements (Theo Peoples) left in 2011 and was himself replaced. <em>But</em> these changes happened <em>years</em> apart: they were Stubbs, Benson, and Fakir from 1997 to 1998 (when Peoples joined); Stubbs, Benson, Fakir, and Peoples from 1998 to 2000 (when Stubbs suffered a stroke and was replaced by Ronnie McNeir), McNeir, Benson, Fakir, and Peoples from 2000-2005 (when Benson died and was replaced by Roquel Peyton, Lawrence's son), and McNeir, Peyton Jr., Fakir, and Peoples from 2005-2011 (when Peoples left and was replaced by Harold "Spike" Bonhart).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a> has had 12 members since 1976, but the only consistent member has been lead singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Robert Smith</a>. The longest-serving member after Smith, bassist Simon Gallup, joined in 1979 and is still a member today, but even he was out of the band for three years in the mid-'80s.
<ul><li> This might not sound a lot, but pretty much all of their thirteen albums have an entirely different mix of members, past and present, performing on it. Additionally, there are multiple instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">former members returning to the lineup</a>. Apart from Gallup, keyboardist Roger O'Donnell and co-founding guitarist Porl Thompson have returned to the band for long stretches after some time away.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall">The Fall</a> were well known for line-up changes, the only constant being Mark E Smith, who once said of the ever-changing line-up "if it's me and your granny on bongos, it's a Fall gig."
<ul><li> British journalist Dave Simpson wrote a book, <em>The Fallen: Life In and Out of Britain's Most Insane Group</em>, about trying to find all of the ex-members (there were fifty). That said, the dynamic duo of Craig Scanlon and Steve Hanley held down the fort from 1979 'til 1995, which is <em>damn</em> impressive. Not coincidentally, they're also the only members of the band that Smith has ever regretted firing (he asked them both come back at different points, and both declined).
</li><li> For a band so famous for its lineup changes, The Fall's membership was relatively stable in its last decade. The band recorded five albums with the same lineup between 2008 and 2015, the most in its history. Until keyboardist Elena Poulou left the group in 2016, the band was on its longest unchanged lineup in its history.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> admits that he was afraid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> were becoming this. (all the first four albums have different line-ups and two bandmembers didn't even play in any of those - William Goldsmith had his drum tracks on <em>The Colour and the Shape</em> replaced with Grohl's ones, and guitarist Franz Stahl left after the tour for that album was finished) But since then, the only change has been an extra member.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a>, partly due to the fact that they are an animated band, have taken advantage of this trope for its real-life line-up. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to this group, due to him being the creator and musical director of the band.
</li><li> James have had somewhat of a revolving door lineup; Glennie, Gilbertson, and Whelan were first up, then Booth came in, Gilbertson left, Gott came in, Whelan left, Baynton-Power came in, Davies, Diagram and Hunter came in, Diagram left, Gott left, Kulas and Oxxal came in, Booth left, Booth came back, Booth left, <em>everyone</em> left, Glennie and Gott <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">restarted the band six years later</a>, Booth came back, then finally Baynton-Power, Davies, Diagram and Hunter all came back (yes, that does make a lineup that already happened at one point). Jim Glennie—the bassist—is the only relatively constant member.
</li><li> Despite only being together for five years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jellyfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jellyfish">Jellyfish</a> only retained lead singer/drummer Andy Sturmer and vocalist-keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., probably not coincidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">the sole creative forces in the band</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> went through several drummers (including Chad Channing) in the span of only a few years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> joined the band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrimalScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrimalScream">Primal Scream</a>, apart from singer Bobby Gillespie. The band was formed by Gillespie and guitarist Jim Beattie, with a number of other members in their early years. Guitarist Andrew Innes arrived too late for the first two singles but has remained in the band ever since he joined it in 1987, and has been its principal songwriter with Gillespie over the course of the band's 11 albums (Beattie left after the unsuccessful first LP, for which he and Gillespie received sole songwriting credits). Keyboardist Martin Duffy has also been a relatively constant, having been there since 1989. Aside from those three core members, however, the group has had more than 20 members, including bass guitarists Mani of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStoneRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStoneRoses">The Stone Roses</a> and Debbie Googe of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyBloodyValentine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyBloodyValentine">My Bloody Valentine</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. 14 members in over 30 years, and only briefly did the band tour with more than 4 members. Although, in all fairness, two of the four members (Anthony Kiedis and Flea) were founding members who never left<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vdcy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vdcy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vdcy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, except for a few months in the late 1980s when Anthony Kiedis was fired from the band</span>. And current drummer Chad Smith has played with the band since 1989.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>. Not so much the first line-up, which only had a couple changes (drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was fired in 1996 and returned in 1999. The same year, bassist D'Arcy Wretzky left the band and was replaced by Melissa Auf der Maur). The second incarnation on the other hand? Upon the band's 2006 reunion, it had a completely different lineup from the original apart from Chamberlin and frontman Billy Corgan. And then by the time they released their next album <em>Oceania</em> in 2010, everyone but Corgan and guitarist Jeff Schroeder had been replaced. The entire band lineup had changed <em>again</em> by the time they released <em>Monuments to an Elegy</em> just two years later, with Corgan and Schroeder once again the only returnees. Currently, the band is comprised of Corgan, Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlain (who rejoined in 2015), and James Iha (another original member, who returned after an 18-year absence in 2018).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSistersOfMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSistersOfMercy">The Sisters of Mercy</a>; Andrew Eldritch is notoriously hard to work with, and he's the only original member left. One other member, Doktor Avalanche, is credited on all of their albums, but it's actually a drum machine and not a human being (and Eldritch kept replacing that drum machine, too).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakingBackSunday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakingBackSunday">Taking Back Sunday</a> started off with Antonio Longo (vocals) John Nolan (vocals/guitar) Eddie Reyes (guitar) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrandNew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrandNew">Jesse Lacey</a> (bass) and Stephen DeJoseph (Drums) By their first album, Lacey, Longo and DeJoseph had left and were replaced by Adam Lazzara (vocals), Shaun Cooper (bass) and Mark O'Connell (drums). <em>After Tell All Your Friends</em> (2002) Nolan and Cooper departed to form Straylight Run and were replaced by Fred Mascherino (vocals/guitar) and Matt Rubano (bass) this line up lasted a lengthy (by TBS standards) two albums before Mascherino left after <em>Louder Now</em>, eventually being replaced by Matt Fazzi for <em>New Again</em>. Following <em>New Again</em>. Fazzi and Rubano departed and Nolan and Cooper rejoined, restoring the band to its breakthrough line-up for its past three albums.
</li><li> When drummer/singer Aaron Gillespie left in 2010, it left <em>no</em> original members remaining in the Christian metalcore band Underoath. Between 1999 and 2003, <em>every</em> original member except for Gillespie quit the band. The band reunited in 2015 with their best-known lineup, but that means Gillespie is once again the only original member.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wedlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wedlock">Wedlock</a>, Apart from Paul Allgood, has featured a different line up on each of its releases. For a band called Wedlock, there's a lot of musical divorce(10 member changes and counting?) going around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wilco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wilco">Wilco</a> changed members several times in its first decade, with singer/guitarist/frontman Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt the only constants. Since 2004, the band's lineup has been relatively stable, and the current six-piece lineup now counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineUp">Long-Runner Line-up</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">     Country </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Asleep at the Wheel. Ray Benson is the only original member.
</li><li> Blackhawk was founded by Henry Paul (lead vocal/mandolin), Van Stephenson (guitar) and Dave Robbins (keyboards). After Van Stephenson left due to skin cancer, he was replaced by Randy Threet (who was previously in their backing band), then Anthony Crawford, then Michael Randall. Robbins left and John Coleman replaced him. Threet rejoined. Coleman left. The backing band got assumed into the main lineup. Robbins rejoined. The backing band was made separate again, leaving just the duo of Paul and Robbins. Is your head spinning yet?
</li><li> Dave &amp; Sugar consisted of lead singer Dave Rowland and a revolving door of female backing vocalists, some of whom sometimes shared the lead vocal.
</li><li> Exile's shift from pop-rock to country started in 1980, around the time original lead singer Jimmy Stokley was replaced by Les Taylor. Taylor and founding member J.P. Pennington both left for unsuccessful solo careers in 1990, with Paul Martin taking over as lead vocalist, and the group disbanded in 1993. Many of the 1980s members, including Taylor, rejoined in 1996. Meanwhile, many of the backing musicians shifted as well, with a few even breaking out on their own. Most notably, Mark Gray had four Top 10 country hits in the mid-'80s and wrote number-one hits for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama">Alabama</a>, Janie Fricke, and Gary Morris.
</li><li> Highway 101 also had a hard time sticking to one lineup. The lead singer post alone went from Paulette Carlson to Nikki Nelson, <em>back</em> to Carlson, then Chrislynn Lee for a short time — and then back to Nelson again.
</li><li> Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Jimmie Fadden and Jeff Hanna are the only remaining original members.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a> originally played this straight. The group formed all the way back in 1947 and had had several members pass through their ranks from their until the most familiar lineup (lead singer Duane Allen, tenor Joe Bonsall, baritone William Lee Golden, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BassoProfundo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BassoProfundo">Basso Profundo</a> Richard Sterban) came to be in 1973. That's long enough into their existence that one of those members (Bonsall) wasn't even alive when the band originally formed. Golden was replaced by Steve Sanders from 1987 to 1995 when he returned.
</li><li> The only consistent members of 1990s country band Ricochet have been lead singer Heath Wright and bassist Greg Cook.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a> had a hard time keeping its members together after Marty Raybon left. They disbanded for a while and came back with a couple original members and Brent Lamb as lead vocalist. After him, it was Curtis Wright, Jimmy Yeary, and ultimately Doug Stokes before Raybon rejoined in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.
</li><li> Vince Vance &amp; the Valiants. There have been literally dozens of Valiants, including the aforementioned Chrislynn Lee. Amusingly, one of said Valiants (Lisa Layne) got the lead on their most well-known song, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a> song).

<ul><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAssociation">The Association</a> went through well over <em>three dozen</em> lineup changes since they formed in 1965. Their longest-lasting lineup was Russ Giguere, Larry Ramos, Bruce Pictor, Donni Gougeon, and Bob Werner (1999 - 2007); In that lineup, Giguere was the only remaining original member and Ramos was the only other member who had been part of their classic 1960s lineups. Not one member has stayed during the band's full duration. As of 2017, the band currently has two classic members in its lineup and they're a completely different duo: Jim Yester and Jules Alexander.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FairportConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FairportConvention">Fairport Convention</a> has had almost 30 members. None have been with the band for its entire 50-year career, and only a couple have been members for more than half of its existence. For example, the band's two most famous members, singer Sandy Denny and guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson">Richard Thompson</a>, were both gone by 1971. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ivt8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ivt8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ivt8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Denny would return in 1974 but would be gone again in a year. Although Thompson hasn't been a member since 1971, he's continued to be associated with the band, and occasionally appears as a guest on their albums and at their concerts.</span> Several musicians were Fairport members for less than a year. Even the band's only more-or-less constant member, guitarist Simon Nicol, left the band for a period (1971 to 1976) before returning. Bassist Dave Pegg has remained with the band since he joined it in 1969, but unlike Nicol, he wasn't an original member.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteeleyeSpan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteeleyeSpan">Steeleye Span</a> has gone through <a class="urllink" href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~zierke/steeleye.span/musicians.html">sixteen different lineups<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> since 1970, involving 16 individual musicians, most of whom have left and returned at least once over the course of the group's existence. Lead singer Maddy Prior was the group's only constant member until she left in 1997, leaving the band with no original members until she returned in 2002.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNewChristyMinstrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNewChristyMinstrels">The New Christy Minstrels</a> had a more-or-less constant turnover in membership during their '60s heyday. Among the musicians who did time in the group were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers">Kenny Rogers</a>, Gene Clark (later a founding member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a>), Barry McGuire (known for his 1965 solo hit "Eve of Destruction"), and Kim Carnes (known for her 1981 solo hit "Bette Davis Eyes").
</li><li> Battlefield Band has had at least two dozen members over its fifty-year history, many of whom such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMcNeill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMcNeill">Brian McNeill</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KarinePolwart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KarinePolwart">Karine Polwart</a> have gone on to solo careers. Current fiddler Alasdair White grew up listening to the group before joining at eighteen.

<ul><li> The Blackwood Brothers. While it's no surprise that the entire original lineup has been replaced after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">76 years</a>, no single lineup seems to have lasted more than a few years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a> (see above) definitely fit this during their gospel years.
</li><li> This is actually a staple of pretty much any gospel quartet, and most trios. It even affects family groups, though not to the same extent. In fact, it's more surprising to encounter a gospel group that has never changed its line-up (really the Triumphant Quartet was about the only one that has literally never had a member change, and even they lost their pianist) is more noteworthy than the many who have. In fact, it's rather incredible for a long-running group to hold on to <em>any</em> of its founding members, but those who do usually end up being defined by those members to the point that if they leave (or die), fans decide the band has ended its run, even if the other members decide to keep going.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haven_of_Rest#Haven_Quartet">The Haven of Rest Quartet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (later Haven Quartet, then finally just Haven) has lasted from 1934 to shortly after the turn of the new millennium. Ernie Payne, the last of the original line-up, finally left the quartet during by 1975 - to be replaced with Glenn Shoemaker. Soon afterward, Walt Harrah (who would remain with the quartet for the rest of its duration, with occasional haituses) joined. The style has changed, too. After only two pipe organists from its inception, by 1984, the electric keyboard became the principle instrument - often with musicians on other instruments, including percussion.

<ul><li> The Sun Ra Arkestra. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunRa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunRa">Sun Ra</a> would fire a musician by gathering the band together — minus the fired musician — and skip town, leaving the offending musician behind. He would even do this on international tours, which made him a major headache for the U.S. State Department — they finally demanded that if he fired a musician, to bring or send said musician back to the United States instead of <em>leaving him stranded in a foreign country</em>.
</li><li> There have been over <em>100</em> members of the Grammy-winning jazz-rock band Blood, Sweat and Tears since their formation in 1968. Seven of the "original eight" members (including famed former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> sideman Al Kooper) were gone by 1974. The eighth, drummer Bobby Colomby, stopped playing with the band in 1977. He still maintains ownership of the name and acts as the band's musical director. The band's only relatively consistent member, lead singer David Clayton-Thomas, joined the band during the recording of their second album and was in and out of the band a few times before leaving for good in 2004.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourFreshmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourFreshmen">The Four Freshmen</a> have had 25 musicians in 24 different lineups since their inception in 1948.
</li><li> Throughout its 15-year history, Weather Report went through 4 bassists and at least 20 drummers and percussionists. The only constants were keyboardist Joe Zawinul and saxophonist Wayne Shorter.
</li><li> This was the entire point of the hard bop combo The Jazz Messengers after drummer Art Blakey took over leadership. Blakey would recruit promising young musicians into the Messengers—then after a few years, they'd leave to start their own solo careers, and Blakey would find more youngsters to replace them. The Messengers were active from 1954 to 1990, with over 60 different members across that time, Art Blakey being the only constant.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CradleOfFilth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CradleOfFilth">Cradle of Filth</a>. The longest-lasting lineup lasted only two years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Dani Filth is the only constant member.</a>

The founding duo split up before recording their first album; the remaining founder member lasted until the end of <em>side one</em> of the band's debut album before leaving, at which point the entire band had been replaced. The only bandmember who appeared on both sides of the group's debut album was blast-beat drummer Mick Harris, who left two albums later, at which point the entire band had been replaced <em>again</em>. They did eventually stabilize, with the current lineup of Barney Greenway, Mitch Harris, Shane Embury, and Danny Herrera having been around for some time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth">Iced Earth</a> was formed in 1984 as "The Rose" by Jon Schaffer in his home state of Indiana. When Jon moved to Tampa Florida a few months later, none of the other members could come with him, so the band broke up, but Schaffer retained the logo font and songs he had written. After moving to Tampa, Schaffer placed an ad for musicians there and met drummer Greg Seymour and vocalist Gene Adam who would remain for the next few years, calling the band "Purgatory". The rest of the band formed soon after, recording some demo tapes and playing many live shows. The band then changed their name to "Purgatory 60" to distinguish themselves from another band. In 1987, lead guitarist Randall Shawver joined and markedly changed the sound of the band from a horror thrash band to one with more distinct prog, NWOBHM, and gothic influences, which led them to drop most of their old songs. In 1988 the band changed their name to Iced Earth before getting a record deal. Seymour left after their first professionally recorded demo tape, Enter The Realm. Adam was fired after the first album and the band's second vocalist John Greely was only in the band for a year before they went on hiatus. There were numerous other lineup changes, however the band finally got a pretty solid lineup when they reformed in 1995 with Matt Barlow on vocals, which endured for the next few albums. There have been numerous other lineup changes over the years, and the current lineup of Iced Earth includes no original members apart from Schaffer. However, drummer Brent Smedley has been in the band on and off since 1997, and current vocalist Stu Block is loyal to the band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>, as the documentary <em>The Early Days, Part 1</em> has shown. There were many line-up changes before the first album in a 5-years span. After their first album, the band began to slowly stabilize - their first four records all have different line-ups, but the addition of Nicko McBrain in <em>Piece Of Mind</em> solidified the band's classic lineup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a>, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, Steve Harris and McBrain, and though Smith left between 1990-1999 and Dickinson from 1993-1999, the lineup reformed in 1999 for <em>Brave New World</em>, retaining Smith's replacement Janick Gers as third guitarist. This six-man lineup remains as of 2018.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> - it doesn't get called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">"Megadave"</a> for nothing. The only original member besides Dave Mustaine is bassist Dave Ellefson, and even he hasn't been in the band constantly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Therion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Therion">Therion</a> consists of Christofer Johnsson and whoever he's convinced to work with him on the latest album. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therion_(band)#Members">See for yourself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> bands are constantly switching line-ups.
<ul><li> Controversial group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> went through so many line-up changes in its first almost-decade of existence that by 1993, when Euronymous was stabbed to death by Count Grishnakh during the recording of <em>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</em>, the former was the only founding member still in the band and the latter was the third bassist; Attila Csihar, the fifth vocalist, would only return to the band a decade later. Mayhem's line-ups have been relatively stable since it reformed in 1995, though it has had five different guitarists since Euronymous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorgoroth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorgoroth">Gorgoroth</a> are also an example.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> example: Although <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nachtmystium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nachtmystium">Nachtmystium</a> is usually described as a band, the project is in reality just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">founding member Blake Judd</a> and whatever additional members he has managed to recruit to provide additional instrumentation at any given line. The band's lineup from one album to the next is hardly ever the same. It has been rumored over the years that this is due to Judd being difficult to work with and perhaps a contemptible person in general (as many ex-members of Nachtmystium have indeed claimed; Charlie Fell even stated that the best thing that he ever did in his time with that band was smashing Judd's head through a tour bus window). In light of recent drug, theft, and fraud scandals surrounding Judd, this is not difficult to believe.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Exhumed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Exhumed">Exhumed</a> is up there with Napalm Death and Incantation as far as the sheer amount of former personnel goes; thanks to their hard-touring nature, members come and go often and with little warning, necessitating frequent live fill-ins. It's kind of telling when a band that just got back together a couple years ago has already had a near-total lineup change in just a little over a year.
</li><li> No one really knows what the glue is that keeps the name <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zao">Zao</a> going on, but albums keep getting made.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant">Warrant</a>, the band that made <em>Cherry Pie</em>, has had around 2 dozen musicians since 1984, and no lineup has lasted more than 2 years. Only guitarist Erik Turner and bassist Jerry Dixon have been around since the beginning.
</li><li> Lordy, Lordy, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi">Lordi</a></em>. The longest-lasting lineup lasted only 3 years.
</li><li> Friggan Otep. Otep herself is the only remaining member, and they have not had a consistent lineup that has lasted more than a year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDillingerEscapePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDillingerEscapePlan">The Dillinger Escape Plan</a> usually work as a five-piece and have had three rhythm guitarists, one vocalist<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7mzhm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7mzhm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7mzhm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton">Mike Patton</a> and Sean Ingram, who were never official members to begin with</span>, one bassist and two drummers leave over 13 years or so. Lead guitarist Ben Weiman is the only current member of the band from the original lineup, and even he very briefly quit once. In two separate cases, members have been forced to leave due to medical injuries rendering them unable to play their instruments: Original bassist Adam Doll was paralyzed from the chest down in a car accident, while guitarist Brian Benoit suffered nerve damage in his left hand. Benoit may or may not end up returning to the band - he's able to play guitar again, but can no longer play it at the technically-demanding level required by most of the band's material.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax">Anthrax</a> has been like this. Since releasing their first album, the only two members who've been in the band the whole time are guitarist Scott Ian and drummer Charlie Benante. They've had four singers, two bassists (one left, and came back, with the other filling in on live performances while the first was gone), and two lead guitarists, plus several guitarists who recorded in the studio but were never official members of the band.
</li><li> Rose Funeral have been a band since 2005. In that time, 18 members have joined and left. Very few have anything good to say about the personalities of the core members.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Periphery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Periphery">Periphery</a> have also been together since 2005. Thanks to a recent shedding of members, the only remaining founding member is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Misha Mansoor</a>, and they have particular difficulty retaining singers - they don't even average a new one every two years, having had four in their seven-year life.
</li><li> Incantation is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">John McEntee</a> and anyone who shows up; thanks to their incredibly prolific live appearances, they have had a truly staggering amount of former members in the form of live fill-ins and studio session enlistees, ranging from established figures to one-shots who never did anything else. The amount is so large that no one has ever bothered to list them all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aborted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aborted">Aborted</a> is essentially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Sven de Caluwé</a> Band, having 19 former members (24 if you count session members and live fill-ins) and Sven as the only consistent figure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Annihilator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Annihilator">Annihilator</a>. Since their beginning, they have had a whopping <em>24</em> former members, and that's excluding the ones who left and came back. Guitarist Jeff Waters is the only constant member, though they've had Dave Padden as their singer for almost 9 years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR">GWAR</a> have had 3 vocalists, 15 guitarists (two at a time), 5 bassists (a couple of whom have been in-and-outs), 5 drummers, 2 keyboardists, plus many miscellaneous performers (though, surprisingly, there hasn't been nearly as much turnover among the Slaves) over the last 29 years. Following the 2014 death of frontman Dave Brockie, the group has soldiered on with no remaining original members, although rhythm guitarist Mike "Balzac the Jaws of Death" Derks has been with the band since 1988.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WoodsOfYpres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WoodsOfYpres">Woods Of Ypres</a> tore through 23 different members in their 9-year run, with only late frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">David Gold</a> surviving through each lineup and album. Of their members, only two (David Gold and ex-keyboardist Jessica Rose) even appeared on <em>two</em> of their 5 studio albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Turisas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Turisas">Turisas</a>. Only two original members remain (vocalist Mathias 'Warlord' Nygard and guitarist Jussi Wickstrom), and since the band's inception in 1997, they've had eighteen members (that's including Nygard and Wickstrom). In the time period between their last album and their current one, they've managed to go through three bassists. That's a space of about two or two and a half years. Bassists seem to be the main source of the problem - since 1999, they've had no less than six (that's including the current one), three of whom only lasted one year each.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a>. Only person who has been on all the albums is guitarist and clean vocalist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Michael</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Keene.</a> From their origin in 2004, they are on their third bassist, second rhythm guitarist, second harsh vocalist, and sixth drummer, and they're now looking for their third rhythm guitarist due to Wes Hauch's departure. As of 2014, this reached its logical extreme when <em>everyone</em> save for Keene left within the span of a couple months.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StaticX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StaticX">Static X</a>'s only consistent members were lead vocalist/guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Wayne Static</a> and bassist Tony Campos. Pretty much everyone else kept changing throughout the band's career until their breakup in 2010, with Static continuing his solo career, and Campos joining Soulfly. Static died in 2014, shortly after he reformed the band without Campos. In 2018, Campos and the other two surviving original members reformed the band with a new singer.
</li><li> We Came As Romans had this bad during their early years (circa 2005). The only founding members left are lead guitarist Joshua Moore and now-vocalist then-guitarist David Stephens (who stepped away from WCAR for a year). They had three singers, two bassists, and two drummers leave in the course of a <em>two-year span.</em> The band's lineup was consistent from 2008 to 2017, when drummer Eric Choi left.
</li><li> Suffokate has, in their eleven-year runtime, had nineteen former members, with drummer Lars Diaz being the only remaining founder. Like the Rose Funeral example, few of those former members have anything nice to say about him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Testament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Testament">Testament</a> became one of these after <em>The Ritual</em> (where after that album was completed, two of the band's lineup for five albums left, and another one left after the following album), with constant switch-ups in guitarists and drummers in the nineties (at one point they had somehow gotten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Dave Lombardo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death">Steve DiGiorgio</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Obituary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Obituary">James Murphy</a> all on one album) and even to this day have trouble keeping a drummer. Rhythm guitarist Eric Peterson is the only founding member left, and he and vocalist Chuck Billy (actually the third singer) are the only two to appear on all the albums.
</li><li> Few bands were as unstable as the aptly-named death metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Death">Death</a>. Founder Chuck Schuldiner being the only constant member, the band couldn't keep the same lineup for more than one album. In fact, of every Death member besides Chuck, only bassist Terry Butler, drummer Bill Andrews, and bassist Steve <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiGiorgio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiGiorgio">Di Giorgio</a> would feature on two different records. Including members who came and left prior to the recording of the band's debut album, Death had a grand total of 23 members. It became less of a band and more like Schuldiner's solo project.
</li><li> L.A.Guns is a case more extreme than most. The band had an extremely unstable lineup from the beginning, and the "classic" lineup (Tracii Guns, Phil Lewis, Kelly Nickels Mick Cripps, and Steve Riley), which lasted during their period of greatest success from 1987-1992, was the <em>eighth</em> incarnation. For several years, there were TWO, COMPETING versions of the L.A. Guns, one fronted by Phil Lewis and the other fronted by Tracii Guns. There's been about three dozen members of one or the other incarnations of L.A. Guns since 1983.
</li><li> The Acacia Strain's Vincent Bennett is the only original member left. Since its inception in 2001, they've gone through 3 guitarists, one drummer, and no fewer than 4 bass players, 3 of which in 3 years' time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOcean">The Ocean</a> was this for the first nine years of existence. Over 20 musicians appeared on certain albums, and in the beginning, the band lineups were never consistent from one album to the next. Since 2009 they've had a far more stable line up of five members.
</li><li> Oceano was down to one original member, vocalist Adam Warren, just 2 years after being formed in 2007, although there had been other vocalists before him. As of 2016, they're on their 3rd drummer, 5th lead guitarist, 3rd rhythm guitarist, and 3rd bassist.
</li><li> Doom metal pioneers Pentagram had a fairly stable lineup from 1971 to 1975, but as singer Bobby Liebling's drug and ego problems became difficult for his bandmates to bear, Pentagram would become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">Revolving Door Band</a> from 1976 onward, with Liebling being the only constant member. A total of 37 musicians have been part of Pentagram since 1971, and only two of them aside from Liebling (current member Victor Griffin - guitars, 12 years in four stints, and ex-member Joe Hasselvander - multiple instruments, 13 years in three stints) have spent a combined decade or more with the band.
<ul><li> Thanks to manager, friend, and <em>Last Days Here</em> documentary maker Sean "Pellet" Pelletier, Liebling kicked drugs in the early 2010s, and that may have helped reduce turnover within the band.
</li></ul></li><li> Mild example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dismember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dismember">Dismember</a>. While the vocals and drum slots remain almost constant throughout the years, the band went through a number of bassists and guitarists.
</li><li> Emmure has become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Frankie Palmeri</a> band over the years, culminating in the entire band and its last two original members besides Palmeri up and leaving in late 2015 and being replaced only days later.

Only has two of its original members remain as of 2018's <em>Sign of the Dragonhead</em>. It was formed out of the romance between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheatreOfTragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheatreOfTragedy">Theatre of Tragedy</a> singer <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LivKristine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LivKristine">Liv Kristine</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Atrocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Atrocity">Atrocity</a> growler Alexander Krull, but they divorced in 2016 and she left the band to be replaced by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AngelNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AngelNation">Elina Siirala</a>. The other remaining founder is Thorsten Bauer.
</li><li> Swedish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMetal">Power Metal</a> kings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton">Sabaton</a> kept the same lineup from 2005 to 2012 (they'd previously switched drummers and added a dedicated keyboardist in 2005), but after the release of <em>Carolus Rex</em>, everybody except lead singer Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström left due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>. They've since changed drummers and one guitarist again.
</li><li> The ex-members of Sabaton in turn formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CivilWar">Civil War</a> with Nils Patrik Johannson as lead vocalist. They added a third guitarist in 2014, but then one of the ex-Sabaton guitarists and the bassist quit in 2014, and they fired Johannson due to personal problems in 2016 and replaced him with Kelly Sundown Carpenter.
</li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce">DragonForce</a> formed in 1999, theyve had 4 bassists, 4 drummers, 2 keyboardists, and 2 vocalists, they can hardly go one album without suffering a lineup change. The only members still left from their founding are guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman.
</li><li> As of 2019, Abigail Williams has gone through <em>26</em> former members and has had about as many live members. Outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Ken Sorceron</a> (who wound up being the only non-session member on 2019's <em>Walk Beyond the Dark</em>), Ian Jekelis and Jeff Wilson were the only members who stuck around for more than two uninterrupted years. Because of their unstable lineups, it is also almost guaranteed that at least one member on a tour will be a fill-in.
</li><li> Woe, Is Me was only active for about four years, and their constant lineup shifts might have played a hand in them being around for so long. They blew through no less than eight different musicians (most notably Tyler Carter and Michael Bohn who started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Issues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Issues">Issues</a>) in two years and their final lineup only lasted for one album before calling it quits(and even then Austin Thorton was kicked out shortly after <em>Genesis</em> dropped). The only consistent member was guitarist Kevin Hanson.
</li><li> For the Fallen Dreams might be the kings of this trope as far as metalcore is concerned. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Fallen_Dreams#Members">Just look at this chart!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Surprisingly enough, albums and tours still happen with guitarist Jim Hocking being the glue that holds the band together.

</li><li> UK newspapers actually more or less invoked this trope when the last original Sugababe had a breakdown and "quit", which meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sugababes">Sugababes</a> replaced all three of its original members over the last 12 years or so. To add to the Sugababes mess, as soon as the last original member (Keisha) left, there was immediately talk of the original three reforming as a new band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MutyaKeishaSiobhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MutyaKeishaSiobhan">which ultimately became a reality</a> three years later.

</li><li> Spanish vocal group Fórmula Abierta was formed in 2002, after the first season of talent show <em>Operación Triunfo</em>, by contestants Álex, Javián, Geno and Mireia. Álex left before the end of the year and Miguel Ángel Silva from the second season of <em>Operación Triunfo</em> would take his place in 2003 until the group disbanded in 2004. In 2017, the group reunited with its original four members, but Mireia had to pull out just a few days later, and in January 2020, Geno left the band and was replaced with Tessa, who, like Miguel Ángel Silva, was an <em>OT2</em> alum. Javián is the only member to have been in the band through the entirety of its two runs at this point.

</li><li> The lineup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackFlag">Black Flag</a> flip-flopped so much that they'd occasionally have random audience members join the band because someone quit on extremely short notice.
</li><li> Horror-punk group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits">The Misfits</a> have had some 17 different members in only about 20 active years.

</li><li> Psychobilly / horror punk godfathers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCramps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCramps">The Cramps</a> had twenty-one bassists, rhythm and lead guitarists and drummers between their formation in 1976 and their dissolution in 2009, besides founder members/constants vocalist Lux Interior and his wife, guitarist Poison Ivy.
</li><li> Northern Irish Punk band Stiff Little Fingers have gone through four drummers, three bassists (including losing their original bassist just before they got a record deal and replacement Ali McMordie leaving in the early '90s and coming back in the late 2000s) and two guitarists in their time together. Only lead singer, guitarist, and lyricist Jake Burns has been a constant member.
</li><li> Seattle punk band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fastbacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fastbacks">Fastbacks</a> were famous for their inability to keep a regular drummer, the official count is somewhere between 15 and 20. Among the band's drummers were Duff McKagan (later of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a>), John Moen (later of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists">The Decemberists</a>), Dan Peters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a> and Jason Finn of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePresidentsOfTheUnitedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePresidentsOfTheUnitedStatesOfAmerica">The Presidents of the United States of America</a>. The band eventually settled on a permanent drummer, Mike Musberger, who stuck with them for a decade until the band's 2002 split.
</li><li> The UK Subs, which formed in 1976 have gone through 21 different guitarists, 34 different drummers, and 19 different bass guitarists. Lead singer Charlie Harper has been the only constant member, with co-founder and Guitarist Nicky Garrett routinely playing for several years, taking a break for a few years, and then returning.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AgainstMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AgainstMe">Against Me!</a> initially started as an acoustic solo act by Laura Jane Grace, who then recruited Kevin Mahon to play drums. This duo recorded a few demo cassettes together. Then Kevin was fired, and bassist Dustin Fridkin came into the fold. Grace and Fridkin then recorded together before guitarist James Bowman and drummer Warren Oakes were hired. The lineup of Grace, Bowman, Fridkin, and Oakes recorded the band's first full-length album, <em>Reinventing Axl Rose</em>. Fridkin then left and was replaced by Andrew Seward. The Grace-Bowman-Seward-Oakes era remained constant until Oakes left (or was fired, depending on whom one talks to) after their major-label debut <em>New Wave</em>. George Rebelo of fellow punk band Hot Water Music recorded their next album <em>White Crosses</em> as drummer before leaving to return to Hot Water Music. He was then replaced by Jay Weinberg, son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Max</a>. The lineup of Grace-Bowman-Seward-Weinberg managed to record a single, "Russian Spies / Occult Enemies" together. This lineup also attempted to record the band's next full-length album <em>Transgender Dysphoria Blues</em> together, but this didn't materialize. Weinberg quit via Twitter, and Seward left amicably. The album was recorded with Atom Willard on drums, with Grace handling bass herself on the album save for two songs, which were recorded by Fat Mike of NOFX. After a few years of Inge Johansson of The (International) Noise Conspiracy handling bass duties, Seward returned in 2018. The current lineup is now Grace, Bowman, Seward, and Willard, or about 3/4 of the band's classic lineup.

Garrett Zabrocki left shortly after Heath, and the band has subsequently lost its sole other founding member, drummer Dan Trapp, to be replaced by Chris Hornbrook. This was quite an unpopular decision because of Trapp's skill on drums. The rest of the band aside from Nielsen, current guitarist and fill-in bassist Gavin Casswell, and Chris Hornbrook, are all touring members.

<ul><li> In recent years, however, the line-up has mostly stabilized as Latimer, long-time bassist Colin Bass (from 1979-1981, and since 1984), and drummer Dennis Clement(since 2000), with the keyboardist spot changing every tour.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollectiveSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollectiveSoul">Collective Soul</a> now qualifies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Ed Roland</a> (lead vocals, songwriting, rhythm guitar, piano), Ross Childress (lead guitar) and Shane Evans (drums) founded the band in 1992, with Ed's younger brother Dean Roland (guitar) and Will Turpin (bass, backing vocals) joining soon after. Since 2001, they've had two new lead guitarists (Joel Kosche and Jesse Triplett) and three drummers (Ryan Hoyle, Cheney Brannon, and Johnny Rabb).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">King</a> of this trope. Since they were founded in 1969, they've had 19 members (not including recording/touring guest musicians, with which the number would climb to about 30) pass through, around, and back to the band. It's so complicated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_crimson#Personnel_.2F_album_chart">resorted to using a table<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The only constant is guitarist Robert Fripp, who has been with the band from the very start (and he didn't start making major songwriting contributions until the band's fourth album). Now he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">become the band</a>, but only partly by default, as by his words "King Crimson is a way of doing things" (of course by this point his influence on the band's writing is indisputable).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a>, which had eight different line-ups, with drummer Ian Paice as the only constant member - and true to the "revolving" part, three times the band returned to the Mark II formation that recorded <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHead">Machine Head</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kansas">Kansas</a> has had a large number of musicians who have joined, left, rejoined, and re-left the band. Each tour might have a different set of musicians depending upon who is up for touring at any given time. Most of the departures seem amicable, as those members occasionally help out later tours and/or records. The only stable members are Drummer Phil Ehart (who had a short-term replacement on one tour so he could focus on being the manager) and Guitarist Rich Williams. Lead Vocalist and Keyboardist Steve Walsh has been there nearly the same length of time, only being gone from about 1981 to 1986. His short-term replacement, John Elefante, has never returned, though he was invited to rejoin in 2014 after Steve Walsh's retirement (he respectfully declined). Guitarist/Keyboardist/Songwriter/founder Kerry Livgren frequently reappears at regular intervals. Original Bassist Dave Hope occasionally reappears, but current Bassist Billy Greer has been around since 1986, although at one point they were both bassists at the same time! Touring Keyboardist Greg Robert was officially a member in the early '90s, but permanently retired after 10 years and has not rejoined. Violinists Robby Steinhardt and David Ragsdale have also alternated through the years, each bringing different benefits -Steinhardt contributes original vocals, which don't seem to have deteriorated over the years, unlike Steve Walsh. However, when not singing or playing the violin, he pretty much stands around uselessly on stage, as opposed to David Ragsdale, whose ability to play guitar allows him to contribute to every song all of the time. And as of August 2014, long time singer Steve Walsh has retired after forty-one years to be replaced by Ronnie Platt. Following that, they added longtime contributors David Manion and Zak Rizvi on keyboards and guitars, respectively.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> has only had two mainstays; Paul Stanley (lead vocals, guitar) and Gene Simmons (lead vocals, bass). Founding members Peter Criss (drums) and Ace Frehley (lead guitar) both left (or were kicked out) in the early '80s, to be replaced by Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent, respectively. Vincent was fired as well, replaced briefly by Mark St. John and for longer by Bruce Kulick. In 1991, Carr died and Eric Singer replaced him at the drums, but both he and Kulick were fired when the original line-up was reunited. After that, it became a confusing mix of either Frehley or Criss leaving, with Tommy Thayer replacing Frehley whenever he was gone, and Eric Singer returning to the drum set whenever Criss left. Stanley, Simmons, Thayer, and Singer have been the fairly stable line-up since 2004, but just in case, both Thayer and Singer just use Frehley's and Criss's old make-up just to make it less confusing.
</li><li> Canadian rock band Econoline Crush's only consistent member is frontman Trevor Hurst. All other members throughout the band's history (and there have been many, between the band's 4 albums, 2 E.P.s, and heavy touring history) have popped in and out of the lineup depending on availability and interest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> has had a rotating cast of musicians in all positions, except bass (which had been Chris Squire until he died in 2015). Drummer Alan White has also been a constant since joining in 1972. When Squire died in 2015, former guitarist Billy Sherwood took his place. Currently, no original members remain in Yes, with Steve Howe and Alan White being the only remaining members from their classic lineups.
<ul><li> It got so ridiculous, Wikipedia actually has to devote <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Yes_band_members">a whole page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> full of lists, charts, and graphs for the sole purpose of tracking the ever-shifting lineup.
</li><li> One unique period between 1991-1992 occurred when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>-based, pop-friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980s</a> official lineup of Yes joined up with the members of splinter group Anderson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">Bruford</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickWakeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickWakeman">Wakeman</a> Howe (a more progressive rock-based lineup composed of departing Yes vocalist Jon Anderson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">1970s</a> Yes alumni) to form an eight-man supergroup. The result was a rush-released, botched and heavily doctored 1991 album <em>Union</em>, comprising recordings from each lineup stitched together. An eight-man "in the round" world tour (described by Bill Bruford as "the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em> meets the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty">Dynasty</a></em>") was better received but never repeated.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Asia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Asia">Asia</a> has even had musicians join and leave without ever recording.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Marillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Marillion">Marillion</a> up until 1984. They also had three different vocalists in 1989, but their line-up has remained stable ever since.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd">Puddle of Mudd</a> hasn't had a lineup last longer than five years. Wes Scantlin is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">the only original member left.</a>
</li><li> Popular culture would have you believe this was the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead">Grateful Dead</a>'s keyboardists, but they're actually a Downplayed example, with most of the changes taking place years apart: Founding keyboardist Ron "Pigpen" McKernan played with the band for seven years before he was gradually replaced by Keith Godchaux (the two were even in the band at the same time for a nearly a year). Godchaux also lasted seven years before he too was replaced, by Brent Mydland in 1979. Myland stayed on until his death 11 years later in 1990 (making that lineup of the Dead a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineup">Long Runner Lineup</a>), and was replaced by Vince Welnick, who remained with the band until they broke up five years later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> had bandleader Ian Anderson from the beginning, and guitarist Martin Barre since 1969. Much of the band's history has revolved around Anderson, Barre, and various keyboardists, bassists, and drummers (and recently occasional female violinists for live work). When Anderson reformed the band in 2017, Barre wasn't part of the lineup.
</li><li> In its nearly 40-year history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a> has chewed up and spit out six lead vocalists, six drummers, three keyboardists, and three bassists, with several of those revolving door personnel lasting less than a year. The only person who has been ever-present since the band's founding in 1973 is lead guitarist Neal Schon, although keyboardist Jonathan Cain has also been a constant since 1980.
</li><li> The Little River Band has replaced <em>all</em> of its members <em>multiple</em> times. In fact, the original lineup got in legal trouble in the mid-2000s when they wanted to tour under the name "Little River Band" and the current lineup wouldn't let them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>. The only constant members were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Phil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Lynott</a> (vocals, bass and songwriting) and Brian Downey (drums). After Phil Lynott died in 1986, who will be touring under the name next time it appears is anyone's guess, but if you're lucky it'll at least have one of the members that were in the band whilst Phil was alive (since 1991 that's usually Scott Gorham). Ex-members include Gary Moore, Snowy White and Midge Ure. Their door revolved so much the issue has <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Lizzy_band_members">its own page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>.

However, the <em>members</em> have always been Chris Murphy, Patrick Pentland, Jay Ferguson, and Andrew Scott.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Melvins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Melvins">Melvins</a> have had a serious problem with keeping a bassist. While the two founding members have been around since the band's inception they have gone through six official bassists and multiple stand-ins/auditions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Kurt Cobain</a> even auditioned but was rejected because he got so nervous he forgot all of their songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a>. They've had at least 8 bassists, 8 keyboardists and at the last count 13 drummers, and they've gone from 7 members to 3 back up to 5 again, but always revolving around co-founder Dave Brock.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8og77');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8og77" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8og77');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Stats taken from the list of former and current members on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> page, which lists 45 members.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a> were notorious for frequent changes during their lifetime; founder and only constant member Ritchie Blackmore never retained the same line-up for two successive studio albums. On one occasion he hired and then fired a bassist before he even got the chance to record on the album they were working on!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject">The Alan Parsons Project</a>, centering around songwriters Parsons (also producer/engineer) and Eric Woolfson while the musicians rotated regularly. Woolfson sang and played piano from time to time; Parsons almost never sang (he talked through a digital vocoder on their first album).
</li><li> Seminal death-rock group Christian Death has had 49 different members in the past 30 years; they're not a big band, mind you, they only ever have 4-5 people in the band at a time. They just rotate in and out like mad. They sort of have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Face of the Band</a>, but it's changed hands several times: Rozz Williams, Valor Kand, Rozz Williams again, Valor Kand again. No member has been with the band for its entire run.
</li><li> Industrial rock group, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pigface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pigface">Pigface</a>, has had a total of 72 different members since its founding.
</li><li> The only member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge">Queens of the Stone Age</a> that has appeared on all their albums is its founder, Josh Homme.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a> were infamous for their constant personnel changes during the mid-80s. Infamously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">David Coverdale</a> fired all his band members who played on their best-selling album <em>Whitesnake</em> after the album's sessions finished, even though they had only played on that album. The current post-2003 lineup enjoyed relative stability for a while but in 2010 not one, not two, but THREE members left. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Whitesnake_Band_Members">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a page dedicated to the various Whitesnake line-ups over the years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> was founded in 1973. Five years later, they were on their second vocalist, seventh bassist, and <em>eighth</em> drummer. Two years later, they had to replace the vocalist again after the incumbent one <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">died</a></strong>. However, the lineup has stabilized since, with only a few personnel changes. And one drummer case takes the "Revolving" part to the extreme: Chris Slade was replaced in 1994 by the returning Phil Rudd (said eighth drummer, who recorded the band's best-known albums such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackInBlack">Back in Black</a></em>), and replaced Rudd in 2015 once he was arrested and consequently expelled from the band. Between 2014 and 2016, four of the band's five longstanding members all left, with just founding guitarist Angus Young remaining from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineUp">Long-Runner Line-up</a> that had existed just a few years prior.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Wings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s second band, lasted for about eight years. During this time, they had five or six line-ups, three lead guitarists, four drummers (five if you count Paul when there were only three members), and two periods when only the core trio (Paul, his wife Linda and guitarist Denny Laine) was present.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> took its name partially from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">lead guitarist</a> Tracii Guns, who was replaced in its first few months and restarted L.A. Guns (the band that had merged to form Guns n' Roses). The revolving door of guitarists, bassists, and drummers accelerated after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Axl took complete control</a>. However, both of the band's keyboardists have remained ever since joining.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackCrowes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackCrowes">The Black Crowes</a> are the brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, and whoever else they can get to play with them at the time. Drummer Steve Gorman comes the closest to being the third constant, having joined the band in their second year, and only missing a couple months after they reformed (after their first breakup).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> had a pretty stable lineup (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> on vocals, Tony Iommi on guitar, Geezer Butler on bass, and Bill Ward on drums) until Ozzy left the band in 1979. Since then, they have gone through <em>nine</em> vocalists (Dave Walker in 1977, Ronnie James Dio from 1979-1982, Ian Gillan in 1983, Ron Keel and David Donato in 1984, Jeff Fenholt in 1985, Glenn Hughes from 1985-1986, Ray Gillen in 1986, Tony Martin from 1987-1991, Dio again from 1991-1992, Rob Halford for a brief period in 1992, Tony Martin again from 1993-1997, Ozzy again from 1997-2006, Dio for a third time from 2006 until his death in 2010, and Osbourne again since) <em>seven</em> bassists (Craig Gruber in 1979, Butler again through 1985, Dave Spitz from 1985-1986, Bob Daisley in 1986, then Spitz again, Jo Burt in 1987, Lawrence Cottle from 1988-1989, Neil Murray from 1989-1991, Geezer again from 1991-1994, Murray again from 1994-1997, and Butler since 1997) and <em>nine</em> drummers (Vinny Appice from 1980-1982, Bill Ward again from 1982-1983, Bev Bevan from 1983-1984, Ward for a third time from 1984-1985, Eric Singer from 1985-1987, Bevan again in 1987, with Terry Chimes the same year, Cozy Powell from 1988-1991, Vinny Appice again from 1991-1993, Bobby Rondinelli from 1993-1997, Appice yet again in 1998, Ward for a fourth time from 1998-2006, Appice for a fourth time from 2006-2010, Ward for a <em>fifth</em> time from 2011-2012, and Tommy Clufetos since).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> are down to just one original member, lead guitarist Gary Rossington, due to the deaths, retirements and/or departures of various original and classic lineup members in the 1990's and 2000's. Not only that, but Rossington is the <em>only</em> member of the current lineup that played with the band before their 1977 disbanding.

</li><li> The same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheYardbirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheYardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>. In both the original band and the current reformation, drummer Jim McCarty has been the only consistent member.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, at least as a touring band. Trent Reznor employed 19 different musicians across eight major touring cycles, often as a four-piece band. (In the studio, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Reznor goes it entirely alone</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a> went through a flurry of lineup changes in the early to mid-'80s, then replaced the lead singer with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikePatton">skinny kid from another band</a> and stayed constant for a few years. Cue a quick series of guitarists before the breakup. Since the reformation in 2009, they've kept the same lineup from their last studio album in 1997.
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoobieBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DoobieBrothers">Doobie Brothers</a> are so notorious for this, they inspired this pun; "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">She's had more members in her than the Doobie Brothers!</a>"
</li><li> There are two categories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon">Sound Horizon</a> band members: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Revo</a> and people who aren't Revo.
</li><li> Prog/Pomp rock band The Enid have had numerous changes of lineup since their formation in 1975, with only keyboardist/composer Robert John Godfrey being common to all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra">Petra</a>, founded in 1972, was like this throughout its career, in particular during the '80s. Rarely did two consecutive albums have the same lineup. The longest-running member is founder and lead guitarist Bob Hartman who retired from touring in 1994 but still wrote music and played in the studio until he returned to touring in 2001 with the release of <em>Revival</em>. He remains active with the band to this day. The second longest-running member is lead singer John Schlitt who has actively toured with the band since 1986.
</li><li> The only member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s to remain in the band for its entire history was drummer Mick Fleetwood. The band was named after him and bassist John McVie, the latter of whom initially declined membership and Bob Brunning became the band's original bass player...for a few weeks before McVie changed his mind. Things got <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fleetwood_Mac_members">even more complicated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> over the next few decades with members coming and going and coming back only to leave again.
</li><li> John Mayall's Bluesbreakers have featured 32 musicians from 1963-1970 and 1982-2008, and have been a farm system of sorts for some of England's most influential rock and blues musicians. Bluebreakers alumni include but are not limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a>, three-fifths of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a> (the aforementioned Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, and Peter Green), and ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> guitarist Mick Taylor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a> from 1966 to 1969. Roger McGuinn was all that remained of the founding line-up throughout its tenure.
</li><li> The Strawbs: 32 musicians so far, in 25 lineups. Not even frontman Dave Cousins was immune, having taken a break at the start of the '80s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a> went through flurries of musicians from about the time Terry Kath died to about 1990. They've since stabilized, but have had a total of 16 different "permanent" members, along with several guests and subs. Still, the band has had 4 members remain for its entire history: Robert Lamm, and James Pankow, Walter Parazaider, and Lee Loughane, the latter 3 all members of the horn section.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronButterfly">Iron Butterfly</a> went through 59 lineups (Arguably 60, but the Doug Ingle/Ron Bushy/Erik Braunn/Lee Dorman happened twice) in 46 years—including hiatuses. None of these members, not even relative constants Ingle and Bushy, have been in the band consistently since its formation.
</li><li> Fuel has an interesting version of this. The original singer, Brett Scallions, left in 2005 and was replaced by Toryn Green. Around 2008 or so, the band became inactive. In 2010, Brett started touring with his band under the Fuel name, however none of the other original members were in this version of the band. This means that not a single member of the band has appeared on both of their last 2 albums.
<ul><li> The 2010 formation probably counts on its own, having gone through 3 guitarists and 4 drummers.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> group Whiteheart had a large number of band changes during its 15-year existence; including Steve Green (better known as an inspirational singer) on the debut album. After Green left, a vocalist named Scott Douglas joined for a pair of albums only to be kicked out following an arrest in 1985 for aggravated sexual battery before Rick Florian took over main vocals for the remainder of the band's existence. By the time the last album was released in 1997; only 2 original members (Billy Smiley and Mark Gersmehl) remained in the band.
</li><li> While most bands tend to become more like revolving doors over time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> did the reverse. The original Quarrymen was a frequently-shifting lineup of teenagers: formed in 1956, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> didn't join until 1957 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> until 1958, and it wasn't until 1959 that the group was reduced to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>, McCartney and Harrison. The band's revolving door tendency stops there, with just two major changes after that: In 1960-61 they took on, then lost, Stu Sutcliffe and went through a number of drummers before settling on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">Pete Best</a>. Best was fired in favour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> in 1962, a few months after they got their original big recording contract, and the lineup was <em>almost</em> completely stable from then until the band dissolved once and for all in 1970. (Apart from the Quarrymen reunion that didn't include any of the Fab Four...)
</li><li> Southern rockers Blackfoot changed membership throughout its career, with something like 40 musicians passing through its ranks. The group retained only lead singer Rickey Medlocke throughout all of the changes until 1997 when he retired to re-join his old band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>. The most notable change came in 2012, when the entire lineup, including original member Greg T. Walker, were replaced by younger hired hands and began recording new material, produced by Medlocke. Many fans of the band have accused this new lineup of being nothing short of a glorified cover band.
</li><li> Fellow Southern rock band Molly Hatchet had a similarly fluid lineup. Their only semi-regular members were founding guitarist Dave Hlubek and singer Danny Joe Brown, the latter of whom wasn't an original member but had joined before their first album. When Hlubek quit in 1987, he was the last remaining original member. Brown would also quit in 1995, and since then Molly Hatchet has been led by two members that joined in the late '80s after their hitmaking days were over. Hlubek would return from 2005 until his death in 2017.
</li><li> Mike + The Mechanics were a supergroup formed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford in 1985 as a vehicle for his solo compositions, after Rutherford had produced one solo album, <em>Smallcreep's Day</em>, in 1980 with a different singer throughout, followed by 1982's <em>Acting Very Strange</em>, which had Rutherford himself singing. They comprised of Rutherford, keyboardist Adrian Lee, vocalist Paul Young (not the "Everytime You Go Away" one) of Sad Café, keyboardist/vocalist Paul Carrack (ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze">Squeeze</a>) and drummer Peter Van Hooke of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManfredMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManfredMann">Manfred Mann</a>. By 2004's <em>Rewired</em>, particularly after Young's death, the band had been reduced to Rutherford and Carrack; the album was credited to "Mike + The Mechanics featuring Paul Carrack". Rutherford formed a completely new line up for the album's follow-up, "The Road".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gong">Gong</a> has had dozens of members throughout the years, and there have been several instances where the band has featured no original or classic members. Bandleader and founder Daevid Allen left Gong in 1975 and the band was subsequently renamed Pierre Moerlen's Gong to identify both its new leader (drummer Pierre Moerlen, a member since 1973) and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">change in sound</a> from space rock to jazz fusion. Allen and co-founder Gilli Smyth reconvened Gong in 1992 with a mix of current and former members, with the two of them as the only constant members. Smith left the band in 2013 and died three years later. Allen was still leading Gong when he died in 2016, but he had encouraged the current version of band - all of which had joined in the preceding 10 years - to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace">continue on without him</a>. Right now, the official version of Gong contains no original or classic-era personnel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> and the All-Starr Band has a revolving door membership by design. The concept for the group is that everyone on stage with Ringo is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">star in their own right</a>," who each get their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepUpToTheMicrophone">own spotlight moments</a> during concerts to perform songs from their career. There are usually a couple membership changes with each tour, although certain musicians like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MenAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MenAtWork">Colin Hay</a> have had multiple tenures with the band.
</li><li> The Grass Roots began in 1965 as a studio project instigated by producers/songwriters Steve Barri and P.F. Sloan, playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a>. After some initial success, Barri and Sloan hired an actual band called The Bedouins to become The Grass Roots. But with the producers controlling most of the band's material and even hiring session musicians to play on the recordings, the band clashed with them and were essentially fired. Another band was hired to assume the role of The Grass Roots in 1967—The 13th Floor, with bassist/lead singer Rob Grill, lead guitarist Creed Bratton, rhythm guitarist Warren Entner and drummer Rick Coonce. Right off the bat they scored a huge hit with "Let's Live for Today", with Bratton playing the song's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff">Epic Riff</a>. The next year they had another major hit with "Midnight Confessions", but Bratton became the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a> figure, demanding more control over their music, which the record label wasn't willing to give them. After a disastrous appearance at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in 1969,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9fa3i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9fa3i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9fa3i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bratton took some LSD that a fan had given him before the show, and was too tripped out to play properly</span> Bratton was asked to leave the band. After that they went through literally dozens of members as they had a few more hits. By 1974, Grill was the only 13th Floor member remaining, and he went solo three years later, though he rejoined in 1980 to lead them onto the oldies circuit. Ironically, despite his short tenure, Bratton is now the band's most famous member because of his role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUs">The Office</a></em>.

Clinton's TV Tropes page lists the musicians involved. It is a very long list. Suffice it to say that <em>sixteen</em> musicians were inducted when P-Funk got in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And that doesn't cover everyone who's played in Parliament-Funkadelic or its present incarnation, the P-Funk All-Stars.

</li><li> Few groups can top the achievement of The Drifters. They first formed as the backing group for Clyde McPhatter after he left Billy Ward &amp; The Dominoes. Then after a year McPhatter was drafted into the military and elected to go solo after his discharge. Jazz trumpeter George Treadwell took over as manager and oversaw various personnel shifts over the next few years. In 1958 he fired the entire lineup and hired another vocal group, The Five Crowns, to become The Drifters. After a few years, lead singer Ben E. King went solo, there were more changes, a couple previous members returned, and numerous competing Drifters groups flooded the oldies touring circuit. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sorts it all out. When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, seven of the most famous members were chosen, few of whom had actually ever performed together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes">The Supremes</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> iteration, with sole original member Mary Wilson becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Face of the Band</a> as a result.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotaryConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotaryConnection">Rotary Connection</a>: Each of their six albums had lineup changes, with only Minnie Riperton and Charles Stepney involved in all of them. This was one reason the final album was billed as performed by The New Rotary Connection, although it is still considered part of the RC canon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTemptations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTemptations">The Temptations</a>: Only Otis Williams — ironically, the member with the fewest lead vocal parts — survives from either one of the group's classic lineups (the ones fronted by David Ruffin, and later by Dennis Edwards). The group has undergone dozens of lineup changes since forming in the 1960s, even in their hitless early days, but especially after "classic" members like Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, and Paul Williams left for one reason or another. Bass singer Melvin Franklin was, like Williams, a mainstay of the Tempts since their formation, until his death in 1995.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaYoopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaYoopers">Da Yoopers</a> were founded in <em>1975</em> and only percussionist Jim DeCaire and keyboardist Lynn Bellmore (née Anderson) are original. The bassist alone changed three times between 1986 and the mid-90s. What's more, almost all of their albums from the second onward have included large numbers of guest musicians. (At least two of these, "Cowboy" Dan Collins and Dick "Dick-E-Bird" Bunce, were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">former guests that were later assumed into the lineup</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GodspeedYouBlackEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GodspeedYouBlackEmperor">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> started out as a trio, then ballooned to about 15 members before settling down to 8 or 9 from then on.
</li><li> The Hit Crew, a cover band used for all the <em>Drew's Famous</em> CDs that are ubiquitous at party supply and drug stores. They cover every musical genre, and some of the CDs are quite good (and others are terrible). Every single one is attributed to "The Hit Crew" - from New Age to Disco to Metal to Country. The lineup is different from album to album and even song to song.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> started out as this, with various musicians joining as required, before settling into a fairly established lineup.
</li><li> Over its 28+ years of activity, Ronny Moorings has been Clan of Xymox's only constant member.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrontLineAssembly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrontLineAssembly">Front Line Assembly</a>: Bill Leeb has been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">centerpiece of the band</a> since the beginning, while Rhys Fulber has left and returned a few times, and other musicians have only stayed for a year or two.
</li><li> The only original members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteamPoweredGiraffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteamPoweredGiraffe">Steam Powered Giraffe</a> to still remain are two of the main robots, The Spine (David Michael Bennett) and Rabbit (Isabella "Bunny" Bennett). Other than that, the band has seen two robots leave and another join, replaced both of its original "Walter Girls", and gone through several drummers and a guitarist. Even Rabbit's design has changed to the point where she could be mistaken for a new robot at first glance!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans">Swans</a>' only true constant is frontman Michael Gira, with vocalist/keyboardist Jarboe and guitarist Norman Westberg both clocking in well over a decade each with the band and numerous others cycling in and out of the group over the years. In recent years, however, things seem to have settled down: The touring incarnation of the group upon reformation in 2010, which includes Westberg, is the longest-running in the band's history, having in 2017 following the live album <em>Deliquescence</em>. Gira had said in 2016 that Swans would feature a "revolving cast" going forward. Kristof Hahn is the only member of the previous lineup besides Gira on 2019's <em>leaving meaning</em>, but the rest appear as guests.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HiFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HiFive">Hi-5</a>. None of the line-up for the original Australian incarnation have been around since the beginning (in fact, the current "lineup" is comprised of non-permanent performers for touring purposes since the entire 2017 lineup left at the end of the following year). In fact, the lineup has changed so many times that Australian Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield once jokingly stated that he thinks the thing that should most worry parents is "the ever-changing ensemble that makes up Hi-5".
</li><li> There aren't any original members left of Rockapella (aka the house band from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhereInTheWorldIsCarmenSandiego">Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego</a></em>).
</li><li> Collegiate ensembles, or any ensemble based around a school as members graduate, student teach or simply get too busy to sing in the group. A more consistent membership was one of the reasons Minnesota conductor had for creating the <em>Dale Warland Singers</em>.
