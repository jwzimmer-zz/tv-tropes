A character (almost always a male) discovers that a seemingly innocent action now entitles him to a permanent fashion accessory — an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">intense young lady</a> who insists that they are now married. Sometimes it's a delusion on her part, but sometimes it's valid — at least by the rules of the place where she grew up.
</p><p>Naturally, this never happens to someone who would be willing to just walk away and leave her stranded. Or, for that matter, to someone who's willing to bite the bullet, settle down with their accidental bride, and have two and a half accidental children.
</p><p>When set in modern times, the possibility of the marriage being real is usually set up by the officiant being a legitimate minister or justice of the peace.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>As to the real-life possibility of an Accidental Marriage being valid (at least in North America), it's pretty remote: although courts in both the U.S. and Canada have decreed that a couple who thinks they're legally married is legally married, at the same time a marriage usually isn't considered valid without a marriage license, which has to be purchased <em>before</em> the wedding (and in most places both parties to the wedding have to buy the license together). This was originally meant to prevent marriage fraud, but it also allows the state or provincial government to make a little money on each ceremony.
</p><p>Additionally, the "getting drunk and waking up married" type is not valid either, since the law requires that both parties enter into the relationship voluntarily and in full possession of their faculties. (This is nearly always in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> in the US version, due to the fact that unlike many states Nevada does not require a waiting period between obtaining the license and the marriage itself, and that the Clark County marriage bureau office in Las Vegas is open until midnight every day of the year, even weekends and holidays.)

<ul><li> Lum's insistence that she is married to Ataru because he declared "Now I can get married!" (meaning to his girlfriend Shinobu) after winning the Tag Race in the first chapter/episode.
</li><li> For the first movie, Ataru discovers that an alien princess he played tag with as a child is interpreting the time he jumped on her shadow as a pledge to marry her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out the tradition she was naming was mostly ignored by everyone, and it also turns out that young Ataru had lied about jumping on her shadow</span>.
</li><li> Also in both the manga and TV Series, there was a story where a little earth girl with a crush on Jariten gave him some chocolate on Valentine's day, then telling him that by accepting it he'd promised to marry her. Everyone but Jariten found the whole thing cute and funny.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ImGonnaBeAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ImGonnaBeAnAngel">I'm Gonna Be an Angel!</a></em>, Yuusuke stumbles over Noel, who just happens to be napping in the nude in the middle of a forest. Their lips meet and she awakens, convinced that they are now married. This results in her entire kooky family moving into (and totally redesigning) Yuusuke's house.
</li><li> Neneko's belief that she "gave up her flower" and is now married to Tomokazu because he accidentally fondled her rear end in an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Yumeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Yumeria">Yumeria</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon">Photon</a></em>, after getting the kana for baka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDoodling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDoodling">drawn on his forehead</a> by his mischievous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">childhood friend</a> Aun, the title character draws the same characters on the forehead of the sleeping Keyne. Since in Keyne's culture, a man proposes to a woman by drawing his "personal symbol" on her forehead, Keyne awakens, discovers what happened, and concludes that she and Photon are engaged. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end, Photon ends up accidentally marrying Aun, Lashara and Keyne (again) when he draws the kana on all three of them, although he doesn't seem to understand what he's done</span>.
</li><li> As the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS">DearS</a></em>, the protagonist Takeya <em>bonds</em> with Ren through a direct kiss in the very first episode — then spent half of the series wondering what was going on between two of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Boa Hancock believes that she is married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Luffy</a> after he hugs her. However she is too shy to ever talk to him about this, and her grandmother later clears up her misunderstanding.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>: Utena Tenjou is surprised to find herself engaged to Anthy, the Rose Bride, after winning a duel against her previous fiance, Saionji.
</li><li> Subverted and parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>. Even though Itoshiki's hometown will marry anyone who makes eye contact, Itoshiki manages to spend the night there unmarried, even though in a desperate attempt to get him married, his family have sent various people who are good at making eye contact after Itoshiki... including footballers, thugs and a hideous 100-eyed monster.
<ul><li> There's a hilarious part of that episode where two of the people they hire <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get in a fight, make eye contact and end up engaged.</span>
</li><li> Similarly, both of the times he gets into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">embarrassing situations</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak">uber perfectionist</a> Chiri, she demands that he follows through by marrying her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, of course. Though it was actually accidental engagement, the relationship between Chi-Chi and Goku was largely based on his assumption that "married" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsItSomethingYouEat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsItSomethingYouEat">was a kind of food</a> and, in her joy to have a fiance, Chi Chi never really explained what it actually meant. When the misunderstanding is cleared years later and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">the now teenaged Chi Chi</a> gets depressed about it, though, Goku agrees to go through it anyway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyword">since he gave his word to her.</a> They eventually have two children together.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em>, the main character Nagasumi is rescued by Seto Sun, the daughter of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> mermaid family. Turns out she would have to be executed for breaking the mermaid code of secrecy by saving Nagasumi, unless he marries her.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YoureUnderArrest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YoureUnderArrest">You're Under Arrest!</a></em> when Yoriko accidentally gets engaged to a foreign prince named Saki Abdusha when she held his hand. He shrugs it off in the end saying his customs don't apply in Japan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He still proposes to Yoriko later, but she refuses his offer since he's much younger than she is and both have too many things to do.</span>
</li><li> This trope just piles up in the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Wolfram</a> spends all of dinner needling the new monarch Shibuya Yuuri, and succeeds in angering him by insulting his mother — whereupon Yuuri slaps him across the face. Unbeknownst to Yuuri, this constitutes a proposal of marriage. Instead of clearing up the confusion, Wolfram's brothers urge Yuuri to 'take it back', but Yuuri, thinking they mean the insult of the slap, swears he never will. The insulted and embarrassed Wolfram then throws his cutlery on the ground, and when Yuuri picks it up, it turns out that dropping a knife is a challenge to a duel, and Yuuri has accepted by picking it up. Poor Yuuri is deeply bewildered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuuri wins the duel, and it's unclear whether having lost the duel means Wolfram isn't allowed to decline the marriage proposal, or if he just doesn't want to anymore; either way, the engagement stands.</span>
<ul><li> Fanwank is that Wolfram lost his chance to decline, and Yuuri can't back out since he already swore to never take it back. Their marital state is pretty much in limbo.
</li><li> Wolfram falls for Yuuri pretty hard before long, and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">fanatically possessive</a> of his fiancé, who is both naturally oblivious and in denial about this whole 'engaged to a guy' thing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> In a later episode a childhood friend of Wolfram's who considers them engaged due to similar circumstances appears, and Yuuri falls for the knife trick again, only this time he also accidentally points a spork at the challenger, which formally indicates that you have stolen someone's lover and intend to fight for them. Wolfram is touched.
</li><li> The writers love this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em>, Ayumu accidentally gets knocked into a female vampire, Maelstrom, and ends up kissing her on the lips. According to Maelstrom's culture, a kiss between a man and a woman constitutes a marriage, which she vows to take seriously. Underscored because at the time of said marriage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy">Ayumu was wearing a frilly pink dress and Maelstrom was wearing shorts.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as she competes with Haruna for Ayumu's attention.
</li><li> Sorta parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge">Tenjho Tenge</a></em> when Souichiro Nagi gets tossed into a dressing room when Aya Natsume was taking a shower. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedFirstimpression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedFirstimpression">He gets to see Aya naked</a>, and according to the rules of the Natsume clan this means she must devote herself to him. Cue to Aya acting like a weird mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> in regards to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate">Gate</a></em>, 33 year old Itami cares for the 15 year old Lelei and innocently sleeps in the same room with her. Little does he know that she has a crush on him and in her people's culture, a man and woman sleeping in the same room together for three or more nights in a row is a marriage. The other girls in his life are not pleased, while he is freaked out.
</li><li> In the manga <em>Kakemakumo, Kashikoki</em>, the homeless Shin Handa takes shelter from an unexpected summer shower in the shrine of a fox spirit, hungrily devours the food offering that was placed there and nonchalantly remarks that he'd "agree to become the bride of the fox spirit" if it meant he would get to eat such delicious meals everyday. Lo and behold, he's transported to the spirit world, and married to the fox spirit. Since this ISN'T a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Boys' Love</a> manga, neither of them are happy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsekaiDeKojiinWoHiraitakedoNazekaDarehitoriSudatouToShiaiKen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsekaiDeKojiinWoHiraitakedoNazekaDarehitoriSudatouToShiaiKen">Isekai De Kojiin Wo Hiraitakedo Nazeka Darehitori Sudatou To Shiai Ken</a></em>, the protagonist Shinji first makes the mistake of petting on the the head Lucia, a beast-kin, while checking to see if she's okay, after she recovered from a goblin attack and a deadly illness. She proclaims that the only people allowed to do that are her parents, and a "master" to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>.

As a result, where a normal soul bond takes years to go through the relevant three stages as the souls become acquainted, due to the side-effects of the ritual Harry and Ginny jump straight to the second stage after they meet at the station, where they are capable of communicating telepathically across great distances, and are legally considered to be married despite only being eleven and ten (although nobody knows about the marriage as they would need to read an obscure book of records in the Ministry, and Dumbledore can make arrangements to delay it being checked).

She'd been so drunk that she forgot it'd happened, and hadn't known that the presiding party-goer was legitimately authorized to perform weddings. This is particularly strange, because she finds this out while looking for a higher security clearance. Then, when she's attempting to marry Hodgins, their wedding is interrupted by someone telling her what she should have already known. For several more episodes, she tries to find her husband to get a divorce, but has no idea who he is. Doubly strange because, as she was intoxicated and doesn't really remember it, not to mention can't even remember what her husband looks like, she could get annulment without needing him, but for some reason chooses to go through various wacky hijinks to figure out who he is and get him to sign the divorce papers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When they find him and he refuses, it's treated as if she's now trapped in the marriage, even though that's not at all the case.</span>

Most of the episode deals with Kate trying to get him to sign the annulment papers. It turns out the 'husband', a small time con artist, knew what happened all along but instead of contacting Kate and getting a divorce, he has been telling people that she had an accident and has been in a coma for the last fifteen years. This way he could maintain a 'semi-married' state where he would be free to date other women but his girlfriends would not pressure him to divorce his wife and marry them.

Earl, meanwhile, was 3 weeks into a relationship with another woman named Jessie. Joy conspires with her friends to get him drunk, knowing that he wouldn't go for it if he knew she was pregnant. (Earl just thought she had a bit of a belly, not that that belly had a baby in it.) After returning from Vegas, they move into Earl's friend Frank's trailer (Earl had been Frank's roommate, but Frank wound up in prison after a heist gone wrong.) And they use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> tickets that Earl had received for his and Jessie's 3-week anniversary for their "honeymoon," during which Joy knocks out Jessie's teeth.

If the player didn't realize that the marriage had to happen, it's entirely possible for Chrom to end up <em>with someone totally different from who they were planning on pairing him up with</em>. This is sort of lampshaded if he marries Olivia, who joins the party the chapter before this happens.

So what was intended as a joke was resolved by a legal divorce. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3677927,00.html">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> It gets even weirder, because while technically those things are all part of a wedding (though you don't even need sex, just a certain amount of time alone), even if you have some of this and not all of it, there's enough of a doubt/question that you might be married that you may actually need a divorce. And since anyone above bar/bat mitzvah can theoretically get married, stories abound of prank middle-school weddings or ultra-realistic theater weddings in which, even if they didn't do the deed, major rabbinic headaches occur.
</li></ul></li><li> It seems this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/explainer/2012/11/janeane_garofalo_marriage_does_she_owe_the_irs_back_taxes_for_accidental.html">actually happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneaneGarofalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneaneGarofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>.
</li><li> In medieval Christian canon law, getting married was a matter of saying "I take you as my wife" and "I take you as my husband" — or words to that effect. (Witnesses were <em>highly recommended</em> but optional.) And when the couple had had intercourse, the courts were very lenient about what were words to that effect. Several cases turned on not what one had said, but what was meant by the words that were admitted. You see a promise of future intent "I will take you as my wife" was a legal betrothal and binding unless formally dissolved. If you followed that up with sex you were married. The opportunities for 'He said, She said' are obvious. Church courts were kept busy for centuries sorting out all the permutations. This was notably an improvement for women of many Germanic tribes, as the Church protected existing marriages. Therefore, if a woman had a sweetheart and was clever about it, she could choose her husband herself. Of course she'd then have to seek the Church's protection against her angry father...
<ul><li> The Council of Trent cleared this up for Catholics by requiring witnesses, one of whom had to be a priest unless it was impractical.
</li></ul></li><li> According to Director Francis Ford Coppola on the DVD commentary from Bram Stoker's Dracula, Mina and Jonathan's wedding was a reshoot done at a Los Angeles Greek Orthodox church. They filmed the entire ceremony with a genuine Orthodox minister and realized afterwards that Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves really were married.
</li><li> Colonial Connecticut required marriage ceremonies by a government official. A couple resident in New Haven insisted they were married without it and refused to have the ceremony; probably Quakers, who were still going by the medieval rules. One official caught them in the street and reproachfully demanded first of him and then of her whether they really took each other as wife/husband. He then pronounced them married, making them married by the law. The bridegroom conceded that it was a good one.
<ul><li> In some states, like Pennsylvania, it's still legal to get married without an officiant present, although the couple still has to get a marriage license beforehand.
</li></ul></li><li> In some states (e.g. Colorado) that allow common law marriages it is possible to wind up married to someone merely by referring to them as your spouse, provided all the other conditions have been met (cohabitation, holding themselves to be a couple in the eyes of the community, etc.)
