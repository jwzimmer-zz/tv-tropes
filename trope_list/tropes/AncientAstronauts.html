Often these aliens are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">sufficiently advanced</a>.
</p><p>When this trope kicks in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsSpaceJesus">expect various myths to be related to aliens</a>. Everyone knows about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">Clarke's Third Law</a>: the <em>many</em> legends of magic, gods, beings coming from the sky and the like were based on alien technology that we could not comprehend at that time.
</p><p>Proponents of this theory also espouse that ancient construction projects like the pyramids and Stonehenge are clearly too advanced and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">a little too fantastic</a> for ancient man to have constructed without help from a more advanced civilization. Or that since there are pyramids in the Americas, Egypt, and China... you guessed it, they all got their idea from aliens. Other popular sites include the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai">Moai of Easter Island</a> and the Nazca Lines.

After all, it's not like either aliens <em>or</em> ancient humans would be interesting enough to write fiction about on their own, without them interacting, would they?

When that project failed, he remained on Earth, mating with humans and leaving his technology in the ruins of the tower for the first of his descendants who proved to be worthy enough.

</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is what the demons actually are—aliens. Their world was destroyed for an unexplained reason, so they came to earth to settle—but crashed their spaceship during entry, and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. They then spent so much time on Earth that they even forgot their origins</span>.
</li><li> It's hinted that Kabapu and Il Palazzo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> (and possibly Excel herself and the Ropponmatsu), are connected to a lost civilization called Solaria, which may well be an example of this. Particularly as Tenmangu Shiouji didn't believe their technology could be created on Earth. And if it can't be created on Earth that kind of leaves only one option...
<ul><li> Shiouji's son Goujo actually states this Trope by name while ridiculing the idea that Kabapu's claims as to his origins are true.
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga <em>Paradise on the Sand</em>, the ruling class of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">unnamed pseudo-Middle Eastern country</a> in which the story is set believe that they once lived in Heaven with the gods, but were eventually banished, and told that if they kept their blood pure they would one day be allowed to return. In addition, the enigmatic character Raisa is heavily hinted to be a goddess come to check up on them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They came from the heavens, all right — in a spaceship. And Raisa is indeed there to check up on them, but a goddess she's not (though she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">sufficiently advanced</a> to be mistaken for one). The blood purity thing was all their invention, though.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spriggan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spriggan">Spriggan</a></em>, one of Yu Ominae's missions in Mexico reveals that the gods the Mexicans worship in the old days are actually ancient astronauts. With some exceptions.
<ul><li> Not to forget an early chapter/in the OVA movie in which ARCAM scientists discover Noah's ark <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ancient space ship which has the ability to directly control the Earth's atmosphere and is heavily implied to be the source of all life that has, is and will be on Earth</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> this appears as well (to some extent). Although never explained in detail a number of technologically advanced winged humanoids lived on the Moon (the Skypieans, Shandians and Bilkan), when resources ran out they departed the moon. Upon initially seeing them they were mistaken for angels, and their shadows (from those that lived in the clouds) were often mistaken by sailors as being the silhouettes of giants.
</li><li> The Protoculture of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> are presented as such in the prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em>, when it's revealed they have influenced the culture of the people of Mayan Island (it's also hinted they interbred with them) so they would be able to activate an artifact (the "Bird Human") that would either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">bomb mankind back into stone age if they reached space before renouncing war</a> or provide Protoculture technology if they did renounce war.

<ul><li> Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em>, it's revealed that the Protoculture had a presence on the homeworlds of several other species, including, but not limited to, the natives of the Brisingr Globular Cluster, leaving behind several powerful artifacts that drive much of the plot.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> this is the explanation given for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Oyashiro-Sama and the virus causing Hinamizawa Syndrome</span> during Tsumihoroboshi. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However it's not quite accurate.</span>
</li><li> The Nitro's from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> are heavily implied as being this, if the hieroglyphics in the Gourmet Palace are a given.
</li><li> Kyubey aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Incubators</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> invokes this as the result of their intervention, with human civilization, science and progress as the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sacrifice of Magical Girls and various historical figures such as Cleopatra herself making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> with them</span>. He even comments that if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madoka</span> wishes that they never existed, then humans would "still be living naked in caves."
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Life Fibers</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> are responsible for mankind evolving to the point that they wore clothing, manipulating civilizations for their harvest of energy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> does this a few times:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa">Kappa</a> that ghost girl Omiyo befriended long ago was really a Keronian scout wearing a helmet that made his head look like a kappa's.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in one episode of the anime, which revealed that various sites attributed to ancient aliens were actually amusement park attractions: Stonehenge is a giant solar-powered stove, Macchu Picchu was the site of a giant roller coaster, the Pyramid of Giza is a haunted house, and the Moai heads of Easter Island are a giant game of whack-a-mole.
</li><li> The manga had a more serious interpretation of Easter Island, where the Moai were there to seal away evil spirits (read: ancient alien invaders).
</li></ul></li><li> In the H-manga <em>Dulce Report</em>, the aliens, codenamed "Angels", have been interacting with humanity for over six thousand years in order to create Human-Angel hybrids for an unknown reason. The fact that much of the lore includes real-life conspiracies such as the Dulce Air Force Base and even Alburquian businessman Paul Bennewitz was used, though changed into a British geneticist to fit the story, is what makes the story a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornWithPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornWithPlot">Porn with Plot</a> manga.

It was left ambiguous as to whether the Asgardians had influenced early viking culture, or vice versa. The idea was abandoned by subsequent writers, who opted to continue portraying the Asgardians as explicitly supernatural entities. Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">whether this distinction is actually important</a> is debatable; the Asgardians clearly <em>are</em> advanced people who came from another planet to Earth in the past and interacted with more primitive humans.

It is hinted at pretty heavily, and it turns out that Earth has been visited by aliens countless times throughout history (FYI: Aliens killed the dinosaurs. With an asteroid. That they were using to attack <em>other</em> aliens that had settled on Earth. Oh, and those first aliens? They were ants.), but each time a major revelation is set up it is immediately torn apart. Erek, a Chee (ageless android living in disguise amongst humanity), reveals that he helped build the pyramids. When he is given shocked stares at the revelation that he created the darn things he laughs it off and explains that he was a slave who helped haul the bricks, he had nothing to do with the planning, engineering, or logistics of the project (He did, however, cut and style Catherine the Great's hair a few <strike>centuries</strike> millennia later). Despite all the aliens who seem inexplicably drawn to our blue planet, all the credit (and the blame) of our history goes to us.

Spaceships are forbidden to trade with cultures that don't have anything to offer. A quick scan of the planet convinces most of the crew that humans are just a simple hunter-gatherer society, but the trader's instinct says that they do have something to offer. Played straight in that the traders do help them, giving them the wheel and tools, but the traders gain something by learning to use caricature and sketches from the human's ancient art. Sketches have an advantage of highlighting characteristics that are important, and getting rid of information that is unimportant.

They call this pristine world Pearl and establish a compound on an island. They plant the seeds of a salad plant known as ambrosia from Oll, and the plant grows overnight. They eat it, grow sick, and collapse.

They end up ruling over the dark-haired primitives on the island, with male Ollans impregnating many local females, resulting in varied hair colors. The locals build them a palace on top of a large hill at the center of the island. The Ollans call it Oll-lympus. The island they call in honor of their home country Atl back on Oll - Atl-antis. Long story short, a vision warns them of a comet about to strike the sea and sink the island. A number of the locals and the Ollans manage to get away to the mainland. They survive to the present day and secretly use their amassed fortune to finance research into re-creating their teleportation device (which was left behind on Oll, and its use resulted in a nuclear war, making them the last Ollans).
<ul><li> For bonus points, the name of the Ollan security guard, who became the military leader of Atl-antis, training locals in hand-to-hand combat and tactics, as well as having them build ships and weapons for conquest of the mainland, is Mars Ares.

The nation's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodKing">God King</a> is deposed after a shocking prophecy proclaims the arrival of a new God: it specifies that God has one eye, is white as snow, and that a great house will fall and burn.

In the midst of this civil war, the sky is lit by a bright streak like a falling star. The thing that burned and fell is a great house, and figures emerge from it.

<div class="indent"> "They were white all over, and hairless. Their heads had no mouth or nose and one huge single staring shining lidless eye. ...

The sole apparent exception is Londo, who says he sees nothing (given Centauri have telepaths and they're evidence of Vorlon meddling, he could have been lying.

The Andromedans are the ones who put the weapon there in the first place millennia ago, but now it threatens their refugee fleet on its way past the Solar System to their new home. Even worse, when charged to full power, the weapon will not only destroy the fleet but will also create a supervolcano-like eruption, effectively destroying human civilization. The weapon is protected by the Guardian. The alien boy attempts to defeat the Guardian but is shot instead. In the end, the main heroine realizes that humans are (at least, in part) descendants of the Andromedans to came to install the cannon. Thus, she is able to deactivate the Guardian and stop the weapon.

<ul><li> Ma'el, a Taelon scientist, traveled to Earth thousands of years ago in order to determine if humans could be turned into soldiers to be used in the Taelon-Jaridian War. However, once here, Ma'el grew fond of humanity and changed his mind, sending a warning message to the other Taelons, telling them not to come. He also gave some humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> in order to foster better communication between the races. As revealed in the episode, where Liam and Augur end up in a parallel world, Ma'el also encouraged humans to urbanize, believing that it was the only way for humanity to develop the necessary industrial and scientific infrastructure necessary to resist his people, should they ignore his warning and come anyway. In a last-ditch effort, he befriended a Roman man and tasked him with acting as his scout through the ages, sleeping in the stasis pod aboard Ma'el's buried ship, periodically waking up in order to assess the state of humanity and look for any alien presence. Should the Taelons ever arrive and prove to be harmful to humanity, the Roman is to activate the ship's final protocol, causing it to lift off and accelerate on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">collision course</a> with the Taelon mothership. In the above-mentioned parallel world, Ma'el never comes to Earth, and his previously-militant attitude ends up influencing the modern-day Taelons to outright invade Earth instead of attempting to subvert humanity covertly. Meanwhile, that world's humanity never urbanized and lives in scattered hamlets, although they have somehow managed to develop advanced weaponry due to the constant fighting between the settlements.
</li><li> Season 5 also reveals that prehistoric humanity used to be enslaved and kept as food by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Atavus</a>, the common ancestors of the Taelons and the Jaridians. It's speculated that their leader Howlyn was so impressed with Renee (when she used a time-traveling ID portal to end up in the past) that he used the dead body of a Medieval monk to enhance the DNA of primitive cavemen to speed up their evolution into <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> (i.e. modern humans). Then a meteor storm forced the Atavus into slumber, allowing humanity to rise.

</li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV">seaQuestDSV</a></em> involve tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Grey</a>-like aliens, capable of walking through walls (they're actually "silicon projections"). In one episode, they possess the bodies of several <em>seaQuest</em> crewmembers and head to a Native American reservation, where it's revealed that the aliens have been to Earth before, long ago, and made contact with a Native American tribe.

At first they don't even recognize humans as intelligent and don't want to communicate with them. They are interested only in the intelligent species that was around way back then and with which they had interaction - Dolphins. So in fact they turn out to be Ancient Astronauts to the Dolphins long before Humans.

</li><li> The crew of <em>Space Island One</em> encounter a Babylonian space probe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> (and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>) takes this to its logical extreme.
<ul><li> Virtually every culture's gods or mythic figures (right up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>) have, in the course of the show, been revealed to be inspired or co-opted by aliens of one form or another. Mostly, they were the Goa'uld, which began as the Egyptian gods and spread from there, though the benevolent Asgard were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse gods</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin">Merlin</a> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a>. The Goa'uld were evicted from Earth several thousand years before the beginning of Christianity, although at least one group of early Christians were transplanted to another world by an unknown party, eventually evolving into a medieval society under the domain of Sokar, who co-opted the image of the Devil for his own purposes.
</li><li> This was alluded to when Daniel explained how there is a point in human history where humans suddenly stopped worshiping fire (a representation of the Ori) and started worshiping pure white light (a representation of the Ancients, which are angelic)
</li><li> SG-1 have also shown some Goa'uld posing as Greek Titans and Oriental gods, as well as Mayan crystal skulls as alien communication devices, and Aztec having their own alien descendants and ancestors. For example, the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl is a giant alien made out of smoke. However, Lord Zipacna posed as a Mayan deity of the same name, meaning not all Mesoamerican deities were "giant aliens".
<ul><li> Quetzalcoatl isn't actually made of smoke. He and his kind just existed in a different phase from us where they couldn't be seen. The crystal skull artifact *partially* shifted humans into his phase, where they could interact with him, but not completely. The humans probably looked like smoke to him too.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> One episode had the characters find themselves in what appeared to be a standard medieval Christian society, leading them to briefly discuss the possibility that a Goa'uld is posing as the Judeo-Christian God or even Christ. It's <em>Teal'c</em> who dismisses this idea first, having read the Bible and come to the conclusion that no Goa'uld would act as compassionate and benevolent as the one featured within, as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">couldn't even comprehend such behavior</a>. It turns out that the Goa'uld who rules the planet impersonates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a></em> instead.
</li><li> The lost city of Atlantis wasn't sunk or lost: it launched into space and traveled to another Galaxy, eventually settling on a new planet. And <em>then</em> it was sunk, in order to hide it from the Wraith. The remaining Ancients traveled from Atlantis back to earth and presumably told the story of Atlantis to the ancient Greeks. Only leaving out that it was on another planet, in another galaxy.

</li><li> In the episode "Blink of an Eye", the <em>crew of Voyager</em> become Ancient Astronauts to a civilization on a planet that exists in enormously accelerated time; from the viewpoint of the planet, Voyager is in their sky for the sum total of civilization, and eventually they advance their technology to the point where they can go out into space to meet them. The aliens didn't know about the time dilation and by the time the explorers make contact it's more than a generation later on the planet and they start trying to shoot down the alien ship that so callously destroyed their peaceful explorers. A secondary motivation was that <em>Voyager's</em> presence was acting as a third pole for the planet, giving it frequent earthquakes. The ship is only saved when one of the explorers goes back to explain things, then returns to <em>Voyager</em> with ships specifically built to move Voyager out and break the time acceleration.
</li><li> "Dragon's Teeth" involves a race of aliens who used a naturally occurring network of dimensional tunnels to carve out an empire. When their oppressed subjects eventually overthrew them, some retreated into cryostasis to wait for a more opportune time. By the time of the series, most cultures in the Delta Quadrant only remember them as cruel trickster demons in a few very old legends. For reference, in the time they ruled (about 900 years before the series timeline), they remember the Borg as being mostly harmless and confined to a few systems.
</li><li> Then there are the Voth, who are descended from dinosaurs, having evolved on Earth millions of years ago and leaving during a cataclysm. After traveling for who knows how long, they settled in the Delta Quadrant and forgot their origins, with their official doctrine claiming that they are the first sentient beings to evolve in that part of space. To say otherwise is heresy. While they are undoubtedly more advanced than the Federation, they are not "millions of years" more advanced.

The Imperium of Man and Adeptus Mechanicus think they have the right idea and enforce it galaxy-wide...
<ul><li> Another interesting twist from the setting are that humans are the Ancient Astronauts to other species. The Tau are one of the few species this happened to and who still exist; the ancient technology that the Tau found? A <em>human</em> ship that was supposed to wipe them out but was caught in a warpstorm. However, most other primitive species found by the Imperium tend to die via xenophobic planet cleansing.
</li><li> Also applies to the Eldar and Orks, who were either manipulated or outright created by the Old Ones to help in their war against the Necrons. The Eldar in particular inherited much of the remains of the Old Ones' technology, particularly the Webway which allows them to travel through the setting's version of hyperspace safely (quite important when hyperspace is also Hell). It's also hinted that the same may be true for humanity, or alternatively that we may have been influenced by the C'tan - essentially the Necron's gods.

The "Old Ones" were a mysterious species that came from the cosmos in silver ships, they colonized the world and reshaped it into its current form. Knowing Chaos would one day appear in this reality and attempt to consume it, they started creating races with the objective of keeping Chaos at bay and even one day defeat them. They first created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizardmen</a> as their servants, workers and soldiers, led by the powerful Slann, with their temple-cities built in a way to create a geomantic web, an interlinked matrix of natural earth-energy that encompassed the planet. The Old Ones would also create the other species from the setting: First, they created Elves, who were given mastery of magic, but they decided the Elves could not beat Chaos alone due to being frail and having a low birth rate. Then, they created the Dwarfs, who were higly resistant to magic and chaos corruption, but were too stubborn and would not adapt fast enough in the face of demon trickery. The next race created was Humanity, who had the magical aptitude of the Elves, the durability of the Dwarfs, and having a lot of adaptability of their own, however, they were extremly corruptible to the powers of Chaos due their short lifespan and ambition. Finally, their last were the Ogres, created by combining the best aspects of Men, Dwarfs and Elves, in addition to this, they are able to survive on just about any food, from meat to tree trunks to rocks. However, before their were properly instructed by the Old Ones, the forces of Chaos invaded the world and the Old Ones dissapeared mysteriously.

Humans <em>never</em> accomplished <em>anything</em> on their own, and are at best, sidekicks, and at worst, <em>dogs</em>.
<ul><li> Well, that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">1st Edition</a>. In second edition this was dialed back <em>a lot</em>. Most of human history was done and dreamed up by humans, but then heavily influenced by the various supernaturals. It would have happened anyway, just differently. There were still exceptions though, two warring Vampire clans caused the Punic Wars, Werewolves probably wiped out the Ranoke colony and (probably the biggest one) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanIsGood">Lucifer created Christianity</a>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, many vampires claim that their clan's antediluvian poised as some god or another (the Toreador antediluvian was Inanna, and the Gangrel antediluvian was Ereshkigal, for instance).

<ul><li> Some writers have proposed that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Such visitors are called ancient astronauts or ancient aliens. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of human cultures, technologies and religions. Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut is based on this concept.
</li><li> Chronomaly Mayan Machine is based on the "Maya Astronaut" of K'inich Janaab' Pakal, a ruler of the Mayan polity of Palenque. The Palenque Astronaut appears to depict a man controlling a spaceship. This ornately decorated five ton stone was discovered in 1952 in Chiapas, Mexico covering the Tomb of the Mayan King Pacal, at the Temple of Palenque ~ the only known Mayan Pyramid to contain a Tomb, as seems the case throughout Egypt

There is a sidequest planet that tells you that that the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Protheans</a> studied early humans, though there is no evidence that humanity actually worshiped them, and the only advancements in tech that humanity got from them were the high-tech ruins found on Mars. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">hanar</a>, a different alien race, do worship the Protheans, due to the fact that, according to their mythology, the Protheans taught them speech, and possibly made them sentient.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, the Forerunners interfered with a number of other species, including humanity. However, that time came and went long before humanity kept records (about 100,000 years ago), and the Forerunners did not leave much on Earth to uncover (with the exception of the portal to the Ark), though it's strongly implied that our ancient flood myths (like Noah and his Ark) were directly based on the conclusion of the Forerunner-Flood War. However, the Forerunners left plenty of easily-found relics on other worlds, causing the Covenant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">worship them as gods</a>.
<ul><li> It was seemingly implied that Forerunners were actually humans, what with 343 Guilty Spark believing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">the first game</a> that he had somehow already talked to the Master Chief in the prehistoric past and the fact that much of Forerunner technology can only be activated by humans, among many other things, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloCryptum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloCryptum">Halo: Cryptum</a></em> revealed that Forerunners were actually a separate species who were simply somewhat biologically related to humans. In fact, "prehistoric" humans had independently developed their own advanced interstellar empire, but ended up losing a war with the Forerunners. In the aftermath, humanity was stripped of its technology and forcibly devolved back to the Stone Age. Eventually though, some Forerunners decided that humanity might be worthy of inheriting their legacy after all (hence why humans can activate Forerunner tech more easily than other species). Guilty Spark's seemingly faulty memory might be due to the Forerunner geas (heritable genetic commands) placed on various human lineages, one of which apparently shares some relation with the Master Chief.
</li><li> The San'Shyuum (AKA Prophets) had not only made contact with the Forerunners, but had actually fought against them alongside their own allied species... <em>humans</em> (how's that for irony?). After being defeated, the San'Shyuum at first got off somewhat easier than their human allies, as they were simply confined to just two planets from their former empire, but their advanced civilization was later wiped out when they tried to rebel against the Forerunners. Ironically, their descendants began <em>worshiping</em> the Forerunners, with one of their breakaway sects eventually founding the Covenant. Nonetheless, their near-extinction left a traumatic cultural memory, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloBrokenCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloBrokenCircle">Halo: Broken Circle</a></em> implying that the reason why non-Covenant San'Shyuum are so technologically conservative (to the point where they refuse to study Forerunner ruins) is because they fear that their gods will punish them if they become too advanced.

However, there are signs in their history that a few of their number found their way to the surface long ago and commingled with humans. It's probable that descendants of the stone-loving D'ni had something to do with the building of the pyramids and other ancient constructions, and modern "explorers" who ventured into the D'ni cavern in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst">Uru</a></em> and found a home there are strong callbacks to this original lineage.

<ul><li> Evoked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">hilariously</a> in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roa1ei6Lm-s">this clip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks">Tom Hanks</a> when presented with a birthday present.
</li><li> The idea was heavily popularized by <em>Chariots Of The Gods</em>, as mentioned above. The book was published in 1968 by Erich von Däniken, and quickly became a bestseller. It was copied lots of times, was made into at least two movies, and led to the Ancient Astronauts plot showing up in several of the examples here, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Before Däniken there was</a> Italian <a class="urllink" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peter_Kolosimo">Peter Kolosimo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (19221984), whose best-selling books such as <em>Terra senza tempo</em> ("Timeless Earth") were the first ones to present these kinds of ideas. In fact, Kolosimo was <em>the</em> major influencer of Däniken (read: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Plagiarism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Plagiarism">Däniken ripped off Kolosimo</a>). He was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Dirty Communist</a> who quoted heavily from Soviet "authorities" - which plays into who heavily promoted this in the first place. After his death, he went into obscurity and his books are no longer published, but due to Däniken and later Tsoukalos his ideas will be in pop culture and pseudoscience/conspiracy-circle currency for a long, long time.
<ul><li> Actually Däniken ripped off a lot of people. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Charroux">Robert Charroux<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_of_the_Magicians">Louis Pauwels &amp; Jacques Bergier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinsley_Le_Poer_Trench,_8th_Earl_of_Clancarty">Brinsley Le Poer Trench<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> all wrote pre-<em>Chariots of the Gods?</em> books touting the theory that Däniken pretty clearly borrowed from as well.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope parodied by <a class="urllink" href="http://controversy.wearscience.com/design/ufo/">this shirt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from "Teach the Controversy."
</li><li> One extremely popular variant of this trope is the claim that the ancient civilization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> consisted of expatriate aliens.
<ul><li> The absolute masterpiece of the early paranormal movement, the 1970s <em>The Bermuda Triangle</em> by Charles Berlitz, explores this angle. No sarcasm here: if you want to read about Alien Astronauts in the context of abandoned Atlantean technology causing planes to fall out of the sky, this is where you want to go.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a book by a certain Wolfgang Volkrodt suggesting that von Däniken is wrong - gods of old weren't aliens, only a secretive elite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">technology users</a>, awing the lesser people with "LOOK AT ME BALLOON I'M A GOD." The guy, being an engineer, even provides plans for their steam engines.
<ul><li> A similar theory states that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientHumans">highly technological ancient civilization</a>" wasn't aliens, only Atlanteans and possibly Lemurians, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">blew themselves to smithereens</a> long ago.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidIcke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidIcke">David Icke</a>'s book <em>The Biggest Secret</em> is a conspiracy theory claiming that not only did reptilian aliens found the great ancient civilizations of Earth, they also continue to rule the Earth from the shadows. Apparently they don't mind the masses knowing that they rule secretly, since they allowed the publication of that book. Either that or the reptilian data is misinformation fed to Icke, in order to discredit him as he got too close to the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Illuminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Illuminati">Illuminati</a> (some conspiracy theorists who find his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reptilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reptilians">reptilians</a> theory too much for even them have claimed this).
</li><li> You can find a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/architecture/salamanca.asp">carving of an astronaut<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Cathedral,_Salamanca">New Cathedral of Salamanca<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, built in the 16th century. Ancient astronauts? No. The engraving was created in 1992 by one of the artisans restoring the cathedral, continuing the tradition of church builders and restorers including a contemporary symbol as a "signature" of their work.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://cathedral.org/what-to-see/exterior/vader/">The National Cathedral<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Darth Vader</a> Grotesque. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Stone By Day, Dark Lord of the Sith by Night</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> The theory of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">panspermia/exogenesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> posits that Earth's life has an extra-terrestrial origin, but a good portion of these theories are less "extraterrestrials intentionally planted the seeds for life on Earth" and more "meteorites with the chemicals needed to develop life happened to smash into Earth from somewhere else in the universe."
</li><li> Bible scholar <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sitchin.com/">Zechariah Sitchin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> firmly believed this is a fact. His supposed source? The Bible itself. His works, <em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series, detailed his studies and interpretations.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera_in_Scientology#Scientology.27s_chronology_of_the_universe">Scientology<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, anyone?
</li><li> At least one guy believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">America invaded Iraq</a> for Ancient Alien artifacts, namely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.exopolitics.org/Study-Paper2.htm">No, really.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</em> from Japanese folklore is considered by many literary scholars to be the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> story, with Princess Kaguya (who came from the moon) being an Ancient Astronaut.
</li><li> The theory has been somewhat debunked regarding Stonehenge. A man working by himself is building a replica in his backyard using nothing but simple machines (mostly levers). He has proven that aliens didn't <em>need</em> to be involved. The other claims are similarly rejected by mainstream scientists.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visoki_De&lt;!--C4--&gt;8Dani">Visoki Decani<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a 14th century Serbian monastery, contains an icon of the Crucifixion with what looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.srbinside.rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freskevi.jpg">two UFOs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Notable alien conspiracy theorists, like Erich von Däniken, have for decades considered this to be an evidence of UFO presence in medieval history. This "theory" was, of course, dismissed by the priests, who offered a more Biblical explanation of the painting.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirius_Mystery">The Sirius Mystery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> by Robert Temple (1976) argued that the Dogon people of Mali knew that Sirius had a white dwarf companion star long before astronomers made that discovery, and that they could only have learned it from visitors from a planet that orbits Sirius. Experts dismiss this theory, but there's no consensus as to how the Dogon actually acquired their knowledge (either they could've learned it from 19th century contact with French astronomers, or the anthropological studies that Temple got his information from were flawed and garbled the actual Dogon mythology about Sirius).
</li><li> There are apparently some old archaeology that show some very weird things including: so-called <a class="urllink" href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Helicopter_hieroglyphs">Helicopter hieroglyphs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at Abydos in Egypt, stone glyphs depicting a story about the Anunnaki (inhabitants of the planet Nibiru) mentioned in ancient Sumerian texts, a votive relief of the winged priest of Dudu at the Louvre, Hindu depictions of Vimanas, and the Dogu figurines in Japan. <a class="urllink" href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Ancient_astronaut_hypothesis">More on that here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> A lot of these theories are based on older, explicitly racist ideas to explain why different ruins in the Americas or Africa "obviously" were not built by Native Americans and Africans, but lost white people. Naturally, as you'd expect the racist versions of these are still popular <a class="urllink" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/01/02/close-encounters-racist-kind">in certain circles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though even if not explicit <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/how-to-fake-an-alien-mummy/535251/">they can be harmful<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
