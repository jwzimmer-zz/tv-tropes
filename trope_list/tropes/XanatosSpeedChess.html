</div></div><p>Some characters have an amazing gift not only for making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> but for revising it whenever new circumstances arise. Even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> does not prevent this character working around it to success.
</p><p>While the plots can be  or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASimplePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASimplePlan">become</a>  as complex as anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> (or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>) lays out, they tend to function differently. The plotting character tends to be more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a>. We usually follow, if not the plotter themself, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">characters near them</a>, so we can witness their continual and brilliant improvisations. The plotter is more likely to be a hero than a villain because the plot is always teetering at the edge of failure, making its success more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">dramatic</a>. If it is used by both sides, the drama is squared.

Indeed, many players start with a plan as simple as possible because that introduces as few things as possible to go wrong. Closely related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a>, which has simpler goals like "escape" or sometimes "hope for the best", but in this case, the plan is still in operation, just modified to fit new situations. The distinction here is that Xanatos Speed Chess involves changing an existing plan quickly, while an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a> started with <em>no</em> plan whatsoever.
</p><p>A much more dangerous form of it is to alter the plan to take advantage of unexpected windfalls. This usually introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation">exploitable flaws</a>, and if it does not lead to disaster, it can come very close.

</p><p>Contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a>, where the planner incorporates events that they would have no way of foreseeing into his plans  they rely on chance as much as on brilliance. Contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockKing">Clock King</a>, a consummate planner who is rarely good at this. If prophecy, time travel, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">being able to see the future</a> is involved, may escalate to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScryVsScry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScryVsScry">Scry vs. Scry</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalBackupPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalBackupPlan">Unintentional Backup Plan</a>  where something completely unexpected occurs to help the plan  though it can still be adapted into this.

</li><li> It is difficult to know how much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi">Akagi</a>'s playing is this and how much he actually plans out. In any case, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Aizen and Urahara have been opposing each other for a century. As they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmasters</a>, their entire battle has consisted of elaborately designed plans and constant revision of those plans as first one then the other gains the upper hand. From Aizen framing Urahara for catching him red-handed, to Urahara using his exile to set up an elaborate protection of the Hougyoku. From Aizen losing the element of surprise and thus having to prepare for war in one month instead of four, to Urahara anticipating exactly that and setting up a series of secret kidou traps to ensure Aizen is depowered by Ichigo in the end...most of the characters freely admit they can't keep up and eventually even Aizen is forced to admit he can't keep up with Urahara's intelligence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, Aleister Crowley constantly uses this so that whenever something unexpected happens, he weaves it in to complete his plans even faster. But even Crowley cannot keep up with everything: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shiage Hamazura defeating Mugino caused a domino reaction that <em>completely</em> threw his plans all out of whack, and he's now desperately attempting to get everything back under his control.</span>
</li><li> Lelouch Lamperouge from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> does this out of necessity, because the writers love screwing all of his plans by unexpected events that no sane person would ever consider. He turned the tables when pitted against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Britannian</a> military and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their Chinese allies</span> right after losing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his best fighter</span> and a large part of his army.

<ul><li> Light Yagami, when things first started to get out of hand, but it didn't last. Misa forced more Speed Chess on him than anyone else; sometimes by being smarter than he expected but usually by being impulsive. Before long Light could flawlessly predict even her actions.
</li><li> L was also good at Speed Chess, but not as good as Light. A major unexpected twist once left L at a loss for weeks, although this was simply due to not knowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">all the details of Kira's power</a>.
</li><li> Near and Mello are also masters of this trope because they were raised in the same way and for the same purpose as L.

</li><li> It's not just Conan who pulls this off. The other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">high-school detectives</a> do this regularly.
</li><li> And, of course, the absolute winner of this trope is Kaitou Kid (originally from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito">Magic Kaito</a></em>),- who is constantly changing his heist plans (which are, more often than not, successful).

First, he instigates Ken into becoming the Digimon Emperor in order to plant Dark Towers to weaken the borders between worlds. When Ken undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Oikawa has Arukenimon and Mummymon try and destroy the Destiny Stones to do that. When <em>that</em> fails, he decides to create a portal from Earth by implanting kids with Dark Spores copied from the one inside Ken, then harnessing their power once they've peaked. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to BlackWarGreymon sealing the door to the Digital World, he ends up going to an entirely different world where emotions become powerwhich still helps Myotismon come back to life!</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>
<ul><li> In a series largely defined by the physical strength of its heroes and villains, Cell stands out. He is the first (and last) seasonal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who is <em>not</em> introduced as already having an overwhelming power advantage over everyone else, with the Kami-powered Piccolo fighting him to a draw in their first meeting (and Piccolo probably would have won if Cell hadn't had the tactical sense to retreat). He travels from city to city, patiently absorbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> until he has a power surpassing that of Piccolo and the androids and only <em>then</em> does he challenge them. Later, when his plans are disrupted by the arrival of Vegeta and Trunks, his initial reaction is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">throw a tantrum</a>, but after getting that out of his system he quickly demonstrates his Speed Chess skills by breaking out the only advantage he has left — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Vegeta's ego</a>. Ultimately his is one of the closest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">Near-Villain Victory</a> examples in the entire series, and the <em>only</em> reason he is ultimately defeated is because of his own success, as after becoming perfect he no longer has a purpose other than battle, and so foolishly goads Gohan until the young Saiyan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">unleashes his true power</a>...
</li><li> Super Buu is also very good at doing this, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">mere thug</a> in personality. He noticed Gohan's growing power, so he fought against Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks and tested the limits of his strength and his weaknesses (e.g. fusion limit). After briefly fighting Gohan and finding himself overwhelmed, he goes through an intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown">Super-Power Meltdown</a>, knowing he will regenerate and buys time (and getting Goten and Trunks to recuperate, to fuse again). When he returns he goads Goten and Trunks into fusing again at full power and absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo into his being, deciding 30 minutes is more than enough to handle Gohan (he was right). Goku arrives and the fusion breaks down. Goku says Gohan alone is strong enough to defeat Buu, but then Buu reveals that he planned for this eventuality as well, and had a piece of himself ready to absorb Gohan the whole time, who he goaded into standing still until it was too late. Interestingly, the only character this didn't work on is Vegito, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">too strong</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">too wily</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">and had plans of his own</a>, as he later found out...

Izaya is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> who spends great amounts of the series pulling strings to cause everything to fall into chaos. He regularly employs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambits</a> with a high success rate and to most appears to always come out on top.

In fact, his original plan was that he and his agents would create turmoil, draw the occupation out for months or even years, and cause enough pressure to cow the Senate into electing him. Almost everything after Amidala turned up on Coruscant was improvisation and moving up the timetable considerably. <br/><br/>Plus, he and Banking Clan big shot Hego Damask (alias <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis">Darth Plagueis</a>) meant for Amidala to be a martyr.

They destroyed the ship, but not before it took two tripods with it and defended the escaping refugee vessels.

He couldn't let those be destroyed, so he has to rearrange forces that were in retreat to rescue them, while still preserving as much of his fleet as possible. And he does.
<div class="indent"> The tactic he needed clicked into Wedge's mind.

<ul><li> His best example comes from week 5. Julie announced that only the veto winner or the head of household would be safe. Despite Kevin not being on anybody's radar at that point, he proceeds to actually put effort into winning the competitions. When he wins the veto he doesn't use it so that even if the nominations are changed, he can't go up. Once the nominations are changed, Kevin takes the opportunity to get rid of Jessie (the head of his alliance) so he would not have to go after him later.

Similarily to Xena, Buffy has a talent for this, notably in the episode "Helpless" she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> replaced the water in a Vampire's water bottle with holy water. When the Vampire took his painkillers with the holy water, it burned through, and killed him</span>.
</li><li> Michael Westen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> is a master at this trope, sometimes pulling off two per episode (one for helping his clients, and another for gaining more information on the people who burned him, although the latter ones don't always succeed). Because the first plan never goes as expected he has to make changes on the fly, often with little or no communication with his team about the new plan.
<ul><li> In one episode Michael faces off against a guy so smart that the entire episode consists entirely of Michael coming up with modifications of modifications of his original plans. The beauty being that Michael sets things up such that, even though the guy KNOWS Michael's playing him, he has no choice but to play along.
</li><li> The scene where he first meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Victor</a> actually takes place in a chess park.

</li><li> There's another great example in "Question and Answer", in the "reverse-interrogation" scene. Michael's undercover as a junkie snitch, Sam as a corrupt cop, and they have to let the bad guy interrogate Michael about information <em>neither of them have</em>. The entire scene is Sam playing head games with the bad guy, while Michael pretends to know information he doesn't, and pull it off.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> is made of this trope. Rarely, if ever, does the IMF's complex plot go completely according to plan. The IMF team simply improvises around whatever does go awry, and eventually achieves its goal anyway. Of course, there were several instances where the audience thought this was happening, but it was really just the plan working perfectly (for instance, when the bad guy becoming wise to the con was actually part of the con). This trope only kicks in for them when their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> is about to go awry, which is roughly once an episode.

Rollin was specifically sent in without a plan because the mission was to recover a wire recording that an agent had hidden in the few minutes between losing his tail and his death. With no one knowing where he had hidden it, they had to rely on Rollin figuring out how to find it, how to recover it, how to return it, and do it all under the eyes of enemy agents.
</li><li> Michael Scofield of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em> is excellent with this.

However, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">various interventions</a> even his large gambits such as the Fox River prison break are always threatened to be ruined unless Michael plays some speed chess.
</li><li> Emily Thorne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em> spends her days manipulating people into manipulating each other, but when this doesn't always go to plan, Emily will adjust her plans accordingly. In the second season episode <em>Penance</em>, no less than three people go rogue on her (two of which do so in order to commit homicide). She adjusts her scheme mid-episode without breaking stride, and still comes out getting exactly what she wanted all along.

</li><li> Having a Mensa-level I.Q. certainly helps. And he <em>does</em> beat Rodney in chess at least once. It helps that Sheppard's intelligence is highly focused on tactical scenarios (being military), whereas Rodney's genius applies to much different subjects, while he also suffers from overconfidence and a tendency to make poorly-considered mistakes (especially in cases where significant foresight is required — Rodney very much lives in the moment). It's entirely possible (if not likely) that even Ronon could beat Rodney in a game like chess, especially since Rodney would probably be thinking of ten different things during the game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> God Cyric. His claim to master of Xanatos Speed Chess comes during a Trial where the other gods claim he is unfit for his duty as Greater God of Strife, Lies, Murder, and other nasty things due his (fake) holding of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> for years. The thing is, Cyric SET UP the trial as a way to get the gods to bow down and worship him through use of the Cyrinishad, his book of evil that convinced anyone, god or mortal, that Cyric was the greatest god ever and only true god. When his lackey failed to get the Cyrinishad on time and had the wrong book, Cyric immediately had two other ways of assuring he would win the Trial. And he did. One was the aforementioned lackey being made into a demi-god of lies, even though he couldn't tell a single lie due to a curse from the goddess of magic. Cyric said this made him perfect, because the best lie is the most unbelievable truth, once again showing Cyric is a Xanatos master. Oh, and he also gained the loyalty of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> during the course of all this and tends to threaten his enemies with the thing occasionally.
<ul><li> More like losing and calling it winning. Bane's the real master. He, Bhaal, and Myrkul all had backup plans in the event of the failure of their gambits during the Time of Troubles. Bane didn't bother with mortal progeny (Bhaal) or depositing his essence in an artifact (Myrkul) — he created a demigod child to inherit his mantle. Even said child didn't know he was a glorified chrysalis — when he grew sufficiently powerful, Bane erupted from within him like a horrible, horrible butterfly. The Lord of Darkness was back in business, baby!
</li></ul></li><li> The galaxy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> is the chessboard for a four-way free-for-all game of Xanatos Speed Chess between Tzeentch, the Deceiver, the Eldar farseers, and the Emperor, with a few others dabbling on the side. All players involved are very, very good at it.
<ul><li> It's probably worthwhile to note that, at the same time as all those groups work against each other, Tzeentch is also playing more games of four-way Speed Chess with different rules against the other Chaos Gods. Interestingly, he is the only player in any of these four way games who <em>cannot</em> win, because winning means he would have no one else to play against, and that's <em>suicidal</em> when you're the literal embodiment of scheming. Initially, this would seem like a bit of an impasse: He cannot stop scheming, but his schemes would lead to him winning, which would kill him... Tzeentch's solution? <em>More</em> Speed Chess games against <em>himself</em>, constantly foiling his <em>own</em> plans so that he will never attain victory. To spell out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a> - the <strong>Chaos</strong> God of scheming and change is the greatest enforcer of the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo</a></strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> Anybody who has ever played the group strategy game Mafia/Werewolf as a bad guy has had to attempt this. A detailed original plan NEVER goes off without problems.
</li><li> Pretty much all Cheapass Games work this way, with other players (and pure randomness) changing conditions so fast that any strategy has to adapt just as fast. Looney Labs games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fluxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fluxx">Fluxx</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts">Chrononauts</a></em>) are similar.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a>, of course. Under a time control of 1 minute for the entire game, the only way to make your moves quickly enough is to choose a move because it is the most active move that stops the opponents threats.
</li><li> Any and every CCG or competitive boardgame ever. There's always that one person who whips out with "WTF" strategies that can and will throw the group off guard.
</li><li> The strategy game Hellgame runs on this trope. Not only do each player control three characters, positioned in different places in the turn order (so a player can be both the first and the last to act in a single turn), this turn order can be manipulated by the playing of cards. Random events abound; every turn begins with a random event (which can in turn cause other random events to occur, or put down triggers which cause them to happen later, often several times), and a typical spell causes random events to happen to other players (or yourself). Combat is resolved by die rolls, often modified by spell cards and said random events. A player can seem to be unstoppable, only for a completely harmless-looking opponent to suddenly jump to the end of the turn order to cut of the expected victory and grab it for himself, only for _another_ player to do the same, and then some. A game can last a single turn, or ten; which is in no way an indication of the elapsed time of the game. Successfully wading through this sea of random happenstances and quirky rules, battling the other players (five of them) for supremacy over the turn order is the path to victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> sets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">PCs</a> up with mutually conflicting goals, then throws rapid-fire obstacles at them along the way. One suggested game mechanic is to ask each PC "What are you doing?", then only give them about five seconds to answer:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Friend Gamemaster:</strong> Okay, you've just been dropped off in Outdoors Sector. Suddenly, some people appear at the top of a hill, charging down toward you with long pointy sticks. *to PC #1* What are you doing? <br/><strong>PC #1:</strong> Uh, what do these people look like? <br/><strong>Friend Gamemaster:</strong> Dirty smelly Infrareds with ragged uniforms. One of them sticks his long pointy stick into your chest. *to PC #2* What are <em>you</em> doing? <br/><strong>PC #2:</strong> *realizing that PC #1 just dropped the team's camera* I shove PC #3 toward them. <br/><strong>PC #3:</strong> Hey!
</div></li><li> Most (but by no means all) theater-style American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LARP">live-action roleplaying games</a> are designed to be Xanatos Speed Chess tournaments.
</li><li> Online freeform roleplaying combat at a high level is this; prima makes their attack, secunda makes a response that is nigh-unavoidable, prima has to respond and try and take back momentum, and so on back-and-forth until someone runs out of moves to make. It's fun!
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em> card game has some of this, too, especially in epic games with high levels and four or more players. Given that the official time limit for interfering in seemingly successful Combat rounds is "a reasonable amount of time (defined as 2.6 seconds)," things can get a bit... hectic, when players are trying to aid/hinder another player's efforts, <em>especially</em> the final level(s).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> is powered by this trope, especially in tournament play. Control mirrors are dozens of turns of this, with each player pretending they had it planned all along.
<ul><li> Actually averted the better one gets at the game- there's a limit to how much strategies can be modified without bending one's deck and game out of shape. Good play is more like using this trope to back up a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>.
</li><li> This is the only way to play the card game <em>Fluxx</em>, because the rules of play and victory conditions are constantly changing.
</li></ul></li><li> Classes with the Leader role from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 4th Edition lend themselves to this style of play, especially Warlords. Generally, they employ subtle long-term buffs that shape their team's playstyle combined with dramatic short-term buffs that let them compensate for surprises that upset their planning. Given the right player and a good DM, battles can be fascinating affairs.
<ul><li> In 5th edition, rogues gain the ability to engage in a variety of normally full-action maneuvers using a bonus action each round, while other classes can almost never use their bonus action for anything other than slightly enhancing their main or move action. In the hands of even a moderately savvy player this makes the rogue the speed-chess champion, able to switch targets, change formation, and (with the appropriate specialization) even alter the playing field at the drop of a hat once the original tactics fall through.

<ul><li> The Omar's strategy comes across as this, especially from the point of view of their ending. Their fair and helpful dealing with the player through the entire game? Laying the groundwork to put them in the right place at the right time. The recruitment of (and eventual modification of) Leo? Setting up a pawn close enough to the player to influence their decision at the proper time. Leo refusing the final upgrade? With as much modification has already been completed, how can he (or you) truly know for sure whether or not he still retains any free-will at all? By seemingly rejecting their offer and asking for your help, Leo becomes the ONLY character in the entire game who is seemingly both free of outside influence as well as complicated plots or goals of his own - putting him in a perfect position to offer advice without the player looking for an ulterior motive (thus making him the perfect way for the Omar to influence the player without their knowledge). <br/><br/>Note that's it's LEO'S advice at the crucial moment that convinces you to kill every faction (thus killing off every hope of stablizing society and eliminating the only real threats to eventual Omar hegemony). By following the advice of the man who is quite possibly an Omar puppet, you guarantee Omar victory. It might sound like too far-fetched and overly complex a gambit to even remotely be true - until you remember you're basically playing a game which is almost entirely built around the idea that most conspiracy theories are real, the fate of the entire world is regularly decided by insanely complex plots, and that the more insane a plot seems, the more likely it is to have been true the entire time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Billie and Klara were deliberately recruited by other factions, and both were used in attempts to influence Alex's actions.

<ul><li> In the first game, SHODAN's plan amounts to this (backup plans listed after initial plans):
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Destroy life on Earth using the space station's mining laser, so she can remake life in her image. The player responds by destroying the laser.</span>

He essentially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">went back in time and convinced his younger self to do it</a></em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's DiZ <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AKA Ansem the Wise</span>, who might be, perhaps, just as good - he was, after all, taking on the Organization, headed by Xemnas, and he was winning. In fact, at least at the end of Chain of Memories (and, one could argue, even the end of Days), everything was going pretty much according to plan. In the end, the only thing that toppled him was his own arrogance causing him to bite off more than he could chew (something which he admits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the King, just before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, as well as in the Secret Reports</span>) and the fact that, consequently, his game became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a>. Like Xehanort and Xemnas, he lost track of all the players - Sora isn't anywhere close to being a Speed Chesser, but he's rather effective as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a>, and Riku's just as bad, since DiZ isn't as able to predict his actions as he'd like to think he is.

His original plan is simply to experiment on Imoen and the player character in his own personal lair. However, this runs into trouble when Shadow Thieves attack him, his prisoners escape and, on top of all of this which he could have handled simply by virtue of his great power, the local wizard authorities get wind of the unsanctioned use of magic and teleport in to arrest him. Killing hundreds of them is not the path of least resistance even for him, so he suddenly decides to go peacefully, but making sure they also arrest Imoen. They are both taken to a wizard asylum, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which Irenicus soon takes over, continuing his experiments with Imoen and waiting for the player character to come after him.</span> The player character already has two potential motives for doing this - wanting revenge on Irenicus and to rescue their "little sister" - but a third one is added when Irenicus somehow appears in their dreams and speaks of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unlocking their potential as a descendant of a god, speaking as if the player character could gain great power though he really has no interest in giving it to them but rather just stealing it away. Unless that's just the Bhaal in you talking and not Irenicus at all.</span> (This is also, in a way, the game masking its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a> plot element. You <em>have</em> to go after Irenicus and Imoen, but at least you get to pick your motivation out of a fair selection.) The player may make various choices along the way and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">choose to ally or not with two characters who are actually Irenicus's pawns, but the end result is the same - in a non-contrived way - and they end up just where Irenicus wants them.</span>

She then recruits Raynor and Fenix to rescue the Dominion emperor Mengsk from the UED, uses the three of them to destroy one of the UED's main bases of operations, then backstabs them and kills Fenix and Mengsk's general leaving the two demoralized and de-powered. She then kidnaps the Protoss Raszagal and uses her to blackmail her co-commander Zeratul into giving her access to special assassins that will kill the Zerg hivemind and leave her in complete control of them.

</li><li> The Reapers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> aren't bad at this. Their original plan (which has worked for millions of years), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is to let civilizations grow using the Citadel and mass relays. They then use these to harvest every space faring civilization.</span> Here are the adjustments they've had to make:
<ul><li> Ancient race, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Protheans</span>, disabled a system in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Citadel</span> integral to their plans so they indoctrinated the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rachni</span> and started a war, hoping to capture the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Citadel</span> and manually activate it.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Krogan</span> wiped out said species? Try again with the Geth.
</li><li> Shepard defeated Sovereign and put the kibosh on that plan? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kill him/her, try and recover the corpse, then build a human Reaper to take Sovereign's place.</span>
</li><li> Shepard came <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a></span>, killed your servants, and destroyed the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">human reaper</span>, Sovereigns future replacement? Fine, get everyone to the Alpha Relay. Oh, and use indoctrinated servants to capture Shepard, so you can turn him/her to your side.
</li><li> Shepard escaped capture and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">took out the Relay</span>? No matter, that only delays the invasion a few months anyway.
</li><li> Once in the galaxy, brutally attack Earth and Khar'Shan immediately and hopefully take out Shepard. Even if Shepard survives, humanity gets crippled right at the start. All your other preparations can proceed as planned either way.
</li><li> Presumably, their adjustments to the plan are so ideal that by their arrival proper - assuming Shepard doesn't stop them - people expect the Reaper invasion to finish quicker than the last time it happened, where things did go according to plan. All the past wars they created had left the galaxy divided and much easier to defeat than in the previous cycle.

<div class="indent">"They planned their campaigns just as you might make a splendid piece of harness. It looks very well, and answers very well, until it gets broken, and then you are done for. Now I made my campaigns of ropes. If anything went wrong, I tied a knot and went on."

<div class="indent">"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ErwinRommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, General in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">Wehrmacht</a> and the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, built his entire career and reputation on this. If he was ordered to take an objective he wouldn't just launch an attack and take it. He'd launch an attack and take it, then plan another attack to exploit any weaknesses he'd created, then plan <em>another</em> attack to exploit any <em>more</em> weaknesses he'd created, and keep on inventing new attack plans on the fly until the other side surrendered or his side quite <em>literally</em> ran out of gas.
<ul><li> Rommel was not alone in this, as it was an integral part of Blitzkrieg as devised by Guderian and the German doctrine emphasized including subordinates into the plan so they could improvise on the spot or take over should you fall. This was a large part of German success on the tactical level. Of course there were Speed Chess players amongst other armies as well, but to the Germans it was an integrated part of their doctrine.
<ul><li> Most professional modern militaries use it these days: the standard format for issuing orders includes the larger context, <em>why</em> the orders are being issued and what the goal is. This allows junior officers (and troops) to be aware of the ultimate objective so that they can respond on the fly to changing conditions.
</li></ul></li><li> Rommel's American counterpart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton">George Patton</a>, was no slouch either. He stood out among the Allies' generals for his strategic prowess, so much that in the leadup to Operation Overlord he was put in charge of the decoy First Army in because Allied high command wanted the Germans to think it was the real deal. In fact, Harry Yeide's book <em>Fighting Patton</em> reveals that the Germans mostly didn't know or care who Patton was, but fortunately they still fell for the misdirection. Patton's crowning achievement was during the Battle of the Bulge, where he moved to relieve the besieged 101st Airborne Division defending the city of Bastogne, a vital hub in the war effort that the loss of which would bring the entire Allied offensive to a screeching halt. <em>At the same time,</em> he was <em>already</em> engaged with several German infantry and armored divisions to the south of Bastogne, and had to make sure that, even as he moved to relieve the 101st, the Germans would still remain effectively stalled so they would not realize he was pulling back, and along with <em>all</em> of this, he was dealing with Allied supply lines stretched thin, with his tanks literally outrunning the fuel trucks supplying them, and with that he had <em>100 miles</em> of what could loosely be termed as "roads" between him and the 101st, and doing all of this in the coldest part of the European winter. He dealt with all of this, and more, attacking the Germans at their flanks in Bastogne and breaking the seige, and preserving the Allied lines. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> indeed.

</li><li> It's unclear whether President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Anwar Sadat</a> of Egypt planned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">October War</a> of 1973 (known as the Yom Kippur War in Israel and many other places) as one of these, or if his actions afterward were just a very successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a>, but either way, it turned out like this. The main Egyptian goal in '73 was recapturing the Sinai Peninsula (and, if possible, to destroy Israel), so Egypt launched an invasion across the Suez Canal on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishHolidays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishHolidays">Yom Kippur</a>, the one day when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles">Israelis with Infrared Missiles</a> would be praying, fasting, and at services (Yom Kippur is the most significant Jewish 'holiday' as a day of repentance, remembrance, and introspection). This allowed Egyptian forces to retake a substantial proportion of the Sinai (until bad generalship screwed things up and allowed the IDF to push them back out), but the first few days were just enough of a victory that Sadat could claim just enough political capital to allow him to start peace negotiations with Israel...and get back the Sinai (if Israel and Egypt are at peace, Israel doesn't need the Sinai as a buffer). Whether he knew this all along or just took advantage of opportunities as they came up is unclear, but either way, it really was a win-win (until Sadat got an assassin's bullet to the head for his trouble...oh, well).
<ul><li> You might argue that he could have just asked for peace. That would be wrong. It's questionable whether the Israelis would have accepted a peace deal had he offered it — despite official policy statements, some members of the Cabinet (e.g. Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, who famously said "Israel has no foreign policy — only defense policy") might not have been so willing to take the deal. Even assuming that the Israelis' rhetoric matched their intentions, there's the matter of whether the <em>Egyptians</em> would have accepted a deal; the 1967 War was a humiliating defeat, and it would be difficult to sell a peace agreement to his people and even to the other generals who ran the government — it would be regarded as giving in to Israel's holding Sinai hostage. Starting a war with Israel in which Egypt won substantial military victories early on was necessary to show that Egypt and Israel were on an equal footing militarily, allowing any deal with Israel to be an agreement of equals rather than blackmail. Once the war started and the early victories assured, however, the path to securing Sinai was assured — either by military conquest (with the final peace treaty saleable because Egypt would be the victor) or by negotiation (as part of a negotiated settlement after an armistice seen as honorable because both sides had bloodied each other enough to show rough parity).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> general, George B. McClellan subverted this. He believed that victory went to the commander who outsmarted his enemy. McClellan was always trying to decide what old Lee would have done and then come up with a really elaborate counterstrike that would wreck his plans. But his methods led to a loss as to what the <em>objective</em> was, leading him to pass up opportunities where all that was needed was a direct attack following a plan no more complicated than "keep shooting until the other side is all dead".
<ul><li> William T. Sherman's march through Atlanta was an example of this. His adversary, Joseph Johnston, was the finest defensive general that the Confederacy could field. Rather than attacking him outright, Sherman adopted maneuver tactics. Johnston would set up a defense, and Sherman would go around him. The one major assault Sherman launched, the Union was driven back. In the end, he won the game — the Confederate government got fed up, replaced Johnston with John Bell Hood, a "fighting" general...and Sherman whipped him quite soundly.
</li></ul></li><li> The best players in team-based sports demonstrate this ability, specifically, team-based sports that have a main method of play be passing the ball from player-to-player. To use skilled quarterbacks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a> as an example: first, every throwing play is designed to give the quarterback multiple players to throw the ball to. The QB is expected to go quickly through his progressions to see who is open. Second, many quarterbacks will try to read defenses before the ball is snapped, and if they think the play they are about to run will be ineffective, will audible to a different play. Third, some particularly mobile quarterbacks will decide to run with the ball. Sometimes this is a last-ditch effort when nobody is open, but other times it is the core concept of an offense, since the threat of such runs can force defenses to devote defenders away from potential receivers in future plays. Fourth, quarterbacks will use body language, particularly where they're looking, to get defenders to move away from their actual intended play and open up opportunities elsewhere. And fifth, the <em>really</em> good quarterbacks will use ball placement and chemistry with their receivers to change the play <em>mid-throw</em>, something generally referred to as "throwing your receiver open".
