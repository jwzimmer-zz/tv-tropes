It is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">conveniently specific</a>. A taste of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, a particularly shocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia">traumatic event</a>, or even a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">Tap on the Head</a> will be sufficient to make your character forget all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">who</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">what</a> they are.
</p><p>In most cases, the character has simply lost their memories, no longer remembering their name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacLover">loved ones</a> or where they came from. This is often the cause for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForIdentity">Quest for Identity</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, however, it is their <em>personality</em> that has changed. Not only do they not remember who they were, they are convinced that they are someone else entirely. In essence, Bob doesn't just forget that he's Bob, but he thinks he's Alice instead...
</p><p>The affected character may have additional amnesia on top of their personality change, but it's not a guarantee. It's possible they may still know everything they did prior to the switch, except that they've never before <em>acted</em> the way they're acting now. Attempts to get them to remember previous life-defining events that may snap them out of it are likely to be met with a stern dismissal: "Why do you keep talking about this "Bob" guy?! I haven't time for this! I'm a world-famous opera singer and must be on stage in one hour!"
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Just like other forms of TV amnesia, this variety is often rectified by just smacking the character in the head a second time; they are usually very resistant to seeking out help on their own. As far as they're concerned, nothing is wrong.
</p><p>Once restored, they'll probably have no recollection of their amnesia-induced alter ego, and will probably be puzzled as to why time has moved forward by several hours/days.
</p><p>Once their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</a> nature has been demonstrated, it's a foregone conclusion that should the character in question get tapped on the head at a later date, the alternate persona will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTakeover">right back in the saddle again.</a>
</p><p>A vast exaggeration of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> mental disorder, known as a "Fugue State". This is when someone believes themselves to be someone completely different. They may move to a different town and assume a different identity, without being aware the new identity is false. It is a very, very rare result of a psychotic break. Dissociative amnesia can also parallel this trope, but also under very rare and extreme circumstances.

You still remember who you are, but have no memory of having done certain things. You're just as likely (or more) to disown good deeds as bad ones.

Juan. He was not, the real priest was killed in the countryside and Coraje could not save him, and replaced him instead to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> in the village. The problem was when he was shot and forgot everything. The people told him that he was the priest (because that was what they thought), and he believed that. The whereabouts of Coraje were unknown for everyone: he must have died, or left, or gave up, or whatever. And one day, after a conflict with the mayor, a union leader told him:
<div class="indent"><strong>Man:</strong> The people need a leader, a hero. They need Coraje. <br/><strong>Juan:</strong> But Coraje is gone. Nobody knows what has happened to him, or heard about him in months. <br/><strong>Man:</strong> That is not important. The people do not know who is behind the cloak. If Coraje is gone, he won't mind for someone else to put on a similar cloak and be the new Coraje. <br/>And so, the priest became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>... of himself.

But he forgets about and ignores poor Daisy, who eventually goes to a psychologist and explains the whole thing in flashback.

He's hiding out in a flock of penguins and gets knocked out.

Another bump on the head later fixes this.

Popeye, Olive, Wimpy and Swee'Pea are enjoying a day in each's company, and while Popeye is playing "bullfight" with Swee'Pea, he conks his head and in the process conks Swee'Pea in the head. The two suddenly exchange personalities and voices with each other.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode has Squidward getting hit on the head (causing it to swell really big) and thinking he's a baby, who SpongeBob and Patrick need to take care of.

</li><li> The episode "Mimic Madness" features SpongeBob doing imitations of everyone in Bikini Bottom so much that he develops "Mocking Mimicry Madness" and forgets who he really is.
</li><li> This happens in an earlier episode where, while going along with Squidward's charade of owning a restaurant, SpongeBob forgets his name. Because he can't remember his name, he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>, making the whole charade collapse.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, this trope is the basis of a story arc stretching from the last minutes of Season 1 to the first 3 episodes of Season 2. Optimus loses his memories when he depleted the Matrix of Leadership's energy upon Unicron and forgets his entire life as when he was Optimus, only remembering of when he was Orion Pax and <em>before</em> he became enemies with Megatron. Megatron takes advantage of the amnesia by making Optimus do computer-coding work for the Decepticons.

To all appearances, a classic psychotic break, caused by an emotionally trying year including her mother's death and her husband's infidelity.
<ul><li> There's considerable evidence that Mrs. Christie planned and executed the entire affair quite consciously in order to embarrass her husband. No one, of course, can know for certain, but the setup strongly resembled those in her books. To top things off, she registered at the Swan Hotel <em>using the surname of her husband's paramour</em>.
