</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Hitman: Absolution</a></em> has two. In "Rosewood", you can rescue a man being tortured by a pair of Wade's men, and in the "Attack of the Saints" mission, where you can save the hotel manager from being executed by the search team, and have him profusely thank you in response.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower">Pandora's Tower</a></em> has Elena. You can keep her company, chat with her, give her gifts, and in exchange she will make medicine and translate the documents you find, even if you do nothing of the above. Also, even though beating a boss resets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkedByTheBell">progress of her curse</a>, you really <strong>don't</strong> want to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">what happens to her</a> if you let the meter drop below red because you really <em>had</em> to finish the dungeon in one run. Even though you can easily heal her back, the moment is still heart-wrenching.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">ADOM</a></em>: You get this message even if your character is a bloodthirsty trollish berserker or dark elf necromancer:
<div class="indent">The cute dog attacks the ogre. The cute dog misses the ogre. The ogre attacks the cute dog. The cute dog is killed! You are direly saddened about the death of the cute dog.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> is similar to <em>ADOM</em> with: "The spell hits the &lt;monster&gt;!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ABoyAndHisBlob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ABoyAndHisBlob">A Boy and His Blob</a></em> for the Wii features a <em>Hug</em> button just for this purpose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a></em> is particularly mean with this. Each and every one of your 200+ soldiers is individually named, with their ranks and kills, and any soldier surviving a mission will be promoted; those who don't survive are recalled by name at the end of each level, and possibly added to the honours board. The first four - <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/cannon-fodder/screenshots/gameShotId,93639/">Jools, Jops, Stoo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and RJ - are beloved by game players everywhere; they're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> to the main game developers. And you <em>will</em> give everything to try and keep them alive, because that Lost In Service list scrolling up between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePoppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePoppy">poppies</a> is devastating. The game satirises pretty much every single last one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAndWarfareTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAndWarfareTropes">Military and Warfare Tropes</a>. Oh, and all the characters are about nine pixels high.
<ul><li> Not to mention that the screen between missions is a war cemetery featuring a little grave stone for each man you have lost. In the foreground a long, winding line of men queue up for the chance to give their lives for your cause. The more casualties you take, the more men need to be admitted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has an NPC named Curly who sacrifices her life to save yours. But if you do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">exactly the right things</a>, you can save her</span>. Incidentally, this is the only way to access a bonus level and the best ending.
</li><li> The semi-sentient AI population, Darwinians, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntroversionSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntroversionSoftware">Introversion Software</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia">Darwinia</a></em>. Though, if you move fast enough you can 'revive' them endlessly, unless they get annihilated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Soul Destroyer</a>, in which case they leave saddening ghostly echoes of their bodies behind. And then there's the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Biosphere</span> level, where most of the methods of winning involve sending wave upon wave of the cute little guys <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">against their virus-corrupted kin</span>. Made worse because the Darwinians are voiced by one of the developers' pet cat and meow very sweetly as they die.
</li><li> A cute game is trying to keep the AI-controlled player second player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">And punishing them for their stupidity when they don't get out of the way</a>. This is actually somewhat useful, as having two players means double the powerups.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> the game. You <em>can</em> get away with blasting a few innocent citizens, but every single person has a name that you somehow know. It's not so fun seeing Eduardo Mellini bleeding out in the middle of Fifth and Ten. Occasionally they will also shout things like "Don't do this! I have a wife and kids!"
<ul><li> Made worse by their lack of survival instincts! GET OUT OF THE WAY, SAL! THERE'S A HIGH SPEED CHASE TAKING PLACE HERE!
</li><li> Also, the security guards at banks. They're not even mob affiliated, they're just doing their jobs! For the small banks, you can get away with robbing it and not killing any of them. Doesn't work for the big banks....
</li><li> There's also your Corleone allies who always help you out whenever they see you in trouble, and the guys you hire to help take down enemy strongholds. It's rather sad to see them get killed in action on your behalf.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>. The nameless Grove Street mooks you pick up to assist in missions will chatter with C.J. on the way to the goal, giving him shit like all his named friends. Makes it hard to watch them mowed down like wheat. Of course it doesn't help they tend to fire wildly at every cop that comes by.
<ul><li> An even better example is <a class="urllink" href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/06/05/my-four-year-old-son-plays-grand-theft-auto/">this story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a four-year-old whose father let him play San Andreas, only to discover that the innocent kid used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> potential to arrest criminals, help firefighters, and drive the wounded to the hospital in an ambulance, refusing to steal any cars or drive recklessly because that would be wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico">ICO</a></em> is all about this. You spend the entire game worrying about how Yorda is doing. Her ability to open doors certainly helps as well.
<ul><li> The first time Ico calls her across a gap she can't possibly leap, and she jumps <em>anyway</em>, trusting Ico to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMyHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeMyHand">catch her and pull her up</a>.
<ul><li> Although still images don't do it justice, you can get a good idea of the heart-in-throat moments from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rose-tainted.net/ico/essays/17.jpg">this picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> Heck, Ico calling for Yorda and leading her by the hand through hordes of Dark Spirits. Or Ico fighting his way <em>through</em> those hordes to pull her out of their grasp with all the ferocity a twelve-year-old boy can muster.
<ul><li> All of this is made even more interesting because Yorda speaks an unknown language; Ico (and the player) haven't a clue what she's saying, and they have to communicate via body language. That she's so darned important to you when you can't even understand her is impressive, to say the least.
</li></ul></li><li> It's safe to say that the developers pulled this off well enough that there's plenty of people with fond memories of the game despite most of it being one giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>, which are normally the bane of many a gamer.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, the main inspiration for <em>Ico</em> was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em>, which has a similar caring relationship with a mute alien who looks exactly the same as your average mook.

The player can choose to not show Anju the pendent, and then help Kafei get back his Sun Mask. By doing so, Anju will not be waiting in the inn when Kafei arrives at the inn, as she had fled to Romani Ranch, causing Kafei to look at Anju's wedding dress and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">laments that he could not keep his promise to Anju</a>. It's also possible to convince her to stay but then not help Kafei get the mask back, dooming her to spend her last moments, believing he'll come for her.

Turns out the 'Ghosts' that abduct the cows on the night of the first day did... something... to her. Cremia's horror at what has happened only increases the desire to help Romani.

</li><li> One of the sweetest aspects of the game is helping someone who's fighting with monsters.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> allows the player, in their role as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">benevolent goddess</a>, to perform good deeds ranging from making trees and flowers bloom to finding water for reservoirs to battling demons.

<ul><li> If you use the Bloom power on friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, they cheer up and pet you.
</li><li> Feeding the animals gives you a little cutscene of them eating. Afterward they'll have little hearts floating around when they see you.
<ul><li> In fact, Okami <em>breathes</em> this trope. As a benevolent goddess, you earn Praise (for leveling up) not just by heroic deeds and beating the bad guys, but by feeding those animals, making trees bloom, turning dead land into fertile ground, and taking other totally non-violent actions to simply improve people's lives. It restores life <em>and</em> a sense of wonder to the world, enhancing your divine strength.

(actually, they all can, but while the other variants just get generic graphical upgrades that reflect how good their equipment is, you can actually SEE what the Browns are carrying). Since certain pieces of equipment are unique, gained from defeating specific bosses or one-time-only encounters - or just plain rare - you can easily end up wanting to protect the one who's wearing a golden crown and wielding a giant fondue fork, partially because they're unique and powerful items (which will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost for good</a> if he dies) and partially because they serve as souvenirs of an interesting boss-fight.
<ul><li> Of course, some of them can also become valued simply for comedic value, such as the one wearing a tophat and wielding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerfArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerfArm">bouquet of flowers</a>, or the one wearing a full beard (the previous owner didn't need it anymore).
</li><li> The sequel encourages players to keep their minions alive more, since the Minions now have names, personalities, manageable equipment, mounts, levels, and the ability to raise favorites from the dead at a graveyard. However as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> you're mainly motivated by the fact that you don't want powerful Minions carrying special equipment such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFSes</a>, Gladiator Helmets or one-of-a-kind hats to go to waste.
<ul><li> Course in the sequel if you really care about your favourite Minion you can bring him back to life. At a cost, to save a level 10 Minion for example will require you to kill 20 in trade.

<ul><li> Losing Pikmin can cause players to feel bad. Something about their screams is upsetting, and then there are those water vapour ghosts to remind you how badly you let them all down. It's even worse if you just leave some behind after dark. Not to mention they're basically dying for capitalism in the second game.
</li><li> <em>Pikmin don't have graves, you know.</em>

</li><li> Also, in the first game, Olimar himself, as an extension of the player, becomes attached to the little critters, as evidenced in his log entries.

If you pick it up and carry it off, it says "Thank you" in that strangely endearing robotic voice. You even get an achievement for saving it.
</li><li> Generally, the turrets talk to the player in a very endearing way. "Please put me down,", "Where are you?" and "Good night," are all great examples of this.

As long as you don't go too far ahead, it's pretty easy, you get a few arrowheads, and you feel like you've just started on your way to become a hero. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Then he explodes.</a> (Well, his mental personification explodes.

Heartbreaking when after riding across a collapsing bridge, Agro throws you safely to the other side before falling to her death...only for you to find out during the credits that she is still alive, but with a broken leg.</span>
<ul><li> Sadistically, the game manages to make you care about practically every other Colossus you kill.

Some of the mooks that will fight by your side get unique conversations with Tony; a nice bit of character development. Of course, the fact that they kick so many kinds of ass will also inspire the desire to keep them alive. See how many missions you can do with the same minion!
<ul><li> In addition, Tony Montana himself invokes this trope: If you try to fire on civilians unprovoked, he simply refuses to respond to the players press of the trigger button, muttering to himself things like "Naw, I ain't gonna do that, mang."

The joy a player gets when their Chao evolve from a baby to their next form is hard to reproduce. The mini-game can also be a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">cruelty potential</a>, if you're really feeling sadistic.
</li><li> The AI partners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</a> 2</em> aren't good for much aside from distracting enemy aces. However, it feels good to help out your partners and hear them express their gratitude. Mission Mode encourages you to do this, as having friendly relations with other pilots can unlock bonus missions, and there's even a set of missions specifically for improving relations with them. Conversely, when you're on opposite sides with the character you like, they'll express horror and rage when they see you're their enemy now and thoroughly guilt-trip you. To top it off, Kamille's path in Mission Mode allows you to reverse the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Z Gundam</a></em> by saving Henken, the Radish, and Emma.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> uses this to build up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">Player Punch</a>, by having you spend the first hour interacting with Ezio's family. This includes defending his sister's honor against a philandering boyfriend, doing favors for his sick little brother and his mother, and in general getting across the message that the Auditore are a very close and caring family. Later on there's a Quick Time Event that allows you to hug Leonardo da Vinci, who at this point is Ezio's best friend. Players have been known to go back and reload a previous save if they miss the prompt for the hug the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</a></em> allows the player to build up a crew of assassins that you recruit from the oppressed citizenry. You can outfit them with kit and send them out on missions. Also, destroying the Borgia oppression leads to the revitalization of Rome, and eventually <em>The Renaissance.</em>
<ul><li> As you progress through the game, the background chatter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> will include statements like "things are really getting better" and "there will be a special throne in Hell for Cesare Borgia when this is all over."

If they get hurt, you can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">heal them, by sacrificing your own health</span>.

You play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Chuck Greene</a> whose daughter, Katey was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieInfectee">bitten by a zombie</a>, to prevent her transformation into one of the walking dead, she requires a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours. Seeing how this is...well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Dead Rising</a>, it's another thing you have to neatly fit into your schedule. You have to find Zombrex while finding the truth, then also administer a shot to save her. It's really easy to start caring for little Katey, you can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideTrackedByTheGoldSaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideTrackedByTheGoldSaucer">bring her gifts</a> for experience points and achievements! However, you CAN ignore this fact and let her die, since this is...well, <em>Dead Rising</em>, but it condemns you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Ending F</a>, which ends on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">absolutely tragic</a> note, not only that, but you'll feel like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">complete bastard.</a>
</li><li> You can't save most of the guards slaughtered by the Joker and his goons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>, but everyone you <em>do</em> save thanks you profusely, and the other surviving guards express their gratitude for you just being there. You even get an achievement on one level for saving all the guards and an escaped prisoner.
<ul><li> This is made somewhat worse, however, when you return to the same areas and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find the bodies of those same guards.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Among the inmates of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em> are any number of innocent political prisoners. You'll hear them long before you see them, screaming and pleading for help as they're assaulted by criminals. And while you don't <em>have</em> to stop what you're doing and save them, it's very satisfying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">dive in</a>, kick their tormentors to the curb, and hear them thank you like only someone trapped in a war zone can.
</li><li> The last chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMonkeyIsland">Tales of Monkey Island</a></em> ends in a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> on the happy-go-lucky main character, Guybrush Threepwood. It looks extremely painful and brutal but it's made even worse when you can hear the pain in Guybrush's voice every time he talks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Being a zombie at the time, he can't even die to escape the pain.</span> The idea was that as he's getting thrown all over, you're suppose to come up with a way to get him out of it. In the commentary, the creators said a lot of people had trouble playing because they felt so terrible for Guybrush.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> actually gives you the chance to spare several targets that you've been assigned to kill. Some of them even show up with little sidequests you can follow if you proceed to do so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> has several moments of these: often you'll randomly encounter people in trouble, such as being held hostage, having their valuables stolen, or even trapped in a car wreck. You can ignore 'em, make things worse, or even go out of your way to help them out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> has this in spades. There's several chances for you to help out the random bystanders, from saving a woman who's about to be stabbed to death, preventing innocent people from being shot down, or even helping a guy recover his stolen horse. Not only that, but you're even given the means of acting in self-defense through lethal <em>or</em> non-lethal means thanks to your lasso, which means if you work for it you can really build yourself up as a man of honor. It certainly feels rewarding when your fame goes up enough so that random citizens you pass by actually start saying "hi" or even praising you for your efforts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And that actually makes it all the more tragic when your character gets killed at the end and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> behind it gets you remembered as a monster.</span>
</li><li> Occasionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em>, you'll come across helpless survivors that are stranded in the dunes without wheels (which, given the world of Mad Max, means they're as good as dead). While you can't give them a ride to the nearest settlement, you can give them some of your precious water. While it's not completely selfless, as it's mainly done to get information, considering Max's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">usual attitude towards his fellow man</a>, it's still pretty nice of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000Spacemarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000Spacemarine">Space Marine</a></em> has this through raw storytelling; there is neither in-game reward nor punishment for allowing the Imperial Guard units to be slaughtered by rampaging Orks or daemons, short of having that much less fire support as you carve a bloody swathe through that portion of the green tide. You do, however, start to feel for the plucky little guys, not just for the fact that they look upon you in awe like literal angels from heaven come to save them (with bits of NPC chatter making some seem like their lives are now complete and would be satisfied if they died fighting alongside you), but from the way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">genetically enhanced, gigantic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> main characters praise them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">holding out a last line of defense against seemingly insurmountable odds</a>. You <em>will</em> end up rushing headlong into those xenos scum, just to make sure that many more brave Guardsmen don't get crumped while you hang back and shoot at things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em>, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">exactly what the name suggests</a>, contains a lot of ways to creatively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a>, or just ruin their lives. However, there are two methods that don't require hurting the rivals- Befriending (in which you help a rival out with major life problems, and they're so grateful they give up on being a rival) and Matchmaking (in which you set them up with other students with crushes on them).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderUnderworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a></em> added tranquilizer guns to Lara Croft's arsenal, giving players the option to take out some enemies non-lethally. This is no doubt an attempt to salvage Lara's reputation as a coldblooded killer who guns down endangered tigers with no remorse.
</li><li> A new gameplay feature that was added in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs2">Watch_Dogs 2</a></em> took the ATM hacking this way. The original purpose as used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Aiden</a> was to siphon money from bank accounts without people knowing. Marcus, however, has the option to do the opposite, <em>giving</em> money to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> he sees in the city. And just like the original, there's no repercussion or acknowledgement for doing so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlossomTalesTheSleepingKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlossomTalesTheSleepingKing">Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King</a></em>, being a kind, helpful person is actually a game mechanic, as a large number of your powerups come from completing sidequests for NPCs. You dont <em>have</em> to do the vast majority of them, but it makes the game much easier.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> games usually have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a> alongside the player's plane. While it's possible to go ahead and focus on destroying the targets while leaving the other planes to go down, there's some satisfaction to be gained in helping allies to fend off enemy planes and gain air superiority. <em>Fires of Liberation</em> explicates this by rewarding the player for helping out in secondary operations, such as by letting them call down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacres</a>.

If you don't feel sad about PJ in <em>Belkan War</em>, you have emotional capacity of a tree stump, but on the other hand, can you really get yourself mad enough at Pixy, after all you've been through together, can you? And how about Edge, Grimm, and Chopper in <em>AC5</em>—don't you feel really close to them, despite not really knowing anything about them except their names and appearances?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</em>, you play a Naboo pilot leading a resistance movement against the Trade Federation occupying the planet. At various points, farmers are being slaughtered and their homes razed by droids. It's hard not to veer away from the main objective to quickly dispatch the metal bastards, especially as you listen to the terrified screams and desperate pleas over the comm channel.
<ul><li> Likewise, when you free prisoners from internment camps and lead them to safety. Only one or two of the vehicles have to make it, but it feels terrible knowing that they've suffered in those camps for weeks, only to die just when freedom was within sight. Unfortunately, it's damn near impossible to keep all of them alive.
</li></ul></li><li> The ancient PC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GPolice">G-Police</a></em> inspired a feeling of protectiveness over the nearly helpless ground units that filled the missions. The player character's fellow law enforcement officers that are on the ground need your air support, or they aren't going to last. The small, weak but relentlessly persistent vehicles engender a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> feeling.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a>'s</em> Little Sisters sit on the thin line between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>.

<ul><li> A sequence in the end turns it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you become personally responsible for protecting a little sister who's been made into a normal girl. Usually the Little Sisters are invulnerable, but not anymore... meaning that she has no survival instinct. But she trusts her daddy to keep her safe....</span>
</li><li> Even moreso in the sequel. You'd be shocked how much more incentive you have to protect them when they call you 'daddy' and all the creepily cute dialogue they have is directed at <em>you</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em>, Mark Meltzer and by extension his missing daughter Cindy. Anyone who followed the ARG Something In The Sea is very familiar with Mark, and you can find audio diaries detailing his search for Cindy in the game. Many players became obsessed with the idea of helping Mark. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> when you later kill what seems to be a run of the mill Rumbler Big Daddy - only to approach his corpse and discover that it was Mark, who chose to be turned into one in order to protect Cindy. And God help you if you harvested the Little Sister who was with him...</span>
</li><li> It's not just the Little Sisters. There are players who actively try to find a way to collect and cure the girls without harming the Big Daddies...or failing that, get through the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">without collecting</a> any Little Sisters except the ones the storyline forces them to. This is due to the sequel revealing that, whether the Big Daddies were biologically the girls' fathers or not, they still react with utter grief when their "fathers" are killed. This retroactively has the effect of making players who went through the first game feel guilty recalling all the Big Daddies they killed the first time around.
</li><li> Sadly, there is no way in the sequel to get around having to kill the Big Sisters, which is tragic when the game reveals that they are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actually onetime Little Sisters, all grown up</span>.
</li><li> Elizabeth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> was designed for this. The player character is tasked with finding and protecting her, and she's very powerful. She's also very cute, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsSexy">Of Corsets Sexy</a>, her head proportions and hair seem to make her look younger (Okay, she's modeled like a Disney Princess), and the early stages of game's development had a feature where overusing her powers actually harms her. However the final version of the character is actually indestructible.
</li><li> Apparently, melee attacks will upset Elizabeth, causing here to cringe or whimper. A lot of gamers have stopped doing it as a result out of concern for her.
</li><li> This carries on into the <em>Burial at Sea</em> downloadable add-on game, particularly Episode Two where Elizabeth becomes a player character. The game encourages the player to avoid using deadly force (though the weapons are provided) as Elizabeth maintains her distaste for killing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The ending of Episode Two is particularly upsetting for players for whom this trope applies.</span>
</li><li> Another, minor instance in <em>Infinite</em> occurs right at the beginning, at the sick raffle doubling as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">public stoning of an interracial couple.</a> You have the option to try to bean the guy running it with the baseball: it doesn't work, but it does kick off a chain of events that help the couple escape. The couple appears later to thank you if you take this option. One of the developers noted in an interview that not a single tester decided to throw the ball at the couple on their first play-through.
</li><li> It should be noted that although for most of <em>Infinite</em> and its <em>Burial at Sea</em> spin-off you are playing a male character, and a little bit of flirting occurs early on (especially at the start of <em>Burial at Sea</em> Episode 1 due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that version of Elizabeth being depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a></span>), the caring potential for Elizabeth soars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> (and beyond) when the player learns towards the end of the storyline that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Booker is actually Elizabeth's <em>father</em></span>.

<ul><li> There are achievements for saving certain soldiers in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty4">Call Of Duty 4</a></em> and <em>World at War</em>.
</li><li> The first game strips Private Elder of his invulnerable status after Sergeant Moody gives you the explosives during the assault on Brecourt Manor, meaning he'll usually buy the farm about the time you reach the last gun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Screw that, says I.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty4">Call Of Duty 4</a></em>, you get an achievement for saving an innocent farmer in one of the missions from being gunned down.
</li><li> In the Vorkuta level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Black Ops</a></em>, you'll face several times your prisoner allies being clubbed down by the guards. You've the potential to try to save them by stabbing the guards with your shiv to death. The sad part however is that no matter as fast as you try to be, the prisoners dies anyway.

That's why you can air-blast or douse burning players in Mad Milk or Jarate at the expense of your own ammo/weapons. Similarly, many players will sacrifice themselves to protect their Medic or Engineer over themselves.
<ul><li> The characters have various automatic responses depending on what's going on around them. One of these is the 'thanks' response after being healed by a friendly Medic or traveling through a friendly Engineer teleporter. Many Medic and Engineer players attest that it's those little shows of appreciation that keep them playing even if the job itself is horrifically stressful.
</li><li> One of the Pyro's weapons, the Manmelter, actually rewards you for utilizing caring potential. It has the ability to extinguish burning teammates, similarly to the airblast. But doing it with the Manmelter rewards the player with a free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>. This can prove very useful against the enemy team.

One of the most common recipients of the Sandvich is the Medic.

If you sold them good stuff like a primary weapon and some ammo to go along with it, they <em>will</em> equip it right then and there. In vanilla, you can also approach wounded stalkers that are neutral or friendly to you and hand them a medkit to heal them, which also makes the neutral a friend of yours. In a place as unfriendly as the Zone, few things are as satisfying as getting a badly-armed rookie back up and handing him an Abakan so he can survive a few days longer.

Keeping each other alive also has a practical purpose - the more survivors there are alive, the easier it is to avoid the Killer and escape. However, there's nothing stopping you from going back to rescue a downed survivor after the gate has opened and you can escape; you even get an achievement for doing so.
<ul><li> In an interesting variation of this, it's not unheard of for people playing as the Killer to help the last survivor escape by refusing to attack them and even carrying them to the exit. This allows the survivor to collect a lot of Bloodpoints for surviving, at the cost of the Killer losing Bloodpoints for not sacrificing them. As such, doing so is usually just an act of altruism from whoever is playing the Killer.

She is Mio's twinsister and is obviously in need of Mio's help, not just because of her being physically incapacitated, but also because Mayu is too easily influenced by the spirits in Minakami Village.

He becomes your main defense as you try to escape from your deranged pursuers. A major contributing factor towards what ending you get is how well you treat Hewie. You are given the option to praise him at any time, and can heal him if he is injured by giving him dog-only restorative items. If Hewie becomes so injured to point where he lies incapacitated on the ground, you can go over to him and press the 'praise' button to comfort him and get him back on his feet. There is also a part later on in the game where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hewie is shot after he runs off into a forest.

On the other hand, many players find the AI so intolerable ("What the hell!?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> has a very insidious subversion of this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Being caring and protective of Maria is the <em>wrong</em> choice, and nets the player the worst ending, since Maria is a demonic creation of the town designed to test James' faithfulness to Mary.</span>
</li><li> Likewise subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em>. The game has a invisible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> that works in the background, with every monster killed netting ten points and every point of damage taken worth one point. Getting more than 4,000 points leads to the "evil" ending, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Heather is possessed and kills Douglas</span>. The single greatest thing you can do to get the "evil" ending is to... go into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional">confessional</a> and forgive a woman who exacted vengeance on the girl who killed her daughter, later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">realizing what she had done</a>. This single act nets a thousand points. <br/><br/>What really pushes this into a subversion is that the true meaning of Heather forgiving the woman isn't made clear until you play through a second time. By forgiving the woman for her crime, Heather isn't merely soothing her fear and guilt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's accepting the <em>responsibility</em> of forgiving her or not, which Heather, as the reincarnation of Saint Alessa, has the divine right to do. Forgiving her means embracing who she really is, while saying nothing is a rejection of that and a decision to remain on the side of good.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4">Silent Hill 4</a></em>, which ends up with you playing lonely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">Henry</a> protecting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">next-door neighbor, Eileen.</a> With Henry having been trapped in his hellish room for five or six days and counting, Eileen having been beaten within an inch of her life and limping around pitifully behind him, and the player being terrified (this IS Silent Hill), it's hard not to go out of your way to keep Eileen safe and healthy, either out of sympathy for one or both characters, or simply out of not wanting your lone companion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">lose her mind</a> and leave you braving the Otherworld all alone.

To get the best ending in the game you have to attempt to save and/or comfort every person you meet, even the cop who wants to kill you, and not kill a <em>single</em> monster. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This determines whether Murphy was a good man to the bitter end who went to prison to avenge his son and was merely framed for killing Frank (best ending), or if he was a delusional psychopath who murdered his own son, murdered Frank, and didn't give a damn about either (worst ending).</span>

At one point you pick up a dead hand. At another you encounter a vat of liquid which reanimated dead tissue. Drop the hand in the vat and, it comes to life, clambers onto your shoulder, and just sits there. It will occasionally point you in the right direction if you're lost, and it can scare the crap out of an irritating NPC. Since it's one of the only friendly things in the game, many players get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">extremely angry</a> if anything (re-)kills the dead hand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition">Deadly Premonition</a></em> - You play as an FBI agent visiting a small town afflicted by a series of murders. You first meet up with the sheriff and his deputies, who are very unhappy with your interference. Later on they get to know you, and you genuinely start to like them; they take you out to dinner, romance blooms with one, and you help them and the other different and likeable characters around town with their own individual problems. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is almost heartbreaking when you reach the end of the game.</span>

</li><li> A few chapters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> will give you human NPCs that you can save from the monsters roaming the areas. Doing so will usually have them reward you with some information and a helpful item, or at the very least their gratitude.
</li><li> The first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeepSleepTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeepSleepTrilogy">Deep Sleep Trilogy</a></em> says that a boy named Cody won't be able to wake up without his toy tiger. While exploring the area in the second game you'll find Cody's bed in an orphanage, along with the toy tiger in question. If you remember to put the tiger on the bed... nothing happens, it doesn't advance the plot in any way. But you do get a special scene in the ending of a newspaper clipping where a comatose child named Cody will wake up from a coma.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">Gregory Horror Show</a></em> videogame has Neko Zombie, who teaches you the rules and dangers of the hotel. You can bring him food to help him with his constant starvation, sometimes receiving items in return (in particular, giving him his favourite food is one of the few ways you can get the rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp">Angel Herb</a>).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> slightly invokes this trope in the Death Knight starting quest line when you have to execute a member of your own race that you knew way back after he/she pleads with you to come to your senses.
<ul><li> And again in the quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">The Mosswalker Savior</a>, which can very suddenly turn around the player's feelings about the Oracles.
</li><li> You get decent XP for the quest line, but that's <em>not</em> why you will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">go through hell</a> to help little <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LcJXckn0Lo">Pamela Redpath<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">find her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption">daddy</a>.
<ul><li> While the Redpath questline is less intensive in Cataclysm, now the Eastern Plaguelands has an entire group of NPCs you travel with. Hearing things like the two paladins are childhood friends, or the Argent Crusader has been having trouble the last few years with his duties due to age, or even just that Gideon wants to kiss Fiona all make the player more attached to them. Which makes it so that Gideon's kidnapping results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>. At the end of the extremely long questline, Fiona gives the player a rare item, saying that it's something the entire caravan worked on for you and tells the you that you're welcome to join her caravan any time.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to Pamela Redpath is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowhead.com/uuna-storyline-a-dark-place">Uuna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a ghostly draenei girl. By the time you've wrapped up her storyline, you've killed the monstrosity she was fused into, befriended her, leapt across the fragments of a ruined world to find her doll, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">yourself to search for her</a> when she's dragged into the spirit world by shadowy tentacles, and protected her from innumerable and unkillable nightmarish shadow-mobs. There are no tangible rewards for doing this, nor for the victory lap of taking her to see the sights around Azeroth and Draenor: these aren't quests, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">often-hidden options for interaction and dialogue triggered by particular locations</a>, so there is no gold nor XP. At the end, though, when you've shown her that there are people of her race still alive and well, she's happy to stay with you a while longer. And when you /hug her, she'll /hug you right back. You've earned it.
</li><li> The game invokes this in a TRINKET with the badlands quest reward <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">Rhea's Last Egg</a>. Especially with the descriptive text "Please take care of him for me."</span>
</li><li> The craft skill Inscription has 'Forged Documents' as one of the higher level items. Once per day, you can make them and get a quest to turn them in to one of about six random people in the major city. One of them on the alliance side is Thomas Miller the baker, but if you give them to him you will probably feel like you just kicked a blind kid's one legged puppy. "My bread made someone sick? I hope my meager savings will help..."
</li><li> There is a zone in the Hillsbrad Foothills where the player can find humans buried by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> in the ground with their heads sticking out, while surrounded by man-eating ghouls. The player, who at that point has done a good number of dog-kicking and killed plenty of humans, can choose to use a shovel to set them free - or to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> them with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShovelStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShovelStrike">Shovel Strike</a>.
</li><li> A minor example for Alliance players in the Twilight Highlands is the "Small Comforts" sidequest. You're sent to retrieve various trinkets for dwarves who've lost their home. While it does mean you have to fetch them all over again, you can choose to give them to the dwarves in question instead of the quest giver. One of them insists that there will always be a spot for you at his dinner table after giving him back a hammer that had been in his family for generations. A very young dwarf asks if you've lost your home too and offers to let you sit next to her before you even give back her bear. The last is a widow who thanks you profusely for retrieving some dried flowers her husband gave her.
</li><li> The quests in Westfall as of Cataclysm all revolve around clearing the zone of hostile beings, gathering supplies, and feeding the homeless. In other words, you're helping these people get back on their feet and stay there. It's very satisfying.
</li><li> One of the Tillers dailies has you collect debts from various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> around town. Every day two of them have trouble paying. While a couple of the NPCs just don't want to pay, one is saving up to leave town and the other needs the money to either repair her inn or feed her family. Players can choose to threaten them into paying or pay the debt themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>: A lazy or selfish player could send his away team ahead on ground missions to do all the dirty work for him, and if they die there's very little in the way of penalties. Similarly, Tactical Captains gain a power to summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> security officers; as one might expect, they have very low health and their primary usage is as cannon fodder. It can be quite satisfying to keep them alive, though.
<ul><li> For the space segments, there are a few missions with NPC ships that are under attack when you warp in. In particular, the Deferi sector has a repeatable mission which involves stopping an attack on a convoy of weakly armed transport ships. There's absolutely no reward for saving them, aside from a little extra firepower throughout the rest of the mission, but it's hard to let them just get destroyed.
</li><li> Also in Deferi sector, there's an optional encounter with a Breen starship. Your tactical officer will detect Deferi lifesigns aboard, so you're given the option to hail the ship. The Breen will let you talk to the (Obviously scared) Deferi captive, who pretends to be an exchange officer. At this point, there are several choices: You can buy the Deferi slave outright with Latinum, you can destroy the ship with the Deferi still aboard, or you can employ a sensor-disrupting tactic to beam the Deferi straight to your ship. In an especially unusual twist, you can then either destroy the Breen ship or take the Deferi and leave the Breen ship intact. This is one case where not only is it wise to show compassion for your allies, but for your enemy as well. Unfortunately for the Klingons, the only option to rescue the Deferi is to buy them with Gold Pressed Latinum. If you destroy the ship (which Klingons would suggest doing anyway) while the Deferi is on board, then you blame them for being weak enough to get captured in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vindictus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vindictus">Vindictus</a></em>. Ellis, who happens to be an annoyingly naive cadet who follows around an army official and happens to eventually grow on you. Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in Ainle, where you are supposedly exploring a dungeon with him, you watch his face get smashed in by a boss.

</li><li> Ever lose a cat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>? A kitten becomes a cat after ten real-time hours of being fed and petted. Alongside loving being stroked and enjoying play, a cat is the key to at least three quests. One of those quests involves mucking around inside a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">pyramid</a> <em>without</em> being able to set the cat down. Since the rules concerning item loss-on-player death are linked to the price of items (your armor <em>is</em> more expensive than your cat) and you can only lose what you are actually holding, this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck">frustrating</a>.
<ul><li> Hell, it's easy to get attached to any of the pets. You'd be surprised how much you can like a giant crab.
</li><li> When players die in <em>RuneScape</em>, all of the items they lost on death are kept under a short-lived gravestone. Given that the most dangerous areas and a long way from the nearest respawn, it's not unlikely that you'll lose a lot because you couldn't get back in time. However, other players can repair your gravestone, giving you precious minutes so you can get your armour back... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">or they can just watch the gravestone wither away and take what used to be yours...</a>
</li><li> The game's most infamous emotional gut-punch comes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> quest "While Guthix Sleeps," in which a whole bunch of the players allies from previous quests and skill training are unceremoniously slaughtered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, with you powerless to do anything about it. Particularly mourned is the wise old gnome Hazelmere, who is the first to die; he's burned to ashes by a bolt of lightning, leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHatShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHatShot">only his hat behind</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> follows their usual standard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>. If you do a good turn for the various NPCs you meet during your quests, they'll frequently send you an in-game email with their heartfelt, and heartwarming, thanks.
<ul><li> Likewise, each of the eight character classes has five Companion Characters. Being a dick to them usually makes you feel like an utter heel. Win their affection, though, and you can unlock new quests or even trigger a romance subplot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> second chapter, Factions, has a mission on the Luxon side, Gyala Hatchery. Normally, escort missions can be a pain, particularly if the AI you are guiding is prone to wading into combat (I'm looking at -you-, Rurik). Gyala Hatchery inspires players to go for the Master-level mission completion due to the fact that you must protect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">3 newly hatched Siege Turtles, which waddle around in the middle of the group</a>. Sure, they'll grow up to be artillery-carrying weapons of mass destruction, but it's hard not to feel bad when one bites the dust.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>: half the quests boil down to search and rescue and disaster relief. Loot and experience are far less persnickety than one might expect, so you've nothing to lose by pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> on any random player about to keel over.

</li></ul></li><li> Being nice to noobs (more often just new to the server than just multiplayer) is not the norm as they are usually characterized as all being thieves and griefers. Many players will even try to scam them out of what little they have or raid their dirt and cobblestone houses. However if you let them stay at your large manor house or secret underground base they will usually be more than grateful, (so long as you made sure they weren't a thief) and it can be rewarding to have another person help out. And come on, everyone is a noob once.
</li><li> Tamed wolves. Part of the appeal is having them serve as attack wolves to do your hunting and fighting for you. The other half is getting together a small entourage of those cute puppy-eyed critters and either keeping them home safe or taking them on adventures with you.

The reality is the game simply was an interactive movie with limited actual interaction by the player (basically of the "save her" or "let her die" choice variety), and any "caring" was limited to players who might have developed a crush on the actress playing Kat, given that the scenes occasionally called for her to express fear, etc. on occasion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TangerineTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TangerineTycoon">Tangerine Tycoon</a></em>, refusing to put the cat into your tangerine machine will force you to skip one tier of upgrades, but in the next playthroughs you will get thanked by the cats and its friends with some extra tangerines to help you get started.

Had they not tranquilized Stitches and left him a portrait of the Metal Glen's patients happy together (from before everything went to hell in a handbasket), then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He wouldn't have pulled an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles' Lion</a> and saved them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Ace</a>. They also managed to make the ending just that much sweeter by saving another patient, Jay, who was trapped in the water filtration system by hooks</span>. It's notable that they weren't <em>supposed</em> to do this, as they were only able to take Stitches down non-lethally because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">bashed open</a> a cabinet with tranquilizer inside instead of getting the key, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Weaver had never even considered that they would try to save Jay, and allowed it because he couldn't see any reason why they <em>couldn't</em> do it.</span>
</li><li> The story of Noh is a legendary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> example. It goes like this: A group of players were doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a> when they came upon an ornate and obviously magical sword and chainmail shirt. The items were guarded by a young girl (really a physical manifestation of a minor spirit) who could only say 'no' and (if saying no would be misleading) 'please do not take these items'. It was <em>supposed</em> to be a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> just wanted to see if they would take them when the girl was asking them not to. The party bard tried to use music to 'awaken her dormant soul', and rolled high enough that the DM let her shed a single tear. The players promptly suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity">Cuteness Proximity</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">decided to take the girl instead of the items</a>. They took her with them (when she tried to return to the items to fulfill her purpose they simply put the items on her instead), risked their lives for her, and named her 'Noh' since it was what she said when asked her name. The DM allowed them to keep her for good.

</li><li> One person you encounter, when you offer to trade, says "I only have this gold staff to offer" and of course - since their boat is out of food, the right thing to do is to give him anything edible.
</li><li> Another woman will say "I don't have anything to offer" when you offer to trade with her - naturally if you give her a map, she will say "Thank you!" because it helps her find what she's looking for.

You grow <em>very</em> attached to the animals you care of, and the guests, while very demanding, will be rewarding assets if you serve their needs correctly. Getting a 5-star zoo is all about making sure all your animals and guests are happy, and it is very rewarding when you finally get a 5-star zoo considering how difficult it can be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders">Dragon Quest Builders</a></em> does its best to try to get you to <em>want</em> to help the assorted villagers you come across. You don't have to build them unique rooms and decent beds; but they'll return the favor when you do with applause, battle support (if they're capable), and crafting items like food while you're away that you can pick up later.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a></em> takes this even further due to changes in how towns level up compared to the first game (where it was solely determined by the combined quality of all the buildings). NPCs will drop Gratitude Points (which funtions as both EXP and currency for getting items in the post-game) any time they feel thankful towards the Builder, which happens everytime you complete a quest, do tasks for them, or just as they go about their days and use the various buildings you've made for them. Making sure that all their needs are met is key to bringing in a steady supply of Gratitude Points, and they'll drop more if the rooms match up with their personal tastes (measured in size, mood, and fanciness).

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OddWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OddWorld">Oddworld</a></em> games really inspire this, not only because rescuing the lanky, bug-eyed Mudokons and little furry Fuzzles is the goal of the game and not doing so has... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding">unfavourable consequences</a> for the heroes.

Most of the games also feature certain scenarios with diplomatic solutions. Sure, it's easy to wipe out a tribe of kobolds or lizardmen, but it's much more satisfying to earn their trust, arrange for peaceful cohabitation with humans, and have them consider you an honored friend.

<ul><li> Minsc's epilogue will have you shed a tear, guaranteed.
</li><li> Imoen in the first game is your childhood friend and also the first person coming to help you after the ambush at the end of the prologue, triggering many sensibilities. She's also one of the best thieves in the game (and perhaps the best, considering she's available right at the beginning and you can later dual her to a mage/thief), thus a good asset per se. In the second game, she suffers atrocious physical pain and psychological abuses that leave her more than a scar, not counting what it's took away from her in midgame, and basically the first half of the game revolves around rescuing and assisting her. You also discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she is your actual sister</span>. Finally, she won't leave the party even if your reputation is abysmal, such is her loyalty to you. If you already liked her before, now you'd bet that you would go even to hell for her.
</li><li> Still about Imoen, in Siege of Dragonspear, you have plenty of dialogues where you can say her that you care and one occasion where you might choose to magically farsee one person that is relevant to you: what the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is planning, what the mysterious hooded man is doing, or how is Imoen while recovering after being poisoned. It's almost a one-sided choice for fan-service.
</li><li> Who would break the relationship between the old, faithful Keldorn and his family? Also, his epilogue is tearful just like Minsc's.
</li><li> Aerie's romance arc, as long you can endure her initial whining. This girl have gone through hell. Being captured by slavers, sold as a circus freak because of her wings. Having said wings becoming diseased and amputated medieval style to save her life have turned her into a almost literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>. However, if you romance her and follow the arc through, her ending is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">happiest in the game</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Travelling to her former home, finding her parents who never gave up their search for her and getting married with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Gorion's Ward</a> there.</span>
</li><li> Even if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yoshimo</span> can't help but betray you, you can still follow his last wish and bring his heart to a priest of Ilmater in order to relieve his soul from his curse. If you do that, the priest asks to tell him about this man and you have two dialogue choices: either coldly point out that he was simply a traitor and you don't know if he was lying with his request, or call him "a friend that was forced into treachery".

<ul><li> It's hard to be cruel to cute little Wild Flower...and <em>so</em> satisfying to kick that nasty demon that's bothering her into next week.
</li><li> Kicking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sun Li</span>'s ass is <em>very</em> satisfying after hearing him insult Dawn Star (the sweetest, nicest person in your party) to her face.

She was rescued, but grabbed a weapon away and hid. She talks about herself in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">third person</a>, and you can either rush in and jab her with a sedative or talk to her, approaching slowly, and administer it without spooking her. On the way you can learn some of the details about what happened and tell her it's not her fault. If you play it right, you can convince her to take the sedative herself, then, as she falls asleep in your arms, whisper the following to her:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Shepard:</strong> You'll dream of a warm place. And when you wake up, you'll be in it.

</li><li> In the sequel, you get an email from her with her using the first person, thanking you and saying she's getting better. Yep, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">Good Feels Good</a>.

And, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the (completely necessary) Paragon Interrupt to hug Tali.</span>
<ul><li> The Suicide Mission is a big one. It's possible to lose nearly everyone (including Shepard!) — in the worst ending, only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joker and EDI</span> survive, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">it is possible to get everyone through</a>.
</li><li> You can encounter a quarian on her Pilgrimage, being harassed by security on a false claim of thievery. Shepard can mention he/she has knowledge of the quarians, and he/she's genuinely shocked that an alien would bother to know anything about her race. The tone suggests that s/he's the first person to speak to her like a normal person since she left the Flotilla. And you can tell the people harrassing her to piss off with an Interrupt.

</li><li> The ending of the Overlord DLC: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaving David with his brother to suffer more of his experiments</span> is something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">even the most die-hard of Renegade players shy away from</a>. The ending also has die-hard Paragons clamour for an option to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">take David and kill Archer.</span> If you do the right thing, this is later followed up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">David has recovered from his ordeal, and is safe and happy.</span>
</li><li> Early on in the game you're hunting down Archangel and find out about a concerted effort by nearly every local crime syndicate to take down a vigilante. They're sending in wave after wave of dumb mercenaries as cannon fodder—death is a guarantee. Just after Shepard signs up to infiltrate the groups, a dumb hotshot kid comes in to join. It's obvious that this kid won't last two seconds, and a Paragon interrupt has Shepard take his gun from him, sabotages it and send him off. Later, you get an email from him thanking you for saving his life.
</li><li> After Jacob's loyalty mission, it's nice to hear from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the women his dad abused</span>, saying she's getting better.
</li><li> After Grunt's loyalty mission, it's not something that comes immediately, but you essentially gave Grunt a reason to live. You gave him a family in Clan Urdnot, a proper father figure if Wrex survived Virmire, and, if you killed the thresher maw, you gave him the respect of God knows how many krogan. For a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">tank-bred</a>, that's not bad.
</li><li> Pretty much every loyalty mission has this in some way if you get the best result. You get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">Garrus to realise he was becoming the very thing he swore to stamp out</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Miranda to reconnect with her beloved sister</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheAbusiveHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyTheAbusiveHome">Jack gets to bury her demons regarding her past</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilParentsWantGoodKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilParentsWantGoodKids">Thane stops his son following in his footsteps in a job he regrets</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Tali is welcomed back to the Migrant Fleet after she was threatened with exile</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">Kasumi engages on the most important heist of her life to recover the last remaining fragment of her partner and lover</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">prevent Samara from killing herself to save her last living daughter</a>.
</li><li> After the suicide mission, if you romanced a crew member and they lived, you can invite them up to your cabin to cuddle.
</li><li> If you romanced Tali in 2 and make sure she survives the suicide mission, when you meet up again in 3, she says that she left a present for in your cabin. What do you find? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A picture of her without her suit on</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has this both in companion-related quests and in dialogue at camp. Though in one case there's an odd subversion: Alistair's companion quest. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He wants to go to Denerim to meet his long-lost half-sister. No matter what dialogue options you choose, there is no way for this encounter to end well, and Alistair is badly upset by it... but if you choose the "some people are selfish" dialogue option afterwards, this turns out to be a crucial turning point that can result in Alistair being "hardened"... which opens up some positive outcomes later on. In fact, if you're playing as a female character romancing him, it's the only way outside of playing a human noble and becoming queen yourself that your relationship will survive if you end up making him king.</span>
<ul><li> Leliana and Alistair are this in general, especially if you romance one of them. They're both just too damn sweet and cute.
</li><li> The team's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a>, Morrigan, comes across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> to most of the cast. This can also extend to the player. But if the PC shows her respect and treats her well, it is possible to befriend or romance her.

"The Fair Lady", the leader of the Chaos Servant covenant who is a beautiful naked woman from the waist up and a hideous demon spider below that (just like her sister, who you had to kill to reach her as one of the game's more iconic bosses). Unlike Quelaag, though, the Fair Lady is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">deathly ill</a> due to selflessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sucking the blight pus from the infected people of Blighttown</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealing">taking their illness onto herself</a> and leaving herself near death.

She mistakes you for her beloved sister due to her blindness, and you can level up in the covenant by giving her Humanity to help ease her suffering (and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">your own guilt for killing Quelaag, robbing her of the one she loved the most</a>). You get all the practical rewards from the covenant (the powerful Chaos Storm pyromancy and access to a useful shortcut) once you've donated 30 Humanity to reach the 2nd tier; the 3rd tier (at <em>80</em> Humanity) does nothing except visibly relieve the Fair Lady's pain (her legs stop spasming and she talks in a less-pained voice). Expecting players to go that far for a merely cosmetic reward would be enough, but some people have actually gone beyond it to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> on how much Humanity you can gift her, even without any kind of reward.

For starters, your main protagonist begins as a six year old, and about as competent in combat- but your father Pankraz frequently helps you travel the world, fights your enemies and heals your wounds. Come the second act, you're on your own, with nothing more than an enigmatic quest to find your mother and make your father proud. Along the way, you will marry a woman and bear children (and name them, as well)- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Only to be separated from them for eight years and forced to watch the childhood, and subsequent capture, of another boy.</span> Come third generation, you will almost feel the determination the protagonist has to save the world, his mother and his wife with the help of his kids, his father's right-hand man, a ragtag group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> (some of whom you recruited in the second generation and fought beside you when you had no other allies) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and a random soldier</a>.

</li><li> One quest in the Fighters Guild has a woman named Biene Amelion hire you to raid her family's crypt and fetch some artifacts that she hopes she can sell off and clear some debts accumulated by her father. You can choose to forgo that entirely and just pay the debt off yourself.

There is no quest requirement for this.
<ul><li> The <em>Hearthfire</em> DLC allows you to adopt and raise orphaned children. They will live in one of your houses and you can give them gifts and play games with them.
</li><li> The game allows the player to actually marry a companion. Although domesticity is at a minimum, the option does exist for one to keep a spouse out of harm's way, and a spouse can also be killed in action.

<ul><li> A great many players developed an attachment to recurring NPC Dogmeat, going to great lengths to keep him alive despite being more of a liability than anything else.

Bethesda seemingly took note of this trend, as the <em>Fallout 3</em> DLC <em>Broken Steel</em> introduced a Perk called 'Puppies!' that specifically lets Dogmeat respawn if killed. He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">comes back</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">tougher</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> in general can involve a lot of this for a good character. Things like saving Big Town give you a real warm and fuzzy feeling, especially if you don't ask for a reward. Although it makes money a little harder to come by, the role-playing satisfaction inherent in being good to Big Town and Megaton and Rivet City and anywhere else decent people are just trying to get by is one of the best parts of the game for a good character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, reports of your exploits are also spread by the disc jockey Three Dog, who pays increasing tribute to you. You also get random encounters from inhabitants of the wasteland thanking you for everything you're going for them. It can increase the warm-and-fuzziness.
<ul><li> Though sometimes at the cost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">sheer rage induction</a>. Try making regular roundtrips to Megaton to maintain your stash when your Karma hits Very Good status (which is actually a lot harder to avoid than you think). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">limitations</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">mechanics</a> of the dialogues will turn your rewards into an unbearable punishment.
</li></ul></li><li> Both excessively Good and Evil karma will also cause random encounters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">either the Regulators or Talon Company</a>. Or both, if you've crossed the line more than once.

In the base game it's a pretty useful companion that the player is encouraged to bond with, but then it got a DLC focused around its counterpart. In Lonesome Road, a clone of ED-E is your only companion in The Divide, which is a post Apocalyptic Hell-scape. This ED-E's beeps are more diverse and it reveals more of its backstory through Audio-Logs, and your dialogue options with it become much more conversational and diverse. You can either choose to respond to it with love and acceptance or blatantly tell it that it is a machine and that you don't care about its problems.
<ul><li> In the first story quest, you can either protect Goodsprings from the Powder Gangers or help them wipe it off the map. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even evil players</a> tend to lean towards the former.
</li><li> In Fortification Hill, you meet a little slave girl named Melody, whose teddy bear was stolen by one of the legionnaires. To get the bear back, you can swipe it from him or you can fight a few of his hounds while armorless and armed with only a machete. The fact that she's a little slave girl you can't rescue without mods makes this the only act of kindness the player could afford her, short of massacring the entire legion.
</li><li> Of course, mods <em>do</em> exist to save both her and other slaves, and the fact that people went out of their way to make them is a sort of Caring Potential in its own right.
</li><li> There's your companions. each of them is well written, well voiced, incredibly helpful, and, thankfully, in casual mode, quite immortal. However, in Hardcore mode, they can (and almost certainly will) die. For this reason, more than a few people avoid taking companions with them in Hardcore mode, seeing as how they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">couldn't bear the thought of seeing their friends die.</a>
</li><li> Then there's the towns, filled with nice, charming, helpful citizens who will give you discounts and free stuff once you've done them a few small favors. Makes it a hell of a lot harder for you to come back in your next playthrough and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">murder them all horribly with a chainsaw,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">doesn't it?</a>

This includes rescuing Sulik's sister from the slaver camp, curing Cassidy's heart condition, buying a set of armor for Marcus and K-9/Dogmeat, and preventing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">peaceful talking deathclaws being massacred by the Enclave</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, you can help build a number of safe, comfortable settlements for destitute wastelanders to take refuge in, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the lonely old Vault-Tec salesman you meet at the start of the game</span>. You can rebuild the Minutemen and help them keep these settlements protected.

<ul><li> That sort of thing happens with Miluda, which is an enemy example. You have to fight her twice and there's no way around it.
</li><li> It's quite the Wham moment the first time you go to the effort of having a Mediator with Invite in the party specifically for that fight, go out of your way to incapacitate all of her allies, and then learn that no, there's no way you can convince her to join your side.
</li><li> Some players will go out of their way to save their generic party members from death (if any character stays at "knocked out" status for too long, they die permanently), even if it means restarting a battle that is almost over.
</li><li> Similarly in <em>Tactics</em>, if you ever try and manually dismiss a party member from the menu screen, they give a "Do you really want to do this" speech. With generic team mates it hurts the soul a bit, and with unique characters it hurts a bit more, but at least they're just sad about leaving. Monsters, however - all but one of which the player will have personally recruited via Mediators - are heartbreaking because not only are they sad at having to leave, <em>they don't understand what's going on.</em>

<ul><li> There is a segment when you have to take care of another character by feeding him fish. Whether he lives or dies doesn't matter to the story as the game progresses either way, but there's something oddly rewarding in keeping him alive.
</li><li> On the other hand, the emotional impact of the story is much greater if he dies, so some players try to make him die on purpose. Of course, since the mechanics of the fishing minigame are never explained, there's high chance the result during your first playthrough will be random anyway.
</li><li> Perhaps especially notable, as the person you save is in fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the guy who created and maintained the machines that suck the life energy out of magical creatures, and who was utterly furious at you when you turned said machines off.</span>

Likewise, while getting most of the character back in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">World of Ruin</a> is optional, they're likable enough that you're likely to want to help them.

The most famous one, near the end of the game, is when you confront the Turks one last time. If you did a sidequest earlier in which you teamed up with them, you can choose not to fight. The two sides make peace and go their separate ways. An earlier example is when you steal a submarine and encounter a trio of Shinra goons guarding it... except it's those same goons you befriended earlier in the game when you were undercover. You can choose to simply take the guards prisoner instead of killing them.
<ul><li> Also, in an inversion, Rude has a crush on Tifa, as he tells Reno at one point. If she's the only party member left standing, he has a 50% chance of hesitating and skipping his turn! So the game cares about you, too!
</li><li> Another moment comes when your party is on the way to Corel. You can investigate a Cokatolis nest and find some adorable baby chicks...which happen to be surrounded by Phoenix Downs. You can choose to leave them be or grab the treasure.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you pick the second option, their angry mother comes to call.</span>

This version introduced the happiness mechanic, but <em>only</em> for Pikachu — you could look at it and see how it liked you. So you wanted to keep it happy by using it in battle but not letting it faint, not keeping it locked up in the PC, etc. (Or you could just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">repeatedly use the Potion from your PC on it at full health and get it to love you in two minutes flat.</a>)
<ul><li> In the remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em>, <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, you can have not only Pikachu out and about with you, but <em>any</em> Pokémon you want. So if Pikachu couldn't earn your love, now you've got options.
<ul><li> Not only that, but can get to interact with them in a much deeper level. At first they will get angry at you repeatedly, but if you care well about them they will go as far as play with you and look for flowers and things to give to you.
</li></ul></li><li> Nicknaming your Pokémon will inevitably lead to you caring about them. And getting pissed at enemies who K.O. your little Pichu. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">And then you bust out your Level 100 Charizard and barbecue the NPC's team of Grass-types.</a>
</li><li> Ever since the happiness system was introduced in Gen II, you try to keep your Pokémon happy, even if only for those that evolve because of it. Interestingly, there's a move that increases in power for this (Return), and one for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">how much they hate you</a> (Frustration).
</li><li> Forging a deeper connection with your Pokémon is pretty much the whole point of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NuzlockeComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NuzlockeComics">Nuzlocke</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Challenge run</a>. If a Pokémon faints, it is "dead" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">can never be used again</a>, the number of Pokémon you can catch is also limited, which makes you use species that would've been overlooked otherwise, and you also have to name every one you catch. When done right, every lost party member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">feels like a punch in the gut.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> Something completely unrelated to the Pokémon themselves, however, is an optional sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> and its remake, <em>Platinum</em>. In it, there is a cave beneath Cycling Road named Wayward Cave, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. In the furthest point of the cave is a young girl named Mira, whose sprite looks to be about half the height of your character's. She has a lone Kadabra without Teleport, Dig, Rock Smash (required to get through the cave), or Flash. She begs you to escort her out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">which your character does without your input</a> (you'd have to have a heart of ice to refuse, though). What really makes this an example is that Mira really doesn't give you much of a reward for saving her, other than you being able to rebattle her in the Battleground or team up with her in the Battle Tower later, neither of which are very significant in themselves. Saving her is completely optional, too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> kicks in when you think about the real-life implications of being stuck in a dark cave with literally no way of escape, and exactly how terrifying it would be to a little girl.
</li><li> Pokémon-Amie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> was made with this in mind, allowing you to interact with your Pokémon by petting them, feeding them cake, playing games with them, and making faces at them (which they'll try to imitate), among other things. A Pokémon that's become fond of you through this will also gain numerous benefits in battle, along with the battle text being changed to emphasize the bond they share with you. This feature was retained for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, with minor changes, in the form of the PlayNav and Pokémon Refresh.
<ul><li> One of the benefits to a Pokémon with high affection is that sometimes it will tank a hit that would otherwise knock it out, only to say that it "hung on out of love for its Trainer." Likewise, a particularly affectionate Pokémon may muster up all their willpower to break through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> "to keep you from worrying," as well as dodge enemy attacks regardless of their accuracy.
</li></ul></li><li> Metagame example: The internet interaction beginning with <em>X/Y</em>. For Wonder Trade, send over a rare Pokémon, or, any Pokémon with perfect IVs, Egg Moves, and/or Pokérus. For O-Power, send your highest O-Power. For the Global Trade Station, offer a rare Pokémon for something more common.
</li><li> There's a small example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Hoenn</a> remakes; on an early route, you'll encounter an NPC who complains that his Pokémon is really tired and he should have brought a potion. The NPC was also in the originals, but this time around, if you have a potion, the game will allow you to give it to him. You don't get a reward for doing this, other than the NPC thanking you, but it is a nice little touch.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> adventure/RPG series has the character classes of fighter, mage, thief and paladin. Becoming and playing as the latter requires going well out of the way of the rest of the game mechanics to do Right. Some of a paladin's deeds are too rewarding to count as simple altruism (returning a reward, telling a disarmed enemy to re-arm -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a>), others likely count (snuggling a rotting undead -&gt; one released spirit, you smelling and waist deep in a lake).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher">Snatcher</a></em>, you can reconcile with your wife, or help an elderly Freeman return to his family before death.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, not only can you spare every monster in the game, up to and including the bosses, you can take it one step further and hang out with several of the boss monsters after fighting them. In fact, you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">avoid killing anything</a> and make friends with several characters in order to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>. The game also gives you several chances to back out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">No Mercy run</a>, and not doing so will have the game remind you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster">just how terrible of a person you are</a>.
<ul><li> You can talk to a snowman who wants to see the world and agree to carry a piece of him with you on your travels. The snowman piece is a very good healing item which can make it tempting to just eat it but if you instead keep it all the way through the final boss fight, the epilogue will have either Sans comment that "you made a snowman really happy" or the snowman himself thank you if you backtrack to talk to him again.

None of these actions effect the endings other than small dialogue changes—in fact, except for Muffet (who has one by default), the characters don't even get yellow names—but it still feels nice to help out.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> credits tells you what happened to each of the monsters you encountered after the game. The bosses all get short cutscenes, but the random enemies just get short blurbs, which can either be white or yellow. Yellow blurbs have different text and indicate that the monster's life has been more fulfilling because of some action you took when you encountered them. Getting every single yellow blurb is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, but it's <em>incredibly</em> rewarding to know that the monsters are all leading happy, fulfilling lives because of your actions.
</li><li> The whole backtrack after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> is itself this. If you go back to the very first Froggit you met, who asked you to spare a little mercy towards monsters you may encounter, it will say, "I don't know if it's because of what I said, but it appears you have grown to be a kind and conscientious person.", basically thanking you for following his advice and saying how proud he is of you.
</li><li> Nothing is stopping you from being a complete jerk throughout the game, and doing so doesn't bar you from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, just so long as your jerk behavior doesn't extend to killing. Still, most players find they don't have it in them to do things like call Papyrus a loser or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refuse to forgive and comfort Asriel.</span>
</li><li> No matter how you play the game, one of the characters will always pass judgment on you right before the final boss. If you didn't kill anyone, he'll say that you didn't gain LV, but you did gain love, and that though you didn't kill anyone, that doesn't make you naive or a coward, it only means you kept a tenderness in your heart and that even when you ran away from a fight, you did it with a smile.

Each and every one of those 50-odd soldiers have their own appearance, traits, skills, backstory, and future life that they will go on to after the ending - IF they're still alive. And thanks to the fairly well-balanced AI, the only way they're going to die, is if YOU screw up. And yes, they have death-sequences with lines, calling out to loved ones, declaring their loyalty to the nation, the unit, or even just to you, as they draw their last breath... which, of course, makes you hate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Damon</a> with the burning intensity of a thousand suns when he starts treating the militiamen as expendable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>.

<ul><li> Zhao, a Chinese ex-gangster, gave you information to fulfill a debt of honor, and now his gang is trying to kill him for helping you; he's so stoic about his fate that it just seems wrong if you can't kill the enemy fast enough to keep him alive, even though you get the information either way.
</li><li> A Japanese girl came to America hunting a demon that slaughtered her master, and you've helped her find that demon; even if she dies in the fight, you can still kill the demon and get the mission XP, but who really wants to see Yukie die after coming so far for vengeance?
</li><li> A confused elderly scholar got kidnapped for his knowledge of an ancient sarcophagus, and you needed to rescue him for that same info. When you find him, he's polite, helpful, scared, clad only in a bathrobe, locked inside a damp corner of a cave, and willing to tell you everything he knows for even a hope of rescue. Once his captors set off the bombs and bring down the entire cave in a last-ditch effort to kill you, you can either sprint off on your own and make much better time, or take the time to lead out Dr. Johansen while trying to ignore that big flashing death timer on your screen.

The process creates a "blood bond" meaning she falls in love with you (though this is closer to an addiction to your presense and blood), and she will ask to stay with you, offering you her college money and other assistance, including ultimately the best armour in the game. However <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you keep her around she will tell she is being followed and will eventually be killed by your enemies in a cutscene</span>.

If you visit the town before this happens, you'll see a group of kids playing by a river just outside of the town. They stand on each others' shoulders to try to get a persimmon out of the tree. When you come back and they've become trees, the children were still standing on each other, and so they collapsed, with one of the children landing in the river. At this point, you can either walk into the water and pull the kid-tree into the shallows, or go on with your business. Once the plot's moved on and the people are restored to human form, the child will thank you and give you a little reward. It doesn't take much effort to save her, and the reward is small. However, if you don't save her, the other two children she was playing with will mope around and give heartrendingly sad statements about the fate of their friend. That alone is enough to make you want to restart...

You can kick them awake, which tends to reward you with an item.
<ul><li> Some demons will actually beg for their lives if you beat them within an inch of it. It's surprisingly satisfying to have something like a giant snake demon thank you for sparing him, or even join you out of appreciation.

Either way, you do feel lousy for the death of your characters, which are sometimes friends with your other characters, or even family. It also doesn't help that many of the best endings and secrets are unlocked by making it to the end of the game with all 108 characters alive.
<ul><li> Certain characters will die outside of your control in final stages of each game. There's absolutely nothing you can do about it; their deaths are part of the ending.

Normal Sustaining Spoons can make enough bland (but nutritious) gruel to feed six people a day, but the only limit on how many times you can use the Spoons Of Plenty is the amount of time it takes to activate them for each bowl. In Episode 18, the party finally delivers them to the government of Vistria, a human kingdom overrun with refugees after the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Kua-Toa</a> conquered the adjacent human kingdom of Verandi. By Episode 20, the spoons are in full swing, and are lifting <em>twenty-five thousand</em> war refugees out of borderline starvation.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many quest characters remain in your village after they stop being important, so you can keep them with you until the end. If you keep track of names, it's possible to watch over specific villagers throughout their entire lives and take them with you into new lands, even as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">age and infirmity</a> makes it harder and harder to forestall the inevitable.
</li><li> No matter how much of a monster you are, your creature always loves you and believes the best of you. You can pet it until it turns into a puddle of happy goo, decorate its pen with things it likes, and teach it to become a beloved guardian of the villagers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> names every single one of your dwarves, all the elves, all the humans etc. It also names monsters and animals that kill things, which can lead to situations like having a giant bat called "Bridgebane the Hammer of Pacifism". And who <em>wouldn't</em> want to keep a bat with a name like that alive?
<ul><li> The guy who lost half his military to the damn thing. The "batman" creatures (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace">according to the DF Wiki, they CAN breathe in space</a>) are often assigned names because your dwarves feel like it, and are far better for the purposes of this trope because they didn't get that name by <em>butchering your dwarves</em>.
<ul><li> This happens because your dwarves have <em>favorite animals</em>. A fortress with a dwarf who likes a certain type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">anthro creature</a> will end up with every member of a tribe of, for instance, slug men each having unique names.
</li></ul></li><li> Nor the detailed relationships between all your dwarves with spouses, children, lovers, friends, acquaintances, enemies, and several levels between.
</li><li> Add to that making personality a factor in behavior — an irritable noble who demands crap you can't produce gets sent quickly to the killing chambers, a laid back noble who requests things you're producing anyway is an unexpected gift.
</li><li> Your original 7 dwarves work <em>so hard</em> to get your fortress off the ground. It's not fun when one of them dies, especially if it's a particularly stupid death. (Which is unfortunately very easy to accomplish.)
</li><li> There is a notable gameplay aspect to this tendency in DF. Even if you don't particularly care about a given entity in the game, <em>your dwarves do</em>. If your dwarf's pet or family member or close friend dies, they can get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">very upset</a></em>.
</li><li> All of which lead to some of the most creative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a> as the player tries to build the most inventively vicious deathtraps possible to turn goblin sieges into paste. Or even better, catch them all in cages and let your happy little dwarves use them for sparring practice. Especially once you've lost a few favorite dwarves to the goblins. When everything wants to kill your beloved dwarves, a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> savagery is in order, after all.
</li><li> No matter how long its owner has been dead, a war dog will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">always keep the title "pet of (name)"</a>.
</li><li> Companions in Adventurer Mode can inspire this as well.

</li></ul></li><li> Just try not to feel any affection for your fake spouse and child in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>. Even after every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent">Scripted Event</a> has been shown and there is nothing left to do, it is near impossible to stop playing thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>.
<ul><li> If you played any <em>Harvest Moon</em> game, it's a good bet that you have been in a panic about finding some random citizen's birthday, and saying a prayer that they like the Radish that you didn't sell specially to give to them! And let's not even mention your animals (Everyone else panicked and brought their dog in at the chance of rain, right?)
<ul><li> Sometimes, Videogame Caring Potential breeds itself, in that in some games your dog likes you more for holding it when you go to sleep. If you always let your pet sleep on your bed anyway, there's no chance of leaving it out in a storm in the first place.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Likewise the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em>. Players can befriend the townsfolk and help them with their personal issues, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">even if they are a farmer and not a therapist</a>. Notably, a lot of players opt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">"rescue" the more troubled romance choices</a> by marrying them and inviting them to come live on the farm; for example Penny (who happens to be one of the most popular female choices) lives with her abusive alcoholic mother in a dingey, stuffy little trailer by the river, and going to live on the farm alleviates the problem and gives the girl her own space.
</li><li> Also played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty">Majesty</a>: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim</em>. In an innovative, if sometimes frustrating twist, you do not have direct control over your troops; rather, you are the sovereign of the land, and you hire heroes and they wander about questing on their own. It's like a more interactive version of Progress Quest, really. With nifty sprite graphics. If you want something attacked, either wait for the hero to wander by it, which will cause other heroes to hear the sounds of battle and join in; build a guard tower close by to direct your free guardsmen there; or place a bounty on the object and they will attack until either they destroy the object (for example, the elven buildings in the abducted prince quest) or pick it up and bring it home (for example, the titular items in the "Bell, Book, and Candle" quest).
</li><li> In the iPhone game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketGod">Pocket God</a></em>, you control a small tribe on an island. You can kill them in various horrible ways (feeding them swordfish, drowning them etc), but you can also set the sky to sunset and the little looks of wonder on their faces is possibly the cutest thing ever. You can also light a fire, make it night-time, and watch them all curl up in a group to sleep like they didn't just spend all day getting attacked by dinosaurs and ice monsters.
</li><li> This is the major premise of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker">Princess Maker</a></em> games. And it <em>works</em>.
<ul><li> Heck, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a> was so damn proud of their adoptive brat by the end of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helps that she ended up becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Enfante Terrible</a> who not only commits regicide but ends up usurping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em> is both this <em>and</em> cruelty potential, depending on the kind of player you are.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AliceAndKev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AliceAndKev">Alice And Kev</a></em> is an example of just how powerful this can be in The Sims.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">creepypasta</a> actually shows this too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A ghost of a child who was abused in his life and died in a housefire uses the game as a second chance at life, and the player grants it to him upon seeing the state that he was in when he played the family.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em> balances this and cruelty potential just as the main series does. While you will die if you're too mean and don't complete necessary tasks, the amount you can do to care for your hero sims, their families and even the random civilians caters to this trope. The fact that murder, plague, alcoholism, political tension, etc mean that Sims can have worse problems than in the main games just makes you care for your kingdom more. Notable moments include finding a giant crab-man and <em>befriending it</em>, finding a lost child and freeing a genie.
</li></ul></li><li> Though not strictly a video game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a></em> is a brilliant demonstration of this principle. Think about it: It's a digital <em>voice simulator</em> built on samples of a voice actor or actress' donated data, each with a cute anime-style mascot character, but with no explicit personality. After you've listened to those characters sing, it's hard not to think of them as people and even have incredible loyalty to the programs you use the most.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em> can bring this up, seeing as it's basically a neighborhood simulator.

<ul><li> Uchi villagers, introduced in <em>New Leaf,</em> are the "big sister" types that care about you. They also can get excited if you decide to sell your furniture that the uchi villager wants. If you are at high happiness with that uchi villager, after you accept the offer, she will ask if it's really okay, and another option appears between the option to sell the furniture or decline the sell; the option to just give the furniture without obtaining the bells that were offered. Should you select it, the uchi villager will be at a loss for words, and as the animation of you giving the uchi villager your furniture finishes, the uchi villager will burst into tears and tell you that you are the best before thanking you, resulting in her being in a happy mood.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KerbalSpaceProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KerbalSpaceProgram">Kerbal Space Program</a></em> players often go to great lengths to protect (and/or rescue) their little green astronauts.

<ul><li> Each part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> series has a single moment where extra efforts aimed at saving people are more or less optional and are without material reward of any kind but are extremely compelling and self-satisfactory:
<ul><li> In the first game you return home after a hyperdrive test run only to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find your planet in flames and the Taiidan destroying the cryo trays with the last remnants of your race</span>. One of the trays is already damaged by the time you arrive, and unless you go extra mile and probably sacrifice some of your forces the invaders will destroy it before you can destroy them. There is no reprimand for that and no bonuses for saving the tray, but, goddammit, there are a hundred thousand people, <em>your people</em>, in it!
</li><li> In the semi-sequel, <em>Cataclysm</em>, you encounter a civilian convoy under attack by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">nanovirus delivery</a> missiles. Here efforts to protect the transports are more justified from the pragmatic point of view, since each converted transport starts launching missiles itself, and once the enemy runs out of clean transports it turns on you. Still you can't help but feel a moral obligation to protect as many transports as possible. Especially once you <em>hear</em> the screams of a ship's crew being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">"converted"</a> and realise just how many people are supposed to be in there...

Intercepting every rocket is a quite difficult as it must be done manually and you'll have to constantly switch between the tactical screen, where the rockets are visible, and the game screen, where all the fighting takes place, but these inconveniences are completely blotted out by a single thought: "Not a single rocket must reach the surface.

Your crew makes note of it before it turns away and warps out. You encounter the same ship later, guarding your objective, but again, with its shields down and making no effort to attack you. This is where you ought to slow down, take a breath, and think, "What Would Captain Picard Do?" Open hailing frequencies. The result is gaining a new ally and making the last level much easier (the alien ship will accompany you on your final run, and if he's with you then a big chunk of the enemy fleet will ignore you), your sector admiral giving you huge glowing praise, more detail about what's going on with the plot, and the satisfaction that Gene Roddenberry's view of the universe is still alive and well, even in an action game.

It's also caring to choose the more caring decisions such as letting enemies surrender, freeing slaves to join your crew, and one event has an Engi ship mistake you for a pirate and offers to transfer goods for it's survival.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> games, troops now get "Veteran" statuses etc. for defeating troops- making individual units theoretically more unique. This was done to discourage the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Infantry Spam</a> tactics from previous games. Unfortunately, with the boosts so meager for the unit's usual unlikeliness to survive for much longer, it doesn't work very well.
<ul><li> <em>Game Boy Wars 3</em>, on the other hand, has Materials in addition to the standard Gold for building units. The price gaps with Materials are much smaller in the game than the ones with money in other installments—and with the Gold price gaps being outright immense in <em>Game Boy Wars 3</em>, this does mean infantry spam is weakened, as replacing units is punished, and just repairing them could easily deny you better units. Good thing too, because enemy units are weakened when adjacent to multiple units.
<ul><li> As if the EXP system (which was also in Super Famicom Wars) wasn't enough, eh? Add unit promotion in GBW3 and there's plenty of reason to stay alive.
</li></ul></li><li> The latest <em>Advance Wars</em> also changed how the Technique-rating was calculated. Before, you could spam units towards the end of the game to make your survival look good, but that actually <em>lowers</em> it in the new one. Now, the best strategy is to let many of them live.
<ul><li> The method of calculating tries to anyway. Unfortunately, it fails spectacularly the way the formula is handled.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>None</em> of the above have anything on Arrangement in Campaign mode of <em>Game Boy Wars 3</em>. In Campaign, completing a map puts your surviving units in the reserves and then on a subsequent map, Arrangement will let you send out a unit, with its Experience retained, on an allowed property near your HQ, and you don't have to pay anything for it, just the property's liberty for the turn. You can even promote certain units before putting them out on the field if they are at S Rank. Obviously, the key to succeeding in Campaign would be to plan out your units so as to deal with any possible situation, and concentrate on keeping them alive.
</li><li> Andy from Advance Wars encourage this kind of gameplay, as his CO power and SCO power allows him to repair any damaged units up to five HP as well as upgrading them for a turn. You can take away your troops without much issue, since the SCOP will repair 50% of the unit heal, allowing them to figh another day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattalionWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattalionWars">Battalion Wars</a></em> does the same thing by making everything <em>adorable</em>. The first time you take control of a tank and a grunt quietly goes "Take good care of her, sir" may make you go "aww". The trouble starts when you realize that the opposing forces are just as cute, <em>and</em> they have accents.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris">Nectaris</a></em> gives units from 1-9 xp, they earn one for an attack, one extra for attacking with no losses, and of course each xp slightly boosts all combat-related stats. Much like Myth, however, you only get what you have, instead factories are for repairing units that aren't totally destroyed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em> turns this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to 11</a>. Not only can you recall units from previous scenarios in the campaign modes, but they also have <em>quasi-unique names</em> and randomized traits such as "Swift" and "Intelligent" which give them certain bonuses. There just <em>has</em> to be at least 1 guy out there who has mourned the death of a unit.
<ul><li> Helped by the fact that units can gain experience and level up not unlike RPG characters, which comes into play especially in campaign mode where they take that experience with them from one scenario to the next. A higher-level unit that you've <em>worked</em> to get to that point is naturally easier to feel invested in than just another random new recruit (while on the other hand any such new recruit has at least the potential to get to that point itself in turn...).
</li></ul></li><li> In all iterations <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> starting with III (including the console game <em>Revolutions</em>), the "Cultural Victory" path rewards you for building an enlightened Democracy with Cathedrals and Universities to contrast your cruel and warlike Communist neighbors. It makes you go all warm and fuzzy inside to see neighboring cities defect en masse and welcome those poor, oppressed people into your civilization.
<ul><li> Also your subjects will occasionally throw "We Love the King/Queen Day" celebrations in your honor, complete with fireworks. It's good to see them acknowledge how great you are
</li><li> In <em>Civilization II</em> (at least; might also be present in some of the others), "We Love the X Days" give celebrating cities some kind of bonus. Usually this is the resource-gathering potential of the next-best government form, but Republics and Democracies, as the top-tier govs, instead give the city in question an additional population point <em>every turn</em>. This effectively turned those two government forms into a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> for experienced players. Like they weren't already.
</li><li> Democratic-type governments in general are the "grow and make money like crazy" systems in all <em>Civilization</em>-type games.
<ul><li> In <em>II</em> and <em>III</em> they give a direct boost to the economy by boosting Trade/Commerce.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> (<em>Civilization</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE">in space</a>), Democratic Politics gives a boost to Growth and Efficiency, which you can combine with Knowledge Values and Cybernetic Future Society to achieve a Paradigm Economy (i.e. maximum Efficiency) with pretty much every faction (even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Peacekeeping</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">Forces</a>), meaning you can run a very large empire with <em>far</em> less money lost to corruption than under any other system, or combine with Planned Economics and Eudaimonic Future Society (which is basically Videogame Caring Potential in the form of a Social Engineering option) to get to a state of Population Boom (i.e. maximum Growth), which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. (The direct boost to income is provided by Free Market Economics.)
</li><li> In AC, you can build an enlightened democracy with peace and justice for all, cultivate your talent pool, adopt environmentalist economics and build Centauri Preserves.

</li><li> The downside to all of these, however, is that they all reduce your ability to support troops and make war. On the other hand, starting with <em>Civilization III</em>, you support your troops and make war by direct expenditure of money from the treasury. When you're turning a large surplus already, building a large army just makes your surplus smaller.
</li></ul></li><li> Early combat units that have accrued a ton of combat veterancy may apply for this. The unruly band of warriors you start off with may go on to fight dozens of battles, eventually going on to become some of the finest formations under your control, having fought for hundreds of years against your civilization's foes. (A land "unit" in <em>Civilization</em> is approximately equivalent to a division, or maybe a brigade or regiment depending on era and which iteration of the game we're talking about.)
</li><li> When you conquer a city that was itself conquered, you have the option in the later games of either incorporating it into your empire... or Liberating it, returning it to whoever initially owned it. If that player was already eliminated from the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">this even returns them to life.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">They'll probably be way behind everyone else,</a> and the resulting city is going to take a while to recover from being conquered twice, but they'll be loyal to you basically forever, and this undoes any warmongering penalties you might have picked up over the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dominions">Dominions</a> 3</em> has both named commanders and generic ordinary units, each represented by individual sprites on the battlefield. Watching enemy heavy cavalry ride down my troops (complete with individual screams), or seeing a veteran commander fall victim to assassination (or worse, disease, which causes them to lose 1 HP a turn until they die), made it -very- satisfying to utterly annihilate the enemy gods responsible.
<ul><li> This is exacerbated by the popular supercombatant strategy, where one goes through the process of summoning a select commander, loading them up with hand picked magical items, and sending them off to war. Seeing these guys on the receiving end of a well made trap is just depressing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar">EndWar</a></em>, you are given a persistent battalion that you upgrade and improve, with unique callsigns, consistent voices in response to your orders (including sounds of abject panic that convey the fact that they're getting ripped apart much better than the dispassionate voice of your XO saying they're getting hammered), and carried over experience... <em>if</em> they stay alive. While a defeated unit will be evacuated if possible, it's still possible for an enemy to kill them entirely. It eventually hits the point where you can get paranoid about using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">WMDs</a> for fear that the enemy will kill your units with a reprisal. It eventually becomes a fairly major point of Heartwarming when you hear them say they won't let you down, and worrying when they yell for evac or support, and an outright kick in the teeth when their unit card glows with the skull and crossbones that says that the unit is dead instead of evacuated.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em> series always penalizes you if you let too many of your hires die. If named characters lack a proper burial (say, you dumped the body in a river instead of securing the area in order to transport it out) then your reputation will plummet and only the will-work-for-anyone dregs will join you. For generic guards, if too many die it will be harder or more expensive to secure their replacements.
<ul><li> If you help the local villagers (instead of trying to use them as meat shields), your reputation in the town (which affects a town tax-rate stat) won't plummet.
</li><li> The actual voice clips of characters when they refuse to work for you, or when they're already working for you and think you're an asshole, just serves to ram it home for how big of a screw-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> you are. Now, in Jagged Alliance 2, hire Raven and her husband, Raider. Have one die. How big of a jerk are you? The survivor will let you know <em>all. The. Time.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> allows the player to protect young species and even <em>uplift</em> them (that is, give the technological knowledge for a species to <em>take to the stars</em>). Just hope there's no kinks in the process, and that the science teams don't pull a species-wide prank.
</li><li> <em>Medieval 2: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> encourages the player to be a jerk since gaining money is much easier when being evil. Being a chivalrous general has benefits since you gain a morale boost for your men when fighting the enemy which means they are less likely to rout, while dread bonuses for ruling towns have at times a negative effect on the population. Sadly, most people opt for the crueler option most of the time.
<ul><li> All <em>Total War</em> games have an experience mechanic for units, which encourages some players (those that don't just rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Human Wave</a> tactics) to try to keep their own armies' casualties to a minimum.
</li><li> This can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>. "Hmm, the enemy are making their last stand in the city center, but I don't want to lose any more men finishing them off..." So what do you do? Wheel a crude cannon into place and go bowling. Or, if you're taking a castle and the last enemy units are all cavalry, get your archers on the walls of the keep and just execute the helpless horsemen with direct-fire arrow volleys.
<ul><li> It is actually ill-advised to do so if you're settling down for a long war, something which is especially likely in the limited-nations expansions. A high command, high morale general, with high valour high morale peasants? Those spearmen and militias are about to get chewed.
</li></ul></li><li> You should care for your generals and Royal family in all Total War games because the more battles they win the better they become at war, the more likely they are to win if you auto-battle and of course the men are less likely to run from the battle. Oh and at least in Medieval if you lose (or kill your enemies) all your generals and family then you get a non-standard game over.
</li><li> The trait system in general can foster this trope, as it has the effect of making your generals and agents come across like real people.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a>: The Fallen Lords</em> and <em>Myth 2: Soulblighter</em> were some of the first strategy games to have veterans systems. The more kills a unit got the faster it would attack and the more damage it would deal. And since you don't start out with many units to begin with and are always outnumbered quite a bit, you do everything you can to make sure they stay alive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle">Ogre Battle</a></em> has several special characters that you can draw into your ranks as you move through the game. Some of them are likable characters and you can feel like crap for getting them killed. Even the generic characters make your heart wrench when they fall in battle. Although, this can be because you spent countless hours leveling them to reach a certain class and you hard work just died out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OriginalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OriginalWar">Original War</a></em> is built around this trope. Every human unit in the game is a unique individual with RPG-like stats, and when they die, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. It is often better to deploy inferior remote-controlled or computer-controlled vehicles just to avoid risking your precious soldiers. (Honestly this is a lot like the use of military robots in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.)
</li><li> Played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> clone/superior cousin <em>War Wind</em>, where veteran units may be kept until the next stage for a minor pre-game boost. You may even keep the 'epic' units with you, though most of the time you'll want something faster, or you'll want to bring an extra artisan for resource/build tier boosts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars">Halo Wars</a></em>, it is common to become attached to units with stars, to the extent of not actually using them for fear of their deaths. Especially your starting scout unit.
</li><li> Somewhat averted in CDV games, notably the Conquest series. Despite almost EVERY SINGLE UNIT having its own experience, morale, and even phobias! <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanConquest">American Conquest</a></em> is especially bad for this, as human wave tactics are pretty much the only way to take a fort due to the sheer number of defences. See, even though you have all these stats, non-hero units tend to take damage like the squishy pink fleshlings that they are... Just created or alive since the start of the battle, a few shots from a musket will ruin any militia or trapper's day. The damage indicator is more an indicator of how accurate their weapons are, as you may see if you watch the spot of the impact graphic closely. Bullet impacts seem to deal percents, not numerical, while high health only really helps in melee. Also, cannonballs can mow through troops ridiculously accurate for their time period. One of the largest reasons behind the human wave requirement is how deadly fort cannons can be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> EVERY character you control is named and has their own head-shot. Add to the mix a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> (minus restarting the game), specific endings for every character, and lots of character interaction, you wind up with players wanting to restart every level multiple times so that no one ever dies.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon</a></em> introduced a system whereupon the game will provide your army with generic units if your numbers get too low, and secret chapters only accessible if you have below certain numbers of units, finally providing players with the perfect opportunity to take the pain of resetting in earlier games out on their army... yet the overall tendency of players is still often to reset on every death.
<ul><li> The amount of self-inflicted butchery needed to hit the secret chapters is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">something that won't occur naturally to most players.</a> This is especially true for those who played the earlier games, and thus have been taught by experience that losing a unit is a bad, bad thing. In fact, most guides and FAQs for the game strongly urge you to do a separate play-through to see the secret chapters.
</li></ul></li><li> Games of the series that have a relationship system inspire this in additional ways; you will want your characters to live so that you can see through their own little story arcs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> takes this to a whole new level with the ability to marry off your party members and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">recruit their children, sent to the past through the time stream.</span> We need to emphasize this point: your characters are a <em>very</em> tightly-knit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>.

Let's review: All soldiers have their own names and inventories. The ability to loot gear off the dead means that a bit of effort makes soldiers much more effective. The ability to loot hats off the dead means personal touches. The AI is helpful beyond contemporary standards, e.g. when an enemy tank rounds a corner, a soldier throws an AP grenade, takes cover in the opposite direction, and tends his wounds. A lack of hand-holding means room for crazy plans. The option to switch to FPS controls for individual soldiers means opportunities for death-defying heroism. A fairly interactive environment means, for example, removing weapons from disabled tanks and adding them to the defensive lines, or some fool driving through a battlefield on a hijacked tractor, hauling machine guns and ammo. Playing the game means sending these people to die by the hundreds. Ladies and gentlemen, video games as a learning tool.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>: Your army is comprised entirely of recruits which are rather unique from one another, all of which are trained up by you to be powerful and fearless soldiers. It is not uncommon for even the largest player armies to have a troop that is the "odd one out", either by being a neutral faction troop that you rescued from another lord's captivity or the last survivor of a recruitment run you made while in another faction's borders. It is not uncommon for that specific soldier to survive months worth of fighting under your command only to be unceremoniously listed on the casualty report after a skirmish.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a>: Kingdoms</em> gives units bronze, silver, and gold ranks as they rack up kills.

So a player that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">spends the lives of his/her men like water</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> early on to take all the objectives will often still wind up losing to a more conservative player who only managed to hold onto one part of the map but kept all his units alive while defending it. Troops also function better with higher morale, encouraging you to keep them from getting too beat up. When you do find yourself having to sacrifice a unit for the sake of victory, it eats at your heart a little every time.
<ul><li> Not to mention that, in Campaign mode, when you lose a unit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">they're gone</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">For good</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Irreplacably</a>.

Each one is uniquely portrayed by a real actor and each has their own personality.

You play as a small city doctor who one day is visited by a wandering merchant whose life you had once saved who has come to repay his debt to you. He entrusts you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">small, horrifically abused former slave girl</a> called Sylvie whose former master (now deceased) used to torture her daily for fun, leaving her with grotesque acid burns all over her body.
