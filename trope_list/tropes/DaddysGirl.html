<ul><li> Usagi herself is <em>very</em> much a Daddy's Girl and one of the things about Mamoru she likes the most is that he <em>reminds</em> her of her father.
</li><li> ChibiUsa/Rini is a perfect example, monopolizing her future father Mamoru/Darian's time and fighting over him with her future mother Usagi/Serena. Her unfortunate transformation into Black Lady even twists her innocent need for approval and love for Mamoru into a vision of her kissing him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">first anime</a>) and her actually taking him hostage and kissing him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a>).

<ul><li> Theresia is a classic example, very docile to her father the Count and is blind to his atrocities as he keeps her trapped in a tower. Upon discovering that her father is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">a hideous slug monster</a>, Theresia is terrified of her father and is even more horrified when she discovers that he had eaten her mother. But when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodofEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodofEvil">Godhand</a> suggests that he sacrifice his daughter, he is unable to do so, and thus gets sucked down the Abyss of souls. Theresia is heartbroken at the loss of her father and says she will make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Guts</a> pay for causing her such grief.
</li><li> Princess Charlotte is like this at first, but after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad">father</a> tries to rape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAcoma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAcoma">her while she's sleeping</a>, Charlotte becomes fearful of him and isn't too sad when he dies.
</li><li> Jill from the Lost Children's Arc is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion">subversion</a>, as her father is an abusive asshole who neglects to stop his gambling war buddies from molesting her. Jill then plays it straight with Guts who acts like a surrogate father, she even wraps his black cloak around herself like a blanket and later sleeps on his lap. Guts is also very protective of her, saving her from bandits, insect-fairy demons, and burning souls of children. He douses her with demon egg sac-juice when she catches fire. Though she ironically only feels safe around him Guts persuades her to leave him and fight her own battles, saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">his darkness</a> will swallow her.
</li><li> Scheirke is of the same mold. Although she admits she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on Guts, it becomes clear they have a more father-daughter relationship, with Guts punching the lights out of a drunk who ruined her dress. This also parallels Isidro who sees Guts as a father figure.

Having a bastard child in such a rigid, honor-bound tradition as the samurai caste is a big taboo, so Ryo understands what it means for a man of her father's station to acknowledge her as his own. She responds to his necessarily distant but very real affection by dedicating herself to training as a swordsman, so she might better follow and serve him. Other characters have mentioned how single-minded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Ryo's obsession</a> with defending Habaki and his reputation is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">with one character noting that such a complex relationship cannot end well</a>.

</li><li> Speaking of which Barbra Gordon aka Batgirl I, she pulls double duty as Daddys Girl to her beloved biological father Jim Gordon and to Batman as well.

Kitty tried to invoke this trope with Xavier so he let her back into the X-Men and by extension Colossus. Really out of the other X-girls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magik">Magik</a> specifically was closest to Xavier as a girl, enough to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug">Cool Down Hug</a> from him. Rogue plays this straight in later comics with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">thought bubbles</a> saying things like Do it for Charles which makes sense since Xavier was the one who willingly to accepted Rogue into the X-Men despite her villainous past with Mystique.
</li><li> Played with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Jubilee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Jubilee">Jubilee</a> as she is the most disrespectful towards Xavier and considered him "bald headed geek", Jubliee generally acts more like a Daddy's Girl with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> whom she adores. Though Jubilee does warm up to the "Prof" and is delighted when he gives her rollerblades as a present.

<ul><li> Played straighter in <em>House of X</em> with Wanda out of the picture, Mags treats Lorna like this as he likes having her by his side while teaching her.
</li></ul></li><li> The few times Magneto interacts with his granddaughter Luna makes it clear that they love each other — despite the fact that Luna is effectively a normal human just like the ones Magneto despises on principle. Luna's relationship with her father Quicksilver is about as far from this trope as it can get — Luna pretty much disowned him after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he lied about his culpability in his past crimes, claiming that a Skrull impersonated him.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> has a good case of this. The title character, Deadpool has a daughter with a fling, in the '70s. After her mom is killed, she's taken in by Deadpool's friend, Emily Preston, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who raises her as her own, and Deadpool feels she'd be safe there. He bought a house next door so he could keep an eye on her, and the two are very close. Ellie seems to be her father's biggest fan. Even before she knew he was her father, she thought of him fondly, saying that he was the one who destroyed the Zombie Presidents. Deadpool seems touched when she says this. She has a Deadpool action figure, drawn pictures on her wall of the 2 of them together, and wears Deadpool band-aids and shirts. Deadpool calls her is little "Dynamo-In-Training." Emily sometimes gets annoyed with Deadpool's influence on Ellie, such as watching horror movies with her. And Ellie's grandmother tells her to watch her language since she can swear like her father sometimes.
<ul><li> The Spider-Man/Deadpool series seems to show she spends the night at his place sometimes, where she has her own room. When she lives with the Prestons, she has to share a room with her step-brother.

Jean is shunned by her classmates because they're afraid of her inability to fully control her powers, and Xavier, who knows all too well the isolation that telepathy can bring, is her steadfast provider of emotional support. She thus falls under "The third possible character is the socially awkward one who gets understanding and encouragement from her father" category. Before Scott's arrival, Charles is the only person at the school whom Jean feels close to, and Xavier is more attentive towards her compared to the other young mutants under his care, which parallels how he had favoured Hank over the other teenage recruits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em> because he and McCoy shared more in common.

We're initially led to believe that Campbell was an archetypal father's daughter military brat who emulated his choice of a career in the army because she looked up to him. She was a Daddy's Girl originally (though General Campbell wasn't above using his daughter for PR purposes), but as Brenner and Sunhill discover, they viciously hated each other and evolved into mortal enemies because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of what happened at West Point, where he covered up her gang rape to save West Point's reputation and secure his own advancement.</span>

In turn, Scott cherishes his daughter and she motivates him to turn his life around and when she's in danger he willingly traps himself in the subatomic realm to save her.
</li><li> In many ways Maria Hill is this to Nick Fury <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">despite no blood relation</a> she never stops being loyal to him as Tony Stark notes and she is tearful upon his supposed death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>.

Then Odin turned over a new leaf and imprisoned Hela for her tyranny and strove to raise Thor and Loki better, <em>yes that's right he favors Loki over Hela</em></span>.

This best seen when Gamora believes she just stabbed Thanos in the neck, she bursts into tears as he calls her "My daughter" in his dying gasps then Thanos reveals the deceit. While there is mutual care, Thanos is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">an awful father</a> as he emotionally manipulates Gamora and preys off her vulnerabilities, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and is willingly (albeit regretfully) to kill her</span>.

Also the 2014 versions of Thanos and Gamora notably treated each other better due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> altering the course of history</span>.

</li><li> Sam, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ACinderellaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ACinderellaStory">A Cinderella Story</a></em> is an example of the tomboyish variation, complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishName">Tomboyish Name</a>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> on top.

</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LadyBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LadyBird">Lady Bird</a></em> is far closer to her father, as she frequently clashes with her mother's very domineering, critical personality.

He's also the one who taught her how to hunt, and he got her a new pair of shoes for her birthday every year, a gift India clearly likes and appreciates a lot. A lot of the tension between India and her mother stems from the fact that India doesn't think her mother is mourning him appropriately.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightWomen">8 Women</a></em>: The younger daughter Catherine and her father Marcel have a very close relationship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A rather dark example, as Catherine's attachment to him leads her to hatch a scheme with him involving faking his murder to expose the awfulness of the other seven women and show him that she's the only one he can rely on. It backfires on her though, as he kills himself at the end out of despair at the revelations.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ListenToYourHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ListenToYourHeart">Listen to Your Heart</a></em>: Ariana was very close to her father, who died when she was young.

It's a double-edged sword, because while Noah would do absolutely anything to protect her, he is also not above lying, manipulating, and treating her like a far younger child. Although, he's often revealed to be right about whatever point he's trying to make. And Claire has this whole love/hate relationship with Noah - she loves him, she hates him, she knows he's right but thinks she's right, she'll never trust him again, he's her father, he's the devil, lather rinse repeat - that can wound him like nothing and no one else.
</li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies">doubled</a> for Claire with her birth father, Nathan Petrelli, being a second father to her, particularly in Volume 4, when she is reconnected with the Petrelli side of her family. This results in Claire having two protective fathers, Noah and Nathan, who do their best to shield her (zigzagged as their protectiveness tends to strain Claire's relationships with both her dads).

Though Henry adores Mary and dotes on her during her early childhood, he sends Mary away to her own estate when he divorces her mother, Catherine of Aragon, and marries Anne Boleyn (leading to some guilt-ridden, intense scenes on the rare occasion Henry sees his estranged daughter during this period). When Mary, a devout Catholic, refuses to recognize her father as head of the church, Henry forces her hand with an indirect threat of execution. As soon as Mary relents, Henry welcomes her back with open arms and restores her status as a princess.

Realizing that his daughter is a tomboy who doesn't like the fact that she's being brought up to become a "proper" courtly lady, Eddard eventually allows her to be instructed by a fencing teacher. By contrast, Arya doesn't seem to take after Catelyn at all in looks or personality and is never seen interacting with her directly.
</li><li> Sansa Stark is less so than her sister Arya, but the scenes with the doll her father gives her heavily imply she is his darling girl, though she's clearly closer to Cat than Arya was.
</li><li> There's little lady Shireen Baratheon — her first response to seeing Stannis after a while is to squeal and hug him. Stannis, for his part, tries to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parent</a> to Shireen, but he doesn't often have time to spend with her.

It can be assumed she has a similar relationship to him as Arya has to her father, as Brienne clearly does not commit to socially expected female behavior and seems to have been brought up as a warrior in accordance with her own wishes.

And of course Jack Fenton who has shown several scenes of adoration to his daughter (not that he ignores his son), so much to the point that Jazz's often obsessive personality may have been caused by Jack's influence—no matter how much she would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">deny it</a>.
</li><li> Gosalyn has shades of this regarding her adoptive father, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em>. He's not quite as eager for her to follow in the family business. Notably, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">tomboy</a> traits predate her meeting him; this was greatly appreciated when she was Grandpa's Little Girl.
</li><li> Belinda, the mayor's daughter, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EllaTheElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EllaTheElephant">Ella the Elephant</a></em>. She constantly mentions her father to the other characters, dotes on him, and is also fond of reminding the other characters that he's the mayor.
</li></ul><ul><li> Pistol on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> just loves her daddy, Pete, mainly because he's willing to spoil her a lot of the time and lets her get away with bratty behavior her mother doesn't tolerate.
</li><li> Mabel's relationship with her great-uncle Stan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> resembles this trope. Stan is gruff at first, but as the series progresses it becomes increasingly clear that she has him wrapped around her little finger.
</li><li> Bizarrely enough, the otherwise utterly unloving <em>Gaz</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZIM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZIM">Invader ZIM</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople">One day a year</a>, she gets to hang out with her distant father, and she's <em>not</em> going to let Dib's alien-chasing obsession ruin that. For his part, Membrane is a lot closer to Gaz than he is to his "poor, insane son".
<div class="indent"> <strong>Membrane:</strong> Sorry about imprisoning you and turning you into a media freak, honey! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">It was in the name of science</a> and...hey, where's your brother?

<ul><li> Clash is shown to be a huge Daddy's Girl. To quote her, her dad adores her. Pizzazz has an extremely rocky relationship with her father and is perplexed by the idea a father could adore his daughter.
</li><li> While Jerrica and the others were close to their dad, Kimber was the closest and she is most scarred by his death as shown in "Father's Day". She becomes depressed and bitter on the first Father's Day after his death. When she shows up to a Father's Day banquet arm-in-arm with Pizzazz's father that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">makes Pizzazz more furious than almost anything else in the series</a> (which is saying something because she's frequently mad)...
</li><li> Ba Nee was obsessed with finding her presumably dead father that she never met. In the series finale, she's reunited with him and becomes one of these properly.
</li><li> Pizzazz is an odd case in that she's a daddy's girl but also has a sour relationship with her father. He was hands-off and unaffectionate to her growing up and as adults, he is still distant, but Pizzazz is always trying to get his attention.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>.
<ul><li> Diamond Tiara is one of only two fillies paying attention to her dad's presentation during "Family Appreciation Day". Indeed, she hangs on his every word with an adoring look on her face.
</li><li> Plaid Stripes. Her father basically forces Rarity to hire her, and when Applejack turns down her idea of "spoon clothes," she goes right to him, and he wastes no time giving Applejack an earful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vanessa to Doofenshmirtz. Their father-daughter relationship is somewhat strained, Doof being an incredibly embarrassing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a> who's divorced from Vanessa's mom, but she clearly cares a whole lot about him. Doofenshmirtz goes to crazy lengths to make his daughter happy, even if he's wrong about what would make her happy. The one slam dunk he made was finding a Mary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> doll for years after Vanessa had given up looking for one and she was so happy she sang a song about how he's "Not so bad a dad after all."
</li><li> There are a handful of episodes that suggest that Candace has this relationship with her stepfather, Lawrence. They enter a father-daughter contest together and he teaches her to drive, among other situations. Unlike her mom, he doesn't think Candace is crazy and is actually aware of Phineas and Ferb's antics. He doesn't stop them, but she loves him anyway.

The trope name is her phone's password and when we finally meet her father, they're shown to have been very close since she was a child.
</li><li> Beth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> is this for the most part. She adores her father most of the time but isn't above calling him out if she needs to. Since he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">gone most of her life</a>, she is willing to put up with his antics because she is afraid of him running out on her again. She also allows her children to go on potentially dangerous adventures with him across the universe, partially due to the fact that she would rather her kids end up like him rather than their own father.
</li><li> Though both her parents love her, Angelica Pickles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> appears to be closer to her father, Drew, possibly because he's around her more often than her mother, Charlotte.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2s4d4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2s4d4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2s4d4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is especially prominent throughout the first season and the first half of the second season, as Charlotte didn't appear on the show until "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RugratsS2E14TheSantaExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RugratsS2E14TheSantaExperience">The Santa Experience</a>" midway through the second season.</span> Drew is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PushoverParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PushoverParents">more of a softy when it comes to his attempts at disciplining his daughter</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lisa. While her father is a complete idiot and often manages to embarrass her, she still loves him no matter what. Examples: In "Lisa's Wedding", she stops her own wedding because her British fiance was disgusted with her family (that, and he wasn't wearing her father's cufflinks. Which look like pigs.). Homer even - not once, <em>twice</em> - sacrificed buying an air conditioner for his family to buy Lisa a new saxophone. <em>And</em> he sold his ride on the Duff Blimp to enter her in a beauty pageant when she was suffering from a lack of self-esteem. Several times, she comes to realize this and loves him back. The current page picture is from the ending of "Lisa's Wedding" when she reunited with him.
</li><li> Maggie. In fact, her first (and thus far only, not counting non-canon episodes) spoken word throughout the series was "daddy". "And Maggie Makes Three" was very sweet when Homer was worried about having a third baby in the family, but the minute he saw her, she won his heart. Even more so since Maggie's been the only one who called him "daddy" as a baby instead of "Homer".
</li><li> And let us not forget Maggie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> saving Homer's life by sniping Fat Tony and the rest of his crew when they came to whack him </span> in "Poppa's Got A Brand New Badge".
