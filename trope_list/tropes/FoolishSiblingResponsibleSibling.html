Enter the Foolish Sibling and the Responsible Sibling.
</p><p>In this trope there will be one sibling who is foolish, usually acting melodramatically and prone to doing irresponsible and impulsive things. They may be louder, more outgoing and usually more popular (or at least <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">try</a></em> to be), and desiring attention, especially from the opposite sex. Usually, they don't have outright bad intentions, they just don't understand that anything they do can have consequences for themselves or other people. Alternatively, they may just be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a> and get involved with the wrong people on a regular basis; they refuse to believe their "friends" could be anything but pure of heart, despite obvious evidence to the contrary. Their antics will be their undoing, getting them into trouble for which there is no one but themselves to blame. The Foolish Sibling may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter">Bratty Teenage Daughter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale">Fille Fatale</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildishOlderSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildishOlderSibling">Childish Older Sibling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NEET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NEET">NEET</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">The Ingenue</a>.

They're often more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">parental figure</a> in the other sibling's life, even if their actual parents are still present. They might be quieter or plainer, though usually they are only quiet or plain by comparison to their obnoxious other sibling, and doesn't qualify as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a> at all. They're almost undoubtedly smarter though and may be portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bookworm">Bookworm</a>, or just very concerned about rules, social and moral. Generally, the responsible sibling will try to steer their foolish sibling to the right path, taking it on themselves to look after the kid and make attempts to curb the other sibling's behavior. This seldom works, however, at least not until the end, when the foolish sibling gets their comeuppance or realizes the error of their ways.

The responsible sibling is the one who will submit to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>, which may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a> and is generally happier than the foolish love match of the foolish sibling.

Usually involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about the right way to act, that is to say, be more like the responsible sibling and not the foolish sibling (although the responsible sibling may learn a lesson about "loosening up" and "having fun"). And while the responsible sibling is usually the elder of the two, the roles can be switched, with the younger sibling being the responsible one. Another possibility is a middle child being the responsible one to his or her older and younger siblings.

It's flamboyant, chatty and seemingly carefree Lante who takes responsibility when the serious, quiet Dante acts on an impulse and goes off the hook, sometimes even attacking people at random.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em>, the Kinohata sisters Mira and Misa follow this dynamic. Mira is an energetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> who is known to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">not particularly intelligent</a>, while Misa is a composed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> reputation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em> has the Nanami sisters, Touko and Mio. At the time of Mio's death, Mio was a highly respected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, while Touko was a shy girl with mediocre grades and few friends, making them come off as a downplayed version. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, it's the opposite. While Touko strived to improve herself and eventually achieved all the success Mio had, she learned that Mio was a slacker who delegated most of the work to her fellow student council members, including having them do her summer homework.</span>
</li><li> Rowdy, underachieving delinquent Romio and strict, no-nonsense prefect Airu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet">Boarding School Juliet</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, Daichi's uncle Kengo is the responsible sibling while Daichi's father is the foolish one. The latter disappeared, leaving his young children to fend for themselves, while the former is a businessman who employs Daichi and offered to take in the four kids.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, Yukimura is the foolish sibling to Nobuyuki's responsible one, as Nobuyuki is very orthodox and straightforward, while Yukimura is the lazy, playful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>, there's the Kurobane sisters. Misa, the eldest sister, was the Foolish sibling, since her reckless thrill-seeking ways got herself killed, and she remembers causing problems for her parents. Yusa, the younger sister, is the Responsible, being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> who's far nicer and more level-headed, causing Misa to say that Yusa was quite unlike her in that regard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em>: Goten is nice, but carefree and naive, while his older brother Gohan is intelligent and responsible. Justified by the age gap between them and Gohan's murderous childhood before Goten was born.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>: Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em>, where Judau is usually seen skipping school and doing things with his friends while his younger sister Leina is bugging him to get an education. However, it's actually reversed: the things Judau is doing with his friends is hard work in the junkyard, and he skips school to keep up this job so that he can save enough money for Leina to get a good education. Leina tends to ignore this and focus on the present, while Judau's thinking long-term.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EbisuSanAndHoteiSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EbisuSanAndHoteiSan">Ebisu-san and Hotei-san</a></em> has the two Ebisu sisters, the younger of which is half of the eponymous couple. The elder sister is the foolish one, being quite lazy when it comes to cleaning and even forcing Mayo to take care of Hana. The younger sister, on the other hand, is responsible, being a highly efficient worker who balances her job with caring for her niece.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kagome isn't flighty per se, but often forgets to bring her homework to class, only for Sota to pick up the slack. Then again, considering she's spending most of her time in the Feudal Era, she can hardly be blamed for losing focus on her supposed off days.
</li><li> The titular Inuyasha and Sesshomaru also exhibit this. While Inuyasha is brash, crude, and free of responsibilities, Sesshomaru is calculating and elegant.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItsToughBeingNeeko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItsToughBeingNeeko">It's Tough Being Neeko</a></em>, there's the Niito sisters. Nemuko, aka Neeko, is the Foolish sibling, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NEET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NEET">NEET</a> with crippling social anxiety. Her much younger sister Imoko is a high schooler who's willing and able to work part time having gotten a job at a place that rejected Neeko.
</li><li> Yui and Ui from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> epitomize this trope. While Yui tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">irresponsible at best</a>, Ui cooks, cleans house, and even helps her older sister with her homework.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em> has the responsible Tiff and the foolish Tuff. Tiff is quite intelligent, while Tuff is not too bright and tends to act before thinking.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp">Laid-Back Camp</a></em>, Nadeshiko is an energetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditz</a>, while her sister Sakura is a taciturn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, Kagami is studious and level-headed while Tsukasa is more naive and childish.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaReflection">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection</a></em>, where Kyrie's inability to be like her more level-headed and responsible older sister Amitie causes her to develop an inferiority complex <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and leaves her open to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend">Iris'</a> manipulations</span>.

<ul><li> People expected the First and Second Hokage to be serious, loyal, responsible people. Only the younger fits this description on a normal day. His older brother instead thinks it's a good idea to teach a toddler how to gamble. Yes, the First was responsible for Tsunade's gambling addiction.

</li><li> Sakon and Ukon fit, Ukon's favorite phrase even being "wise older brother, foolish younger brother." Ukon seemed to be the more pragmatic of the two, while Sakon was more sadistic in liking to drag things out.
</li><li> Kinkaku and Ginkaku, for what little panel time they had, may fit as well. They are half-siblings or fraternal twins. Kinkaku is bigger and seems to be the more observant and pragmatic one in battle. He's also rather stoic in the manga. Ginkaku is the louder of the two, and more prone to smirking and losing his cool. He's the one that ends up being taken down first, and according to Kakuzu, it's not the first time, since Kinkaku is known to rage when it happens.

At the start of the story, Anna is the Foolish sibling, being a sheltered princess who is willing to marry Prince Hans, a man she's only just met, while Elsa is the Responsible future queen. This sort of dynamic is explored in the "A Sister More Like Me" picture book, which also shows the sisters accepting each other's differences.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> has a good number of these duos.
<ul><li> <em>Welcome To Dead House</em>: Amanda is the much more patient and sensible sibling while her brother, Josh is the impatient, bratty one who's extremely stubborn.
</li><li> <em>One Day At Horrorland</em>: Lizzie states that she's the calm one of the family while her brother, Luke, is the hyperactive sibling who enjoys pinching people.
</li><li> <em>Deep Trouble</em>: Billy's the one with the overactive imagination to his sister Sheena's more serious, non-imaginative demeanor.
</li><li> <em>Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes</em>: Joe is the one who often jokes around, whereas his sister, Mindy, is much more organized to a point where she suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Curse of Camp Cold Lake</em>: Sarah Maas, the protagonist, is the socially awkward girl who has meltdowns over minuscule problems such as a bunk under an open window to her younger brother Aaron, who is much more social and level-headed.
</li><li> <em>Night of the Living Dummy II</em>: A rare moment in which the protagonist isn't one of these. Sara, the older sister, is the responsible one, as she takes her talent as an artist very seriously, while Jed, the younger brother, is an obnoxious jerk who often shares practical jokes in Family Sharing Night. Amy, the protagonist and middle child, is in-between, as while she doesn't do as well in academic studies as her sister and even lazes around from her own schoolwork, she isn't nearly as much of a goof-off as her brother at the same time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma">Emma</a></em>: Downplayed. Sisters Emma and Isabella are caring individuals dedicated to helping their loved ones, and so both are Responsible in that regard. However, although she's still a loving mother and adoring wife, Isabella is not as clever and capable as Emma. Emma has her own failings, but despite her inability to successfully matchmake, she is - as Mr Knightley observes - much more clever and level-headed than her anxious, hypochondriac sister Isabella. Emma is the mistress of her father's house and has been taking care of everything with ease since she was <em>twelve</em>, making her the overall more responsible one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark">Mansfield Park</a></em>: Tom is the eldest son and Sir Thomas' heir, but he's very irresponsible and reckless — for example, he's lost some considerable fortune to gambling. The younger son Edmund is very responsible and reasonable, and would be in fact an ideal master of the estate; he chooses to become a clergyman. Tom gets seriously ill as a result of his life and he's determined to be better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Persuasion</a></em>: Anne Elliot is the Responsible Sibling, kind and intelligent, while her younger sister Mary is always whining, playing sick, and generally very unreasonable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>: The younger sisters, Kitty and especially Lydia, are the Foolish sisters, while Jane and Elizabeth are the Responsible sisters. Spoofing this trope is Mary Bennet, the middle sister, who <em>thinks</em> herself Responsible; it's true that she improves her mind with much reading and practices pianoforte, but she lacks genuine wisdom or even compassion, making a fool of herself in the meantime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em> has three pairs:
<ul><li> Responsible Elinor and foolish Marianne, albeit the "foolish" daughter is portrayed fairly sympathetically. It's even reflected in the title (when you realize that "sensibility" meant to Austen something like what "sensitivity" means in modern-day English). Elinor is reliable and calm, while Marianne is overly romantic and exaggerates her feelings.
</li><li> Lucy Steele may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>, but she's a clever, focused social climber who knows how to keep a secret. Her older sister Anne is an airhead.
</li><li> Edward Ferrars is sensible, well-mannered, and well-educated. His brother Robert is a self-absorbed fop.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>: The stories of Cain and Abel and Jacob and Esau, in the Old Testament; Jesus relates the story of the Prodigal Son to illustrate the difficulties of forgiveness.
<ul><li> The examples of Cain and Abel, and Jacob and Esau, are complicated in that in both cases, Esau and Cain are both presented as hard-working sons, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and not spiritually inclined. Cain and Abel work equally hard, but Abel's gifts happen to please God more, which makes Cain jealous. Jacob actually <em>tricks</em> his way into getting his father's inheritance (helped by his mother), but God blesses him and his line anyway. This might be a theme in the Bible — sometimes, God's grace just can't be accounted for by personal virtue.
</li><li> In the parable of the Prodigal Son, the younger son asks for his inheritance all at once, and promptly leaves home and has a rousing good time. It's only when he's destitute and ruined that he thinks to come home, and beg for work, if nothing else, on his father's land. His father welcomes him back with feasting and praise. However, the older, Responsible sibling is understandably upset — he's worked hard for years and has never received this kind of recognition. The father says that the eldest son has always been beloved, and could always ask for anything; but now that the prodigal son has returned, he will be welcomed as if he were back from the dead.
</li><li> Martha and Mary from the Gospel of Luke; Jesus arrives at their home and Martha busies herself preparing everything for him while Mary sits at Jesus' feet and listens to his teaching. Martha asks Jesus to have Mary come help her, but Jesus calmly rebuffs her by saying that Martha is worrying over small things while Mary is eager to listen to the word of God, thus being the more responsible of the two.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">lucky</a>, silly Odelia and the more conflicted, struggling-with-responsibility Ren. At some point they are noted to be suffering from the same old trauma inflicted by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">now-dead husband Keifer</a>, and each surviving sister has reacted in a different way, all of them somewhere along these lines.
</li><li> Thomas Mann's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Buddenbrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Buddenbrooks">Buddenbrooks</a></em> contains a deconstruction: Thomas is a responsible businessman and an important personage in the community, while his brother Christian is a wastrel who spends his money on drink, women and the theatre. Subverted in that Tom secretly finds his life empty and unfulfilling, while Christian is content with his life regardless of his diminished position in society (though not so much with Tom's treatment of him).
</li><li> Throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caraval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caraval">Caraval</a></em>, Scarlett is always cautious and nervous about doing anything reckless, while her younger sister Tella is more impulsive.

Her older sister Megan is a lot more sensible and down-to-earth.
</li><li> Lancelot and Percival Fortescue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye">A Pocket Full of Rye</a></em>. In Lance's words: "I blew my pocket money, he saved his. I had disreputable but entertaining friends, Percy made what he called 'worthwhile contacts.'"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">After the Funeral</a></em> gives us Richard Abernathie, a responsible businessman who raised his younger siblings, at least as compared to his brother Timothy (a self-absorbed hypochondriac) and his sister Cora (a 50-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>). There were also four other siblings, but they were dead before the story started and aren't described enough to know how they fit into this trope.

However, Ali is completely unprepared for court life, while Muntadhir reveals himself to be much more clever and serious about his responsibilities than he lets on.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad">Witches Abroad</a></em> we discover that Granny Weatherwax wanted to be the irresponsible evil one; but because her elder sister, Lilly, beat her to the punch on that, she felt forced to be the responsible good one. When both sisters are witches, you can see how this complicates family relationships.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>, Glenda and Juliet, who aren't actually sisters but grew up together, have this kind of relationship, with Glenda getting Juliet a job in the Night Kitchen, and then mostly having to do it for her. Subverted when Glenda realises a) that part of the reason Juliet isn't responsible is that Glenda never gave her a chance to be, and b) that maybe doing something that Glenda would consider very irresponsible is in fact a perfectly valid decision if you're the sort of person who wants to do something like that.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, Erdrick is always worried about the consequences of the foolish things his brother Beckram tends to do. Erdrick himself is rather shy and likes reading.
</li></ul><ul><li> After they lost their parents six months before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em>, initially Tash and Zak were not this way. Tash withdrew from the world and didn't want to do anything. However, she saw that her brother was becoming a reckless, careless daredevil and felt she needed to be out there looking out for him. It's not to say that they always follow this trope, but Tash usually <em>is</em> the more thoughtful one. In <em>The Brain Spiders</em> Tash is so caught up in trying to be independent and an adult that she does foolish things, while her younger brother wants to be more careful; he's aware of this dynamics flip and complains about it.
</li><li> The whole entire concept of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoofusAndGallant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoofusAndGallant">Goofus and Gallant</a></em> is about two twin brothers, one who acts as the not-so-nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRoleModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRoleModel">Anti-Role Model</a> in a particular situation, and one who acts in the correct way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GunsOfTheDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GunsOfTheDawn">Guns of the Dawn</a></em>, the Marshwic family has Mary and Emily, who tend towards the serious, and Alice, who is interested in balls and dresses despite the family not really having the money to support that kind of lifestyle anymore. It's played with a bit, though, in that Alice's determination to lead a properly aristocratic social life is revealed to be partly motivated by her belief that a good marriage is the only way to alleviate the financial troubles that keep the others so glum. On the other hand, her good motivations don't make her any smarter, as proven when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">runs away to meet someone who turns out to be a ransom-seeking outlaw</span>.
</li><li> Played with, and ultimately deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Everyone in the Wizard world thinks that the highly-accomplished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> Albus Dumbledore is the Responsible Sibling while his younger brother Aberforth — a bartender who "practiced inappropriate charms on a goat" — is the Foolish Sibling. But in their youth, as we learn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, it was a different story. Albus was intensely aware of his genius and his great potential, and bitterly resented having to take care of his brother and their mentally ill sister. Aberforth, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> but down-to-earth, wanted to ditch his formal education and care for Ariana, but Albus put his foot down, certain that he knew what was best. In other words, the traits that made Albus such a force for good in the world as an adult did him and those around him great harm in his youth. Albus himself believes Aberforth is the better man, calling him "my rough, unlettered, and far more admirable brother."
</li><li> Zigzagged with the Weasley siblings. During the first three books, Percy tries to act as the Responsible Sibling, doing his best to look after Ron and Ginny (and to a lesser extent, for Harry), while also <em>trying</em> to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterTwins">Fred and George</a> in line. The twins might come off as the Foolish ones given that they're always planning mischief and getting into trouble, but after Percy graduates and starts working for the Ministry of Magic, he lets his ambitions get to his head, to the point that it blinds him to how corrupt the ministry actually is, and he breaks his ties with his family after having a fight with their father, while Fred and George firmly stand by them. (Percy returns to the family three years later though.)
</li></ul></li><li> Kyle and Ian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost">The Host</a></em>. Maggie and Jeb are a subversion in that Maggie comes across as rather level-headed while Jeb comes across as somewhat crazy yet Maggie is the foolish one as she lets pride and stubbornness rule out basic logic while Jeb is the responsible one who views things from all angles and is quick on his feet.

She joined the army on a whim because she'd made too many enemies among the women of her tribe and figured she could just desert or sleep her way up should she get bored. Sinter, on the other hand, is the reliable and practical one with a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> as far as Kisswhere is concerned. She followed Kisswhere to the army so she could make sure her sister would not get herself into trouble. Her entire life consists of cleaning up after Kisswhere and she admits to chafing under that yoke.
</li><li> A dark example in Oyinkan Braithwaite's <em>My Sister the Serial Killer</em>. Ayoola, the younger sister, is featherheaded and impulsive, trusting her good looks and magnetic personality to get her out of everything—including, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">as you may have guessed from the title</a>, murdering all her boyfriends. Where those fail, protagonist Korede, the dutiful, practical older sister, whose job as a nurse taught her everything about how to clean up blood, comes in. Korede spends the whole book literally cleaning up after Ayoola, reminding her not to post perky Insta stories when she's supposed to be in mourning, and quietly seething over their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle">Sibling Triangle</a> with a gorgeous doctor.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> discussed a version of the Greek myth of Prometheus ("forethought") in which his foolish, absent-minded brother Epimetheus ("afterthought") completely bolloxed everything when the two brothers were given the job of creating humans and animals. With humanity almost ruined by Epimetheus, Prometheus had to steal fire and give it to humans to prevent our extinction. From Hesiod comes the story that Epimetheus enthusiastically received Pandora from the gods, despite all of Prometheus's warnings that she would be a blight upon humanity. He was right, she was.

Jimmy's efforts to become responsible and earn his brother's respect are a major source of motivation for him in the early seasons. A major source of conflict in the show comes from the fact that Chuck always resented Jimmy for being their parents' favorite despite all the trouble Jimmy got into and cannot accept that Jimmy is becoming a respectable lawyer so he sabotages Jimmy at every turn. At the same time, Chuck's mental illness is turning him into the Foolish one while Jimmy is forced to become the Responsible one trying to take care of Chuck.

Her younger sister, Kim, is the Foolish sister, being a veritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> who has seemingly no impulse control whatsoever, doing and saying whatever she wants, whenever she wants, not caring about the consequences that will result or the effects her actions have on others, even her sister. This takes on a darker than usual cast in two ways. Firstly, her behavior also leads to her engaging in rampant substance abuse and to be devoted to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend">Bastard Boyfriend</a>. Secondly, Kim resents her sister for being more successful and respected than her (although, ironically, their mother is more like Kim and definitely favors Kim), which she considers as fair rationale for exploiting and manipulating her sister. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She sets Amanda up to murder her abusive boyfriend for her when she gets sick of him, an act that would also result in a big insurance payout — which she forged Amanda's name to qualify for, and when she is caught on video-tape confessing with this, she skips town along with all of her sister's possessions  <strong>literally</strong>: the only things Amanda has left is her fridge, an ice tray, and Kim's goodbye note.</span> In later seasons, Kim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and finally gets proper treatment</span>, leading her to finally settle down and become more responsible.
</li><li> Similarly, Olivia and her half-brother Simon. Unlike Kim, Simon generally means well, but he's immature and impulsive to the point of reckless, enough to have gotten him in trouble with the law more than once.

</li><li> Fin's son Ken and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his half-brother Darius</span> are a particularly extreme version.

(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fans also speculate</a> that youngest daughter Elizabeth probably falls into the category of "responsible sibling" because they figure that if she <em>was</em> giving Elliot trouble, it would at least be mentioned and probably feature on the show at least once).

Richie is the foolish one and it leads to him being disowned by his own father for a very small screw-up (getting a few chocolate bars stolen). Al the ostensibly responsible one, has been actually conditioned to be subservient to his father and deludedly worship him which leads to Pop ruining his life even further.

Colt left the ranch to pursue (and screw up) a semi-pro football career, while Rooster stayed to work on the ranch. Beau, however, points out that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Man Children</a> who spend more time drinking and chasing women than they do working.

In the past, he often worried about his sister when she was off on her wild adventures and it fell to him to send her passports and colored contact lenses.

Rick was a blue-collar Vietnam veteran (Marine Corps, no less) who drank considerably and had unsavory friends. The younger brother A.J. was the white-collar half of the duo. He attended university during the Vietnam era and often scolded his brother. Rick was supposed to be streetwise, carefree and unflappable, while A.J. was straight-laced, anxious, and upwardly mobile, given to fretting about retaining his P.I.'s license.

It seems that Sam was given more freedom and innocence as a kid while Dean was forced to be his brother's caretaker and his dad's loyal soldier. However, Sam takes far more responsibility for his - and other people's - mistakes than Dean does. While Dean's sense of responsibility is mostly limited to his family, Sam's extends to the world in general.

"The Revelation" seems to imply that he realizes this dynamic exists and is trying to change it (by getting a job), but unfortunately he kind of screwed that one up.
</li><li> Katara notes that Kya and Bumi were the foolish siblings to the Tenzin's responsible sibling. Tenzin and his siblings argue - well into middle-age - about who was responsible and who wasn't.
</li><li> In season 3, we find out Lin has a half-sister named Suyin. As teens, Lin was the responsible one, becoming a cop like her mom, and Suyin was the foolish, skipping school and hanging out with gangsters. She's calmed down since then—starting her own family and even founding a city—but is still laidback compared to Lin.

Big Macintosh doesn't fit into this scheme, although in "Applebuck Season" he serves as the Responsible Sibling <em>to</em> the Responsible Sibling.
