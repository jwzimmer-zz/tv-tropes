</p><p>This trope is about fiction highlighting the unpleasant side of losing one's parents to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest">death</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">abandonment</a>. The parents have been lost recently, and the main plot (or at least a major subplot) involves dealing with this loss. This generally includes some combination of:
</p><ul><li> Grieving over the loss.
</li><li> Finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">surrogate parents or family</a>, whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">blood relatives</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. Complications may arise from finding a new family (perhaps involving a stay at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a> or under an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllegalGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllegalGuardian">Illegal Guardian</a>), or from fitting in with the new family. Expect the kid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">refer to the new parents by their first name</a>, rather than Mom or Dad, for some time.
</li><li> Discovering some heretofore-unknown aspect of the parents' lives, and investigating it. This attempt to understand their roots can be a subtle (or not) metaphor for the search for self-understanding.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> In particularly idealistic series, the parents may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">unintentionally missing, rather than dead</a>, and the plot would involve finding or rescuing them.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion">3-gatsu no Lion</a></em>, Rei's dealt with a lot since his family's death. At their funeral, most of his remaining blood relatives were none too concerned about him, with one even promising to send him to a "nice" orphanage. His foster care was built upon a lie on how much he liked shogi, and even when he was taken in, there was friction between him and the real children in the family as he surpassed them in shogi and fell into the most favor with their father. These problems never really went away until he pushed himself forward into the professional shogi circuit and left home early to live on his own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Orphans are extremely common, with many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">joining the military</a> to survive. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are all orphaned during the fall of Wall Maria, being among the <em>many</em> refugee children left without families. Later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Connie</span> is left orphaned when his village is destroyed. Discovering the secrets of his father's research is one of Eren's driving goals, and a major plot point of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BalancingMySupportMagicAndSummoningMagicInADifferentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BalancingMySupportMagicAndSummoningMagicInADifferentWorld">Balancing My Support Magic And Summoning Magic In A Different World</a></em>, two of the main characters, Arisu and Tamaki, are orphans, but rather than being adopted into loving homes from the orphanage, are taken in by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> who treat them like shit and give them serious complexes, due to the trauma of severe emotional abuse over the tiniest slight, real or imagined.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BarefootGen">Barefoot Gen</a></em>: many, many children were made homeless orphans by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>:
<ul><li> Although most of Rosette's history as an orphan is more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a>, in the manga it's revealed that one of the major points of Rosette's personality—her difficulty with being able to sit and wait—partially comes from the trauma of being able to do nothing but wait as the adults that knew her parents arranged their funeral and sent her and her brother to an orphanage.
</li><li> Joshua, Azmaria and Satella all show lingering affects of the deaths of their parents, as well. And, in fact, even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aion's issues stem partially from what happened to <em>his</em> mother</span>. This trope is really one of the biggest reasons why the characters in <em>Chrono Crusade</em> come off as such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Dysfunction Junction</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: Ed and Al. It all happens before the start of the actual story, but it still drives the plot: they begin their quest for the Philosopher's Stone after losing their bodies in an attempt to bring back their beloved mother, who'd raised them alone after their father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">left early on</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou">albeit with good reason</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They later find him, and the issues between them (namely, the reason he left) also drive most of the plot</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon">Full Moon</a></em>, not only is twelve-year-old Mitsuki an orphan, she has <em>terminal throat cancer</em>, a cold grandmother who doesn't let her do anything remotely fun, and later finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her first childhood love died in a car accident. Geesus!</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">poor Integra Hellsing</a>. Not only did she lose her mother years before, but the day that her father died of lung cancer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">his brother Richard</a> attempted to murder her in order to gain control of the family vampire-hunting organization. Fortunately, she is saved after fleeing to the basement when she discovers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Alucard</a> who was sealed there for the last twenty years and after he takes out the mooks and blocks a bullet for her, she shoots her uncle and lives to tell the tale, but damn, what a hell of a day that must have been.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em>: Claus and Lavie swing between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a> - after all, they wouldn't be teenage vanship pilots in their father's old vanship if their mother and fathers were still around - but the loss of both their fathers in the Grand Stream and the later death of Claus' mother is a hard blow that forces the two together into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">makeshift family</a>, to learn how to fly the vanship on their own so they can support themselves and is tied in with their ambition to succeed at the task their fathers failed in, as well as certain plot points involving Alex, captain of the <em>Silvana</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em>: Aside from Johan and Nina (obviously), the former of whom is raised at an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">orphanage designed for brainwashing children into becoming perfect soldiers</a>, there is a whole slew of orphans whose lives are horribly screwed up. A little Czech boy, for example, receives a hint that his mother might be found at the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict">Red Light District</a>, where he ends up witnessing a borderline rape of a druggie hooker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sasuke Uchiha. A perfectly happy child with a large clan that he viewed as an extended family, he returned one night to discover they were dead. All of them except for his beloved older brother. <em>Who had just killed their parents</em>. Needless to say, this had a rather large impact on his future personality (disorders) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">career and life goals</a>.
</li><li> Naruto Uzumaki is an orphan too, and he also has it pretty rough. In fact, there are a lot of orphans, mostly because their parents worked in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">high-risk profession</a>, and all these orphans frequently wind up with severe psychological issues because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends">Natsume's Book of Friends</a></em>, after his parents died, Natsume found himself passed around from distant relative to distant relative because nobody wanted to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> who claimed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">see dead people and monsters</a> everywhere. As a result, he has a great deal of difficulty being open and honest with anyone for fear of rejection.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Asuka and Shinji have been selected as the second and third children to pilot Evas <em>because</em> their mothers are dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their souls were used in the creation of Eva-01 and Eva-02.</span> Shinji's father abandoned his son because he was afraid of him and of screwing him, while Asuka's father, almost immediately after her mother's death, married the woman with whom he was having an affair. It shouldn't surprise anyone that Rei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">doesn't have any parents at all</a>. Also Misato's father was killed with the entire rest of the Antarctic expedition, and Ritsuko's mother killed herself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Gendo got her into his bed to exploit her</span>. This is a major part of each of these characters' plots and one of the main reasons behind the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Dysfunction Junction</a>.
</li><li> Kaji also discovers that Shinji's school is a front for the powers that be, and that <em>all</em> of Shinji's classmates are potential Children candidates, meaning many of them may be orphans as well. It's suggested for two side characters, and canonically stated for one, that their parents are dead as well.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, when Emerald's parents died in an unspecified accident, his relatives essentially played hot potato with him all across Hoenn as none of them wanted to be bothered with taking care with a kid with legit dwarfism. This, along with being bullied for said dwarfism, led to his self-esteem issues and inability to accept help from others.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, many of Fakir's flaws stem from his parents' deaths — particularly the fact that he <em>witnessed</em> them, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was at least partially to blame</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>: Barnaby was orphaned at the age of four and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has since been raised in an orphanage (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">certain circumstances</a> have lead him to believe otherwise).</span> Flashbacks prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">he was a cheerful, contented kid before this</a>; but twenty years later we see him as a cold, cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a> who is hell-bent on avenging his murdered parents. Despite all this he was apparently quite popular at school, is fairly affluent as an adult and competent at his job — not that he'd allow such things to hinder his quest for vengeance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> has numerous characters that are orphans, and touches on not only the trauma of losing parents but the difficult life young Ghouls face once their parents have been killed.
<ul><li> After the death of his mother, Kaneki was left in the care of his maternal aunt and her family. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Suffice to say</a>, it was <em>not</em> a happy home life and he was subjected to considerable resentment, neglect, and outright abuse until he was finally able to move out.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>: Several episodes had children becoming orphans and the Ingalls becoming involved (in some way) to help the children grieve and/or find new housing. Prominent examples:
<ul><li> The Sanderson children — John Jr., Carl and Alicia — are left parent-less after their mother dies of a long illness. Mr. Edwards and his wife-to-be, Grace Snider, agree to take in the children.
</li><li> Albert Quinn, the street urchin left on the streets of Winoka after his drunken father (a dirt farmer) abandons him. The Ingalls take custody of Albert and legally adopt him, but not until overcoming custody challenge by the boy's father (who comes forward only after learning he could lose his potential farmhand).
</li><li> In 1980, a one-up episode was a re-write of an old <em>Bonanza</em> episode ("A Silent Cry") featured a cranky old man (Dub Taylor as caretaker of the Blind School, where Mary is a teacher) wanting to adopt both a "normal" boy and his mute brother and adoption officials want to separate them).
</li><li> In 1981, Charles and Albert are hauling freight with a young couple and their two children (Jason Bateman and Missy Francis, as James and Cassandra Cooper) when a tragic accident involving the other couple's wagon (the horses became spooked and, in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the runaway wagon, the brakes fail) crashes, killing both parents. The two children — who stay behind with Charles and Albert, and witness everything unfold — go into shock, and the Ingalls agree to take them in ... temporarily, until a suitable family is found that will adopt them. It's thought at first James and Cassandra will be taken to a loving home, but the father proves to be anything but (he whips James when he is unfairly accused of stealing). When the children take refuge at the Ingalls after the whipping incident, and Charles — after visiting with the father, who was out looking for the children — senses that the man is abusive, he and Caroline conclude that, despite their already crowded house, they have a moral obligation to take custody of the children. Both James and Cassandra remain a part of the cast for the 1981-1982 season, until the Ingalls' departure for Burr Oak, Iowa, in the fall of 1982.
</li><li> Later in 1981, the bratty orphan, Nancy, is legally adopted by the Olesens. Nancy claims that she was abandoned by her "loving" mother, but she tells this lie to help her cope with the truth: her birth mother had died while giving birth to her (a condition today known as pre-eclampsia), and with hospital officials unable to find her biological father, she is taken to an orphanage. Of all people, it is Mrs. Olesen — the series villain, who had wanted to adopt Nancy just to spoil — who helps her realize she has people who love her and are willing to give her a stable home. And truth be told, Nancy's own instable life prior to being taken in by the Olesens may have played a large role in her personality: Moving around from orphanage to orphanage, liekly much of it not her fault; and abuse (both physical and sexual) that was likely unchecked given the era.
</li><li> In 1982, Laura and Almonzo (by now, the series two main leads) take in their niece, Jenny (Shannen Doherty, in her first major role). Jenny becomes orphaned when her father dies suddenly of heart disease; her mother had died some years earlier. Jenny is shaken by losing her father and tries suicide, but it is a friend of the Wilders — Jeb Carter, who is Jenny's age — that rescues her from suicide by drowning ... and at the same time, overcome his fear of water and shut up Nancy for good.
</li><li> During the 1982-1983 season, Mr. Edwards (a year after divorcing his wife, due to his alcoholism) is involved in two custody battles. In "The Wild Boy," a mute boy is discovered to be orphaned, although he does have someone — a cruel circus master, who had doped the boy so high he acts like "The Wild Boy — "taking care" of him, and Edwards rescues him from the circus to give him a stable home. (An episode later in the season has the boy returning home to his loving biological father.) An episode played more for laughs is when Edwards agrees to take care of Blanche the orangutan, after her master dies suddenly.

The creators stated that they set the show six months after the parents' deaths to avoid making it <em>all</em> about the grieving process, but things are pretty much a mess all around for the Salinger clan, old wounds are constantly reopened, and the story makes it quite clear that being orphaned has changed them into completely different people. Although it was often criticized for being overly sentimental and melodramatic, the cast admitted that while the largest section of the show's fanbase watched for the show's three attractive leads (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleGaze">Scott Wolf and Matthew Fox</a> - while <em>Party</em> was consistently one of Fox's worst-performing shows overall, it was consistently Fox's best-performing show in the 18-49 age range for females), most of the fan mail they received was from orphans praising the show for its' realistic depiction of orphaned life.

He was eventually accepted into an orphanage — one used as a front to provide said organization with plenty of children and teenagers to sacrifice for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">messy magic rituals</a> — and ripened to a nice age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday">sixteen</a>, where his birthday would find him witness to the horrific fates that would befall the rest of his lifelong friends. Panicking and fearful of death before being sacrificed in the actual ceremony, David only escaped after snapping and taking the chances into his own hands, arming himself with a chainsaw and leaving behind a bloody massacre on the way out.

When Luca finally dies and Jowy replaces him as the king of Highlands, the war isn't quite over yet: during a meeting where both sides should have signed a peace treaty, she is being used by Shu, the hero's strategist, as a human shield in order to save the hero's hide (turns out the peace treaty was a trap set up by Jowy), abandoning her to the enemy side (which is, in fact, a good thing since Jowy will take care of her, and it's her reunion with Jowy which grants her speech back). In the end, when Highlands is losing the war, she is sent to Harmonia, a distant country, by Jowy along with Jillia, <em>Luca's sister</em>, in order to survive and start a new life, Jowy staying behind. Yes, she has to leave her only parental figure remaining forever, and flee with the sister of her parents' murderer (in Jillia's defense, she's not crazy like her brother).
