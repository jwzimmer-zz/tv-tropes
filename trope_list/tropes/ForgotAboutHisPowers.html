This is despite having already used the same solution on Tatsuki at an earlier date.

Humanity knows The Blue can't swim or fly very well. (Hello there, aircraft carriers!) Humanity controls at least one giant orbiting space station. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>!) Humanity also has literal Blue-detecting radar. And nukes.

He's not even able to throw a decent punch at the guy, and is made into a whining and crying wimp in his presence just for plot's sake. Example: Muraki is flying away on a helicopter, and Tsuzuki forgets that he can always summon or cast a spell that could blow the helicopter down.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, one episode featured Conan attempting to stop a murder by "Shocking" the murderer into giving up. He shows up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a> and shows a plant that holds sentimental value to the murderer, causing her to break down and cry, saving the intended victim. What our diminutive detective seems to forget is that he wears a watch that shoots tranquilizer darts! Why risk the killer ignoring this when he could just tranq her?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entirety of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>'s plot tension results from the heroes forgetting that they have access to a magical wish giving dragon whose limitations are relatively small. There are limits to what Shenron and Porunga can do (reviving someone who has been killed more than once, reviving multiple people at a time, killing powerful people, reviving people who died of 'natural deaths'... and so on), but the heroes never ever seem to use the dragon's abilities in order to nullify threats. Granted, this is partially due to Goku and friends's desire to fight more powerful opponents, but still.
</li><li> Most of the heroes have extra-sensory awareness, in particular the ability to sense energy and therefore detect opponents they can't see. However, whenever a person has been shrouded by clouds of dust after another person's fierce barrage of attacks, they smile triumphantly until the dust clears and the enemy is unharmed, despite how they should have been able to sense this immediately. This also seems to happen when an opponent moves too fast for them to follow, but then stops still out of their line of sight, resulting in a few moments of desperately looking around for where they went, despite, again, being able to sense where they are. It's possible for characters to conceal their energy by lowering it, but this really isn't something you'd do in combat.
</li><li> In Goku's fight against Cell, there's a part where Goku knocks Cell out of the sky and he hits the ground hard. Future Trunks and a few of the other heroes excitedly think Cell is finished. Annoyed, Vegeta asks them if they forgot how to sense energy; if they would apply it, they would be able to tell Cell isn't even hurt.
</li><li> Most movies are guilty of this, during which all Saiyan characters will magically forget to become Super Saiyan (or whatever the current variation is) for large chunks of the movie, if not leaving it to the climax. This is despite the fact that the Super Saiyan transformations can consistently be accessed at will once they've been reached. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZCoolersRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZCoolersRevenge">Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge</a></em> is probably the most infamous, as Goku's seeming ignorance of this fact is basically the only thing keeping it from fitting into continuity.
</li><li> There's a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZLordSlug">Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug</a></em> where Piccolo, who is being held in the grasp of a giant enemy, is desperately reaching out to Goku so that he can give him his energy. Piccolo completely forgets that he can stretch his arms to impossible lengths, not to mention become a giant himself.
</li><li> In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> scene during the Goku vs. Freeza fight, Freeza opens the ground under Goku, who hangs on the edge as the lava rises from underground. Goku tries to climb, fails and gets his butt burnt by the lava in a comical manner. Except that Goku, like damn near everyone in the show, <em>can fly</em>.

Though this was just a filler scene and it does manage to cut off Frieza's tail, and is later used by Goku against Buu.</span> The big problem with this attack, that it is slow and can be easily dodged if someone sees it coming, or even destroyed if hit from dead angles as seen later on by Jiren. This could be gotten around if the characters realize that they can use the Solar Flare to blind their enemies before using the Kienzan to cut them to pieces. They do not.

</li><li> Goku's Instant Transmission (a form of teleportation) gets used in some pretty clever ways over the series. It makes it even more obvious when he completely forgets about it. The most obvious is the Android Saga, where he never thinks to use it to bail out 18<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1p3xm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1p3xm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1p3xm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Goku explicitly needs to be able to focus on a source of energy to give him a location to jump to, and the Androids explicitly don't give off an energy signature that the Z Fighters could sense. So he can't jump directly to her. But when he jumped in to rescue Piccolo and Tien, 18 was maybe 100 feet away, in absolutely plain sight, he could have just grabbed her and warped away.</span>, and doesn't use it to rescue Piccolo until the latter was nearly dead.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Virtually the entire cast should be able to transform into anything or make illusionary clones of themselves. The latest times these abilities are brought up are when Temari plans to use a clone to act as a diversion then strike immediately after (which is implied to win her the battle had she been able to carry it out) and Naruto transforming clones into rocks to hide them (which is very successful against even a VERY powerful opponent). It's clear these abilities would still be useful even at Kage level confrontations, but instead all characters stick to their gimmick and their gimmick alone.
</li><li> After Naruto reveals that he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>, he promptly never uses it again despite how incredibly useful it is to be so fast he can travel roughly fifty feet in the time it takes the second fastest man alive to punch him, or to escape being captured by Tobi during his and Bee's fight with him and the other Jinchuuriki. Luckily, Kakashi and Gai got there just in time to save him. He then re-conveniences his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> to deflect <em>Tailed Beast Bombs</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Tobi is guilty of this. The only reason the heroes even stand a chance is because he forgot he could easily teleport in, kidnap all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Jinchuuriki</a>, and teleport out without anyone being any the wiser.

However, many times he only uses a technique once, and it's never even mentioned again. It's even more jarring when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he becomes the Ten-Tails Jinchuuriki, as he focuses only on using the Ten-Tails's black substance instead of using any other technique, even if it would help him in the fight (such as Susanoo, which is later shown to be <em>even more powerful</em> with the Tailed Beasts' combined chakra). No wonder Guy handed him his ass in their fight</span>. Partly justified in that Madara was perhaps the most arrogant character in the series, and obsessed with trying out new abilities whenever he could.

Worse, they get overconfident and frequently remove their Pokémon proof measures mid plan allowing them to get electrocuted/burned/etc. anyway later.
</li><li> In an earlier episode Ash and his friends were in the middle of a desert while mentioning they don't have any water. Completely forgetting that they have at least 3 water type Pokémon in their group. <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/e4/ed/02e4ed9a5cabfea29e55c00b259afadb.jpg">Pointed out in this meme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> It is annoyingly common for Ash to randomly forget type advantages and other basic rules about capturing and battling Pokémon when the writers feel it necessary to add some extra drama or explanation to the show. Ash has been known to come up with some pretty impressive strategies from time to time, but when the plot dictates that Ash must lose a battle, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> is practically tied around his neck.

Aside from one instance with Infernape in the beginning and Pikachu in general, he never uses any of them. The sheer raw power they packed would have made a huge difference against Kodai.
</li><li> In the third episode of the <em>Best Wishes</em> series, there is a scene with a group of Pokémon stranded on a disintegrating island in the middle of a lake of boiling water. Some of these Pokémon are Flying-types. They're birds that remember they can fly when they are persuaded to cross a bridge the heroes make so that they can get to safety and that then proceed to FLY AWAY.
</li><li> In the same episode, he almost orders Pikachu to use Thunderbolt on a grounded Sandile, who has Iris' Axew in its mouth. The only thing that stops him from going through with this plan is Iris reminding him that the attack would hurt Axew, not the fact that the Ground-type Sandile is outright immune to electricity. Sometimes, when he actually remembers them, the kid forgets <em>how</em> to properly use his powers.

A simple, no-tech cell. They wait around in it for god knows how long for a Pokémon to retrieve the key when they could've, perhaps, <em>used their Pokémon to bust their way out</em>.

One moment in particular was when Ash and Brock were trying to take down a machine that was weakening Mewtwo, and none of the main cast realizes that they would have a much easier time disabling it using, you know, <em>their Pokémon.</em>
</li><li> And speaking of Team Rocket, they've recently been rejoined by their Wobbuffet, whose gimmick is that it acts as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a>. Unfortunately for them, this skill is rarely used, leading to them repeatedly getting blasted into orbit.
</li><li> There's also Ash's ability to use Aura (basically a renamed Force). In the eighth movie Ash begins to develop these and it's even brought up once or twice in the Sinnoh Arc. Absolute squat comes of it. They might as well have painted a sign that says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel">Fanfic Fuel</a>.

Ranma was supposedly so stupid that he can't lie to anyone and got a poker face that any kid can read. This is contradicted by Ranma playing cards with his friends in the past several times and winning based on his expression (and Ranma being perfectly able to lie and play pretend in several other schemes of his whenever it suited him). Ranma went on later after the arc and to win at cards decisively against Nabiki and Akane. The American version changed all those incidents to Ranma losing so that they can remove the inconsistency.

<ul><li> Usagi often used her disguise pen in the first season to get into areas where access was forbidden otherwise. In later seasons, it was completely forgotten... except for one odd season three episode when Minako borrowed Usagi's pen to act as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityImpersonator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityImpersonator">Identity Impersonator</a> for Sailor Moon. And even in the first season one episode has her entering a swimsuit contest wearing a torn bathing suit that she covers up with bows.

</li><li> In the manga, both Usagi and Minako have devices (a mask and a compact respectively) that can reveal the disguised enemies' true forms; these conveniently get forgotten when it comes to fighting Witches 5 or the Dead Moon Circus, who do disguise themselves as normal people in areas that are <em>known</em> to have connection to the enemies.
</li><li> In the first episode we see that she has super hearing through the gems in her hair and we never get to see her use them again ... ever. In the same episode, her scream/cry is also shown to be some sort of sonic weapon, boosted by her magic, which she also uses <em>one</em> more time in the fourth season, when she and Chibi-Usa both use it while being menaced by an evil dentist.
</li><li> In a season two episode all the girls sans Mercury (who was supposed to be on a plane to leave) get trapped in a freezer with an ice monster. Their game plan is to wait there indefinitely until Mercury conveniently decides not to go and comes to the rescue. One wonders why Sailor Mars didn't think to use her own powers which are...you know...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">based on fire</a>.

In Rua's duel with Devack, he equips his copy of Megamorph to his Power Tool Dragon, thinking it will double PTD's Attack Score. He forgets that, because he and Devack currently have equal Life Points, the card won't do anything. (But to be honest, what player in the actual game has <em>not</em> made <em>that</em> mistake when using Megamorph?)

He finds the Accel Synchro, but Yusei already has a card that can deal with them, and he has it since the beginning of the series: Turbo Warrior.

The Infinity is a Level 1 monster that absorbs Synchro Monsters. Some parts can be replaced by stronger versions of themselves and have higher Levels, but the highest Level so far is 5.</span>.

Abilities the Flash consistently forgets he has: running faster than light, speed stealing, infinite mass punch, etc. On one occasion the villains destroyed a bridge. Flash runs to a university, teaches himself civil engineering, rushes back to the site of the collapsing bridge, scavenges for parts and builds an entire new bridge to replace the old one, all in the blink of an eye. This trope is the only reason anyone is able to beat him.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>, since it's revealed that while the Flash can do all these things and more, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">he doesn't phase through things because it's fairly dangerous, and he can't approach his upper limits because the plot says it would kill him.</a> Luthor, on the other hand, isn't so worried about it when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">mind ends up in Flash's body</a>.

</li><li> In the 4 issue alternate universe DC tale, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, The Flash does become an unstoppable one man war on crime, where he never slows down and has made Keystone City a crime-less utopia. To the point where he moves so fast, not only can he run through the air, he simultaneously exists in the physical and metaphysical planes. However, it's also revealed he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> as he can no longer communicate with anyone (save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>) and cannot <em>stop</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Convergence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Convergence">Convergence: Speed Force #2</a></em>, Wally West is drawn into a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a> Wonder Woman and can't get her to stop hitting him or chasing him... Except Wally has the ability to drain speed from others, effectively making them statues. And you can't even say this was him before he gained that ability, because his children exist, and he had that power before they were born.
</li><li> Examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth">Titans (Rebirth)</a></em>:
<ul><li> When infiltrating Meta Solutions, Dick and Wally's comms stop working, and Wally tells Dick to do whatever he's doing quick. He seems to have forgotten he has <em>super speed</em> and can just run outside, tell the Titans the comms are cut, then go right back in in about 5 seconds.
</li><li> In the same issue, when Mammoth shows up and fights Dick and Wally, Wally seems to have forgotten that he can drain speed, which would've essentially made Mammoth a statue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLazarusContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLazarusContract">The Lazarus Contract</a></em> crossover when Wally is chasing down Slade (who gains briefly super speed), Slade says he's as fast as Wally (somehow), and that since they're on the same playing field now, he can beat Wally. Wally agrees and runs away... because he apparently forgot that he can drain speed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Obviously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> suffers from the same forgetfulness both in the comics and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>. Specifically, he frequently forgets to use his super speed while attacking. At its most ridiculous in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a>, Superman has nearly godlike powers (name any ability, put the word super in front of it, Supes has it) and will conveniently forget them between issues as the plot demands. However, he is in the habit of standing and taking shots to intimidate his opponents so it's not always a case of forgetting. And how anyone ever manages to sneak up on him when he has super hearing is a complete mystery. Except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, because he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">active noise cancellation technology built into his costume for just such an occasion</a>. Similarly, whenever he fights foes that are less powerful but have masterful fighting skills such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, he (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">or rather the writers</a>) tends to forget that he's an expert fighter himself, having been trained by many of the greatest fighters in the universe.
<ul><li> Due to his strength and invulnerability, Superman often forgets he has an effective ranged attack with his heat vision. He could solve many issues from miles away, if he chose.
</li><li> There's also how he hardly ever uses the fact that he is fast enough to phase through objects, making him <em>even more</em> indestructible than he already is. Even more jarring in that the Flash uses this ability multiple times, and youd think Superman would takes notes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> often forgets to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">intangibility</a> so that his enemies can land a punch on him. He also often forgets about his ability to change size and the advanced uses of his telepathy.
</li><li> Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a> has occasionally fallen victim to similar attacks (though it's rarer). In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em>, he was killed by a parasitic alien vine that grew into his bodily systems. A fan wrote in to ask what was up; the editors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">eagerly latched onto his suggestion</a> that "the plant in question isn't entirely tangible itself, and that's why the villain used it". An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">Avengers</a></em> comic had Vision, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, taken out by <em>knockout gas</em>. Hmm, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> who can control winds, an unbreathing android, and a guy in a sealed combat suit?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a></em>'s Silver Age stories are <em>full</em> of this. When he meets a scientist who invents a device that might let him leave Earth but needs money to make it, the Surfer decides to <em>get a job</em>. He can't (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption">he doesn't have a Social Security number, he's not in the union,</a> and he's funny-looking) so almost robs a bank in desperation, forgetting <em>he can manipulate matter</em> and could just make the scientist's gear for him. He spends about eight comics looking for someone who won't hate him for being "a silver-skinned freak" before he remembers that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> were quite friendly...
<ul><li> Similarly, <em>Marvel Cosmic Powers #2</em> has another Galactus herald, Terrax, trying to raise funds to build an army by fighting in gladiatorial arenas for promised wealth. Terrax is most famous for possessing cosmic control of things like moons, asteroids and geological forms of matter. It never occurred to Terrax that he could take control of a single asteroid and extract all its mineral wealth from it with his powers, becoming a trillionaire by Earth standards, and just keep doing it until he becomes the richest being in the galaxy and then raise an army and build an empire that way. He certainly wouldn't need to resort to fighting for purses in the arena in any case. He could easily <em>conquer</em> a world all by himself and then force the inhabitants to be his army.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies">Marvel Zombies</a></em>, the zombies are attacking Doctor Doom's castle and the Scarlet Witch is infected by the Punisher. Gee, Scarlet Witch, did it never occur to you to just teleport him and the other zombies away like you did with Ash earlier? Or teleport Enchantress away earlier so Dazzler wouldn't be infected?
</li><li> The last frame of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> comic featuring the defeat of the Sinister Six in their first appearance had Doctor Octopus, the Vulture, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, and Sandman sitting in a police jail cell complaining about being defeated. How could the Sandman, a being who can turn into sand, be trapped in a common jail cell?
<ul><li> An example involving a power that the character literally cannot forget but writers seem to, many a comic involving Spidey losing to someone generally involves the Spider-Sense not triggering in instances where it <em>absolutely would.</em> Rather blatant examples include the "Confederacy of Dunces" arc in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> (where Spidey is trapped by Frank using a bunch of trigger explosives that weren't actually armed) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadpoolKillsTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadpoolKillsTheMarvelUniverse">Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe</a>, where Dreadpool shoots him point-blank, which the Spider-Sense should have immediately detected and allowed Spider-Man to notice and act before Dreadpool could have even moved the gun into position.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lanterns</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">have been variously shown as being able to warp time, move faster than light, contain supernovas, fight toe to toe with Superman, alter their own DNA, read minds, find subatomic aliens</a>... Scratch that, if it's a superpower of any sort any given GL has used it at least twice. Now here's the thing. There are creatures other than Gods that bother them. Funny huh? It's somewhat justified in their case as their power require willpower and concentration to make anything happen. A GL who is having a bad day, is unfocused or demoralized will be less effective and the GL's are essentially human without their rings (or at least the human ones are.) Plus, their rings require a periodic recharge and anything yellow or anyone whose fast enough or crafty enough to remove a ring is a threat. Still, the idiot plot is somewhat less excusable in the case of veterans like Hal Jordan (or really, any of the Earth based GL's these days) as he is both experienced, and extremely strong willed.
</li><li> The drama that drives the character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange">Adam Strange</a> hinges on a concept that makes little sense in the context of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">shared</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">DC Universe</a>. Adam is a human adventurer from Earth who gets transported to the planet Rann (located in the Alpha Centauri solar system, the closest to Earth) by zeta beams. Once the effect of a zeta beam wears off, Adam gets transported back to Earth and has to wait for the next zeta beam to transport him back to Rann once again. This creates drama (Adam can't stay on Rann indefinitely), and even though every once in a while, writers come up with super-powerful zeta beams that have a permanent effect, eventually another writer may find a reason to undo the effect, leaving Adam stranded on Earth once again. However, it makes little sense in the context of the wider DCU, where there are various more conventional means of traveling the (comparably laughable) distance to Rann. A particularly glaring example occurs in JLA #20-21 (written by Mark Waid), where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a> gets transported to Rann and has to help Adam fend off an invasion. Ultimately, Adam drives off the invaders by sacrificing the zeta beam radiation stored inside his body, which results in him getting transported back to Earth. There are at least three ways to get him back to Rann immediately: First, in the first part of the story, Adam mentions a previous visit to Rann by JLA member Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), who traveled there simply using the power of his ring. Second, the JLA has White Martian jumpships at their disposal, which are used to travel through space several times over the course of the series. And third, the JLA's ranks at that time include Orion and Big Barda of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a>, who have access to Boom Tubes, which can also travel vast distances. All of these methods would allow Adam to return to Rann in a short amount of time, without that pesky temporary effect of the zeta beams. Eventually, this was corrected by placing Rann multiple billions of light-years from Earth, too far for most other methods of travel to reach. But this still doesn't explain why he doesn't ask one of the New Gods for help, since Boom Tubes can explicitly be opened to <em>anywhere in the universe</em>.
<ul><li> Additionally, in the Silver/Bronze Era, Rann was shown to be fairly close to Thanagar, homeworld of Hawkman and Hawkwoman. They shared many adventures and apparently never bothered to offer Adam a ride in the spaceship they regularly used to go between Earth and Thanagar.
</li></ul></li><li> There were multiple examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em>, especially during the fight between the Justice League and Deathstroke. The Flash literally forgets he can do anything aside from "run fast". (Using the Speed Force to speed up his perceptions? Forgotten, unless he <em>wanted</em> to run into a sword. Stealing speed? Gone. Using his healing factor? Gone. Just making a tornado to blow Slade away? Gone.) And Green Lantern somehow forgets he's got the most powerful <em>ranged</em> weapon in the universe on his finger. Its not just that he doesn't create constructs to use against Deathstroke, or capture the man in a force bubble, he doesn't even bother with a simple blast of energy. Instead, he wades in to engage the physically superior Deathstroke in a fist-fight. Any time he's confronted about this mess, Brad Meltzer insists that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> by the editors, who wanted to pump up Deathstroke's "badass" image by basically turning the Justice League into jobbers, although back matter for the series hardcover collection (including excerpts from Meltzer's script) tend to suggest that it was deliberate (Meltzer's notes state that the idea of the fight was that Deathstroke would turn everyone's powers against them but he'd be overpowered when everyone else stopped using their powers; it's a decent idea but falls flat on the page).

<ul><li> The chronic and widespread amnesia over the Iron Queen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> is one of the main causes of The Iron Dominion Saga; the Freedom Fighters are constantly clueless to the fact that their enemy can control machines with her mind, and wind up being shocked each time one of their cyborg or mechanical allies gets turned against them by her. They also keep forgetting that they have a counteragent to her spell <em>right in their own backyard</em>. And in case you're wondering, there's actually a time in the saga where the Iron Queen <em>herself</em> forgets that she has this power, and has to be <em>reminded</em> that the Freedom Fighters are holed up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Grey Goo</a> city that she can manipulate... <em>after she successfully infiltrated and messed it up with her powers</em>.

While early encounters include enemies who are immune to his power for a number of reasons, such as being given immunity by God or not understanding English, writer Garth Ennis apparently got tired of thinking up ways around the power and simply had Jesse stop using it, preferring to use his nigh-superhuman fighting skills instead. The trope is even lampshaded when Tulip asks him why he hadn't used the Word to defeat a group of enemies and Jesse just admits that he forgot about it.

There, both opponents unleash all their energy, triggering a massive explosion. When the smoke clears, out walks a staggering Darkseid, dragging a defeated Thanos—who is now a pet for his sadistic lackey Desaad. The authors apparently forgot that Thanos' ability to withstand damage is equal to Darkseid's in the very least. He also can create force shields, not to mention it was out of character for Thanos to attack opponents on their home turfs without at least gaining information or sabotaging the fight in his favor before confronting them. Thanos also has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">resources</a> to attack Apokolips from orbit if he wanted to.

Only... the Protectobots have the ability to swap around their limbs, meaning they could have just had Streetwise go from being an arm to being a leg, and have a combat-ready (if one-armed) combiner, which they've even canonically done. And Rook always formed an arm before this, so even if they weren't interchangeable, that still would be possible. For that matter, they're imprisoned with Mirage, who also became a combiner limb, but nobody even suggests having him form a leg. Bafflingly, they resolve this problem through forgetting about their <em>weakness</em>—they use the deceased Ambulon as a surrogate leg, ignoring that Ambulon was sliced in half and had a chunk of his corpse converted into a laser cannon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">therefore shouldn't be in a fit state to form anything,</a> and showing no signs of being slowed down by a limb that ought to be completely nonfunctional.

Justified since the movie satirizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></em>, Gandalf rescues Faramir and his retreating troops by using his staff to shine a bright light at the Nazgûl, which scares them away. One might wonder how come he doesn't do that every other time the Nazgûl are around. This is probably the reason why, in the extended edition, Peter Jackson had the Witch-king destroy Gandalf's staff shortly afterwards, something that could not have happened in the book. The official in-universe explanation, according to Tolkien, is that Gandalf is an Istari, a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Maiar</a> (basically a lesser divine spirit and servant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreGreater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreGreater">Valar</a>) who are explicitly forbidden from using their powers to shape change in Middle Earth lest the beings of Middle Earth become too dependent on them. Other Maiar like Sauron and the Balrogs had no such limitation.

He never thinks to wish for weapons, or an army, or even that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Fantasia just be saved</a>. Instead he wishes for things like a can of spray paint and individual steps to climb a huge cliff. And he only has a limited number of wishes before running out of memories (each wish removes a memory, though at the time he gets it, he was unaware of this, so he had no reason to limit his wishes).
</li><li> This gets even worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeverEndingStoryIIIEscapeFromFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeverEndingStoryIIIEscapeFromFantasia">Escape from Fantasia</a></em> where again Bastian has the Auryn and this time he has <em>no</em> limitations to using it aside from being told he can't just wish everyone back into Fantasia. There is literally no end to things he could wish for to outright solve his problem or at least help him. It's especially glaring that this time around his opponents are basically just a group of bullies: he could wish he was strong enough to fight them, for them to give up, for them to turn on each other, for the book to stop working for them, for them lose the book, for them to give the book back, for the cops to just arrest them, for wrought-iron cages to appear around them, for their hearts to stop... this list could easily fill the entire page but he never thinks to use this power until the very end of the film. Even the limitation could easily be wished around by an even remotely intelligent person. Not exactly a move you'd expect from a kid explicitly described as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">a special young human of great imagination</a>", and it's one of many reasons this film is so despised by fans of the series.

And it's possible that the torch had simply been swapped out for other equipment that's more useful to R2's primary roles of interfacing with computers and repairing engines.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>, the first shot we see of Rey is her floating 10 feet off the ground.

<ul><li> This trope is basically the only excuse for why the Fire Nation imprisonment of the Earthbenders didn't fail in five minutes flat. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">cartoon that the film was based upon</a>, their not doing any bending was completely justified as they were on a metallic platform in the middle of the ocean, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage">no earth in convenient distance</a>. In the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockingMacGyverInTheStoreCupboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockingMacGyverInTheStoreCupboard">they're at a mine</a>. As in, surrounded by dirt and rocks. And they outnumber their Fire Nation guards by a minimum of a dozen to one. The very weak "their spirits are broken" excuse is washed away by a speech that boils down to "You're Earth-benders. You're completely surrounded by dirt and rocks. DO SOMETHING." They effectively imprisoned a bunch of soldiers, made them use their loaded guns to dig holes, and the soldiers never thought to shoot.
</li><li> The movie also changes things so Firebenders need an external source for their power to work, so they need to keep torches and braziers everywhere for their bending to work. Nobody ever seems to realize that these limited sources of fire can be <em>put out</em>, or even thinks to extinguish nearby sources of fire whenever they see the Fire Nation coming to deny them ammo.

<ul><li> Potentially justified; God had previously informed Bruce that he couldn't do anything to affect free will, and altering memories would at the very least come close to compromising Grace's free will as she would no longer be able to make a decision based on all available facts.

However, minutes after this, T-1000 in desperation mimics Sarah and calls for John by itself. It's quickly recognized as fake due to liquid nitrogen bath damage, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and it leads to its swift destruction.</span> Therefore it might be that it rightly didn't trust itself to sound convincing.
<ul><li> The prior example of it trying to make Sarah call out could also be justified as the T-1000 being unable to imitate Sarah at this point; prior to this confrontation it had only heard her grunting or screaming rather than anything it could sample to mimic her normal voice.

A few moments later it is revealed that at least one of those tentacles contained a long retractable blade which he could've simply stabbed the wall-crawler with.

Yet when Tom shoots at him with a tranquilizer gun he makes no attempt to run or move out of the way. Even though he's able to move out of the way of incoming <em>missiles</em>, apparently a tranquilizer gun is the only thing that'll take him down. This is never addressed or explained, so the only reason why Sonic doesn't move out of the way seems to be because the plot says so.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf">Lone Wolf</a></em>, you have powers that can be useful in certain situation, but sometimes, the author forgets that the possibility you have that power may exist, and doesn't give you a choice to use the power. More commonly, the series has three levels of powers: Kai, Magnakai, and Grand Master. Most of the powers of one tier have lower powered equivalents amongst the lower tier. Similarly, someone of a higher tier always has all the powers of the lower tier, but only a select few of their given tier. This results in your character often being asked if he has a certain power appropriate for his tier (and bad stuff happening if you do not), but the author forgetting that there is no reason the lower tier equivalent — which everyone should have — could not be every bit as effective. <br/><br/>Theoretically, at least, if the higher Discipline is required, it's for something that the lesser Discipline can't handle for some reason (you see this all the time in Grand Master, particularly with Kai-screen). Justified, for the most part... simple Mind over Matter should not allow you to grab a big, heavy key on the opposite side of the room while you're behind a locked door. Still, there are numerous instances where you SHOULD be able to use Pathsmanship, or Huntmastery, or (most often) Divination, or at least get some explanation as to why you can't. (You don't <em>need</em> Telegnosis to spirit-walk, it just makes it <em>easier</em>.) And then there's the issue of the myriad Combat Skill and Endurance benefits you get from certain Disciplines, all of which need to be properly balanced... and some of which, unfortunately, don't make a lot of sense (in New Grand Master, you have the <em>same</em> Combat Skill whether or not you're armed). As you might imagine, it's not exactly easy to write these things.

<ul><li> An example occurs in "The Philosopher's Stone". When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are trapped in the Devil's Snare (a constricting plant which can only be defeated via light) a panicking, Muggleborn Hermione comments that it would be difficult to light a fire in their current position, despite having the power to create fire magically. Justified given that she's only been <em>aware</em> of magic (let alone consciously using it) for less than a year.
<div class="indent">"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?"
</div></li><li> Called back to in a reversed situation in the final book, when Ron has a momentary lapse of judgement by proclaiming that Crookshanks isn't there to press the knob on the tree's trunk to let them into the passage. Hermione yells at him, "Are you a wizard or not!?"
</li><li> Also in the first book, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> suddenly resorts to grabbing the hero with bare hands, even though seconds earlier he entangled him with conjured ropes.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">the fourth book</a>, Harry uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonToHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonToHand">Accio</a> to summon his broom to get past the dragon in the first task when he could have used the same spell to summon the dragon's egg he was trying to get or summon his broom to fly over the maze in the third task. While never explicitly stated, it is reasonable to believe that the egg would have been protected against the simplest summoning magic, or the task would have turned into a joke. Similarly, while flying over the maze sounds like a cool, out of the box idea, one assumes the judges would have been less than amused.
</li><li> When we first meet Harry, he has experienced ten years of abuse and mistreatment at the hands of the Dursleys. He has become quite perceptive and adept at reading their behavior, and is able to occasionally get his way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">by setting up his requests</a> in such a manner that they view the best option for them is to give him what he wants. He is also usually extremely patient with their abuse and vitriol. Essentially, he makes the best of a bad situation by manipulating people who hate him. However, whenever he is at Hogwarts, Harry is completely clueless at social interaction, or understanding the larger picture. He often misses social cues, and repeatedly gets himself into trouble by letting himself be goaded by the likes of Malfoy, Snape, and Umbridge.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens quite a bit in the Ancient Indian epic poem <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ramayana">Ramayana</a></em>. As an avatar of Vishnu, Rama should be completely over-powered in the human realm. Instead, Rama seems to forget that he is a god until the other gods remind him. In the original version of the poem, Valmiki's version, this happens more than once.

Having been established as: (a) streetwise, (b) adept at survival, (c) having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">a ton of money</a>, (d) being able to defeat just about any enemy with a combination of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerMeltdown">Superpower Meltdown</a> powers; at least half of the scrapes he gets himself into are caused by a combination of him deliberately walking unprepared into lethal environments or conveniently forgetting about one or more of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> in order to allow a different character to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment. There's also at least one scene in <em>Trouble Magnet</em> where he <em>does</em> rely on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> power to get himself out of a scrape, only to have it not work on him thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>... a fact he really ought to have taken into account considering how frequently it happens to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> the power they use requires the sorcerer being able to steel themselves against the forces involved (otherwise they could literally push themselves into the ground -or worse), and takes a toll on their more-than-mortal but still-limited minds and bodies. Sometimes a lot of power has to be used at once; Belgarath ran head-first into trouble by literally working himself to magic-use exhaustion. But many times they just don't use a simple possibility they have, rather going for an incredibly contrived method that somehow seems like a genius idea. In the <em>Malloreon</em>, Belgarath, Belgarion, and Zakath have to fight a dragon, which is immune to direct sorcery. He makes Garion and Zaketh immune to fire to face the dragon, and has no doubts that this will work, demonstrating that indirect sorcery can be used. Despite this and 7000 years of experience, the idea of translocating large rocks above the dragon's head, or something similar, never occurs to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeCat">Time Cat</a></em>, Jason and Gareth are often captured and held somewhere against their will. Despite having the power to travel to any point in space or time, Gareth never uses his magic to allow them to both escape.

Harry has a small arsenal of magical tools on him (staff, shield bracelet, force rings, blasting rod, and various other odds-and-ends), and he has a wide range of spells he can draw from (bursts of flame, blasts of force, lightning bolts, wind, etc). Therefore, unless the reader is paying very close attention, they'll miss something important: Throughout the novel, Harry uses most of his gear and most of his spells, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he doesn't use either fire magic or his blasting rod beyond the initial brawl in the first chapter</span>. It isn't until later on that the reason becomes apparent: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mab, queen of the Winter Court, took his blasting rod and put a lock in Harry's mind that kept him from using fire magic, so that the fire-based Summer Court couldn't track him down and kill him</span>.

The conflict becomes a lot less believable when you remember that Cassie could just <em>morph to bird and save herself</em>. Justified since it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to have been a dream Jake was having</span>, possibly at the instigation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> some alien</span> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">was never mentioned again</a> and Jake noticed the many oddities to realize this.
</li><li> In general, an oft-cited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> in the series involves Tobias, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">gets trapped in the form of a hawk</a> at the end of the first book, and afterwards can only take human form for two hours at a time after the Ellimist restores his morphing ability. It's well-established that the Animorphs have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Power</a> of "thought-speak" (telepathic communication) when morphing, which allows them to communicate with each other while in the form of animals that shouldn't be able to speak. Tobias is obviously capable of speaking while he's in human form—but logically, he should also have thought-speak abilities as a human, since his human form is a <em>human</em> morph. While in human form, Tobias often gets into sticky situations where telepathy would presumably come in handy, but he <em>never</em> uses it, and never seems to remember that he should have it.

<ul><li> In <em>Tales of the Masks</em>, after a rockfall has buried his pal Pohatu, Kopaka gives up on trying to locate him and instead heads for Pohatu's village to report some sad news, only for Pohatu to show up alive — which Kopaka would have noticed, had he thought of using the Mask of X-Ray Vision that's almost constantly on his face.

Outside of some of the online animations, they basically never use these abilities other than that of their original mask, and even then, there's a lot of times where, for instance, Tahu seems to forget to turn on his Mask of Shielding and gets smacked in the face in the middle of a fight.

But despite how powerful and useful they are, according to one source, he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">such a rotten temper</a> that he often forgets about them completely and just charges into battle with his warhammer. (Of course, with a title like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">The Prince of Wrath</a>, it isn't surprising.)
</li><li> This happens in general to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> players, especially as they attain higher levels and have amassed a big catalog of magical artifacts, spells, and such. Forgetting about fantastic powers and resorting to mundane utility is one of the many jokes surrounding the 10-foot pole.
</li><li> Mechanically enforced by barbarian rage. One of the effects in almost all editions is that while raging, the character forgets how to use spells, spell-like abilities, and skills involving concentration.
</li><li> Can also happen when the Dungeonmaster is playing powerful, high-level <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> who have so many spells and spell-like abilities, that it's hard to remember them all.

This can result in players realizing, after the fact, that the mess they just got themselves into could have been completely avoided if only they'd used a Charm they forgot about.
</li><li> An article in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> #135 described an incident in a <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> RPG campaign where a supervillain had captured all the PCs, neutralized their known powers, and was preparing to use them as a power source for a magical ritual. At the very last minute, one of the players remembered their character had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink">Psychic Link</a> with a hawk that they rarely, if ever, used. The GM ruled that since the player almost forgot about that ability, the villains didn't know about it (and hence didn't neutralize it). The player had the hawk fly into the villain's headquarters and free one of the heroes, who freed the rest of the team, and the newly released heroes defeated the surprised villains.
</li><li> The 4th Edition era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> supplement Golden Age Heroes includes a superman expy that had, among his other powers, super intelligence that only kicked in if he made an intelligence roll at his normal default. It was explained that he had to remember he had super-intelligence in order to use it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes">DC Heroes</a></em> had a game where the player-character, Superman, had to break through a wall and decide whether to spend time repairing it (and losing points) before continuing on his mission. The writers must have forgotten that in the DCH system, super-speed allows you to vibrate through walls, because if Superman does so, he can end the game with a <em>better</em> than perfect score.

It all happens immediately after the tutorial, where Mason was instructed on how to use his wrist-mounted repair tool. Mason doesn't think to just use it to repair the Terraformer, and his commander doesn't suggest it at all. Neither does the AI living in the repair tool itself. At the very end of the game, your wrist-mounted AI friend tells you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that you can go up and repair the terraformer, which would conveniently kill off the Plague as well.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series has a bad habit of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">biotic</a> characters forget that they can control gravity with their minds.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Commander Shepard</a> is scripted to act like the default Soldier class regardless of what biotic or tech skills they have. This leads to such instances as a Vanguard Shepard trying and failing to catch up to a fleeing enemy by running despite having access to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">Foe-Tossing Charge</a> that goes faster than light. It took until the final DLC in the trilogy for Shepard to use their biotics in a cutscene.
</li><li> Kaidan Alenko falls into the same trap as Shepard despite his biotics and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> he endured to use them effectively being such a significant part of his character. The most notable instances are on Horizon in the second game, where he attempts to shoot the Seeker swarms instead of keeping them away with a barrier, and when confronting Eva Core in the third game and once again attempting to shoot her instead of using his biotics. Like Shepard, it takes until the final DLC of the whole trilogy for Kaidan to use his biotics in a cutscene. Kaidan's case is at least partially explainable by the fact that he is in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter">Static Role, Exchangeable Character</a> situation with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Ashley Williams</a> from the end of the first game onward; remembering to use his powers would create too much extra work for the developers and cause their stories to deviate too much.
</li><li> Thane Krios zigzags this in the third game when he fights Kai Leng. He does eventually use his biotics in their duel, but long after it would have been the most opportune to do so.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Pathfinder Ryder</a> ends up in the same situation as Shepard before them. Even if the player opts to give Ryder biotics before they become Pathfinder, there is no indication of this in dialogue or cutscenes; Shepard's biotics at least got a few mentions in dialogue even if it didn't show in cutscenes. The prologue and Cora's loyalty mission both involve moments where it would make sense for Ryder to help with biotic barriers, but both times Ryder stands back and lets Cora do everything. There is also no option in dialogue to compare notes with Cora, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">spent most of her life as an outsider</a> because of her powers, nor is there any option to talk with Ryder's twin about how the incident that gave them their powers was a contributing factor in their mother's death.
</li><li> Peebee's loyalty mission leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision">Friend or Idol Decision</a> where she has to choose between losing an extremely valuable artifact or letting her ex-girlfriend that she still cares for fall into a river of lava. It doesn't occur to Peebee that she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">save both</a> by grabbing the artifact with her biotics and then going back to help her ex. Like Ryder, Peebee also doesn't help with the barrier in Cora's loyalty mission if she is present, despite having the ability to do so.

A naked mage with no items can still transport themselves to any major city at will. However, if the plot calls for them to be imprisoned then they will politely stand there and wait for rescue. Hearthstones cause this problem on an even more general level since they are small stones that transport the bearer to safety from anywhere. These are not a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> occasionally make use of them as well, so anyone that is not actively being attacked should have a means of escape.

As part of the defense, the hunters raise a large barricade to block Velkhana's path and give the player a chance to weaken it. One problem with that: <em>Velkhana can fly</em>. Despite this, the dragon just sits on the ground and attacks the barricade rather than just flapping its wings a few times to fly above it.

Additionally, V had a raven familiar (Blackwing) who would literally appear and disappear as V demanded (and usually only upon reminder from other characters) as a riff on the way that many D&amp;D players would forget about their familiar (or simply not mention them) unless they were getting a concrete bonus.

With the power of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> ring, Dodgers makes a speech about how he now has the ability to fly, which his ancestors could only dream of ... while a flock of ducks pass behind him.
</li><li> And to prove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, Daffy's flying <em>and</em> swimming, or lack thereof, provides one of the honestly funniest jokes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> has to offer:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Daffy:</strong> What? I can't fly! <br/><strong>Porky:</strong> But you're a duck! <br/><strong>Daffy:</strong> I'm not that kind of duck! <br/>(Later) <br/><strong>Porky:</strong> We have to jump! <br/><strong>Daffy:</strong> But I can't swim! <br/><strong>Porky:</strong> You can't fly, You can't swim! Are you even a duck at all?! <br/><strong>Daffy:</strong> I'm not sure. This comes off very easily. (takes off his beak)
</div></li><li> On a related note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a> would do the same thing. In one cartoon, he actually commented that sometimes he forgets he's a bird.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>. In the episode "Blush" the "Wade-bot" launches itself off a cliff in the Amazon with Ron and Rufus, however Wade only remembers after the leap that he forgot to install the parachute. Just a few minutes earlier <em>in the same episode</em> the Wade-bot had a hang-glider attachment to save Ron and Rufus from plummeting down a waterfall, and conveniently forgets about this gizmo once its could be useful again.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, where Dojo is under the madness that strikes him every 600 years, he swallows the monks, Jack, and Wuya. Eventually, the monks find the two villains in Dojo's cavernous stomach, Jack being close to panic. Jack asks Wuya why she, being a spirit, can't just fly out; Wuya thinks about it, says "Good point," and does so. (Leaving Jack behind, much to his regret.)
</li><li> To move the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plot</a> of a typical episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, either Cosmo and Wanda's magical wands are stolen, or more commonly Timmy has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">stupidly</a> forget that he is able to alter reality on a whim. Naturally this has been lampshaded quite a few times. For example, in the episode "Where's Wanda" Timmy proceeds to turn the world into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> and become a detective in order to track Wanda down... when he could have easily just wished her back. He notes, "All I had was my trenchcoat, hat, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">unlimited supply of magical wishes</a>. The odds were against me." Also lampshaded in "Nectar of the Odds": Timmy unsuccessfully tries to make his lemonade taste better using cheese, taco sauce, peas, and chocolate laxatives. While Timmy goes to the bathroom (after trying the laxatives), Wanda wonders why he doesn't just <em>wish</em> for sweeter lemonade. "Father Time" is probably the most egregious example. If Timmy had simply wished for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">his father's trophy to be unmelted by heat vision</a>, the episode's plot could've been resolved in <em>five seconds</em>. Although, to be fair, he WAS going to wish for that, but Cosmo talked him into going back in time to prevent his father from winning the trophy in the first place.
<ul><li> Sometimes used as a recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> with Timmy's heat vision. He never wished it away, so he technically still has it. In at least one episode, he remembers that he actually still has the power of heat vision and uses it.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, there are too many times to count in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> where Danny seemingly forgets that he has the ability to become invisible or intangible at will. Early on it made sense due to it being clear he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">still getting used to his abilities</a>, and sometimes it was played for humor, but he would still sometimes forget even in the later episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> While this was a regular occurrence for characters, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> is the king of this trope. He has the ability to transform into whatever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strong</a> forms he can imagine — an ability he uses three times in the <em>entire series</em>. He'll stare at incoming projectiles with a surprised look on his face instead of turning intangible, or super solid or transforming into a form that cannot be so easily hit. Many is the time he'll forget he's capable of flight, super speed, superhuman strength, telepathy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>, phasing through matter, changing his density (allowing him to increase his strength to Superman levels or become a liquid or gas), healing factor, and genius-level intellect and take a hit he could have easily dodged or blocked from a foe who really should have been no match for him. In the season finale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> is holding everyone in an iron grip with tentacles. They struggle for an unreasonable time before J'onn remembers that he can <em>turn intangible at will</em>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> comics, he had even more powers, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">new ones popping up all the time</a>. Somehow, he just never used them with the slightest tactical sense. On the other hand, with powers ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> to making ice cream with your mind, it's hard to create conflict.
</li><li> Superman never, ever remembers he has super speed, period. The many, many instances where Superman would be felled by an electrical field, despite the fact that he is supposed to be invulnerable. This got to be so bad that in the second season the writers actually started to show less of Superman getting taken out by an electrical shock or something along those lines, and more of his invulnerable side. There's also the many times when he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> could easily solve a problem by just using heat vision. Even when their opponent is non-living they seem to forget that they're capable of this. Also, he almost never flew in combat throughout most of the first season, meaning he would often just get into fistfights with people equally strong or stronger than him who couldnt fly, when he could easily just float above them dropping stuff on them or swooping down to punch them and rising back up as they shake their fists impotently up at him.
</li><li> In one episode, Flash has most of his body encased in ice by a villain. Too bad he was too distracted trading barbs with the villain to remember he could vibrate his limbs at super speed and would be able to melt the ice.
</li></ul></li><li> And if you think the above examples are bad, you should watch the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em> some time. "Gee, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderTwins">Jayna</a>, here we are trapped under the foot of a giant space monster, touching each other. If only we had, I don't know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderTwinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderTwinPowers">some kind of superpower that would allow you to turn into a small animal and me into something which could flow through the claws, we could escape!</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Seanbaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Seanbaby">Seanbaby</a>, as you can assume, mocked this liberally.
<div class="indent">"Don't be too quick to judge Superman's alzheimers problems, though. You probably forget about your powers sometimes too. You can't fly, but you have the ability to learn to waterski, bake, watch baseball, and put objects in your ass. If Lex Luthor came at you with a mind deconfribrulator, you'd be so scared you'd totally forget to learn to waterski. Also, you probably wouldn't jam anything into your ass. See? You forgot about at least TWO super powers, smartass."
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>, frustratingly, tended to combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman</a>. Very often in the series, Aquaman would be taking part in the obligatory underwater part of the villain's plan, and then he would be attacked by a sea monster. He would proceed to spend a frustratingly long time either dodging it or getting caught in its grasp, before he finally remembers "Oh, right, I can communicate with sea life" and that he can just tell the monster to go away. Frequently, he wouldn't even do that, and would instead summon <em>more</em> sea creatures to fight it.
</li><li> Aquaman and Wonder Woman constantly forget they have super strength. They often get grabbed by mooks and/or imprisoned and don't even try to break free. Yet in some episodes, Wonder Woman can bust down walls, hold up a building, and in "Will the World Collide", she threw an object into space. In some episodes, Aquaman can lift a bulldozer and even lift a beached ship to throw it back into the water.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bat Suit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> has rocket propulsors in the boots for flight and optic camouflage for invisibility, but Terry often forgets about them and uses these abilities much less than he ought to. Many is the time in the heat of battle he'll run after a foe when the flight would be much faster, and many is the time he'll attempt to sneak into an area without turning invisible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">In his defense</a> he <em>is</em> fairly new at the job, and gets better at using the Bat Suit's functions as the series goes on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em>, the titular Zeta has a lot of abilities he never uses to their full potential. Somewhat justified as Zee has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyWasBornYesterday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyWasBornYesterday">Really Was Born Yesterday</a> kind of naivete when it comes to anything outside of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">intended purpose that he refuses to do</a>, and Ro is a teenager who's somewhat in over her head, but still:
<ul><li> He has unlimited money. He can buy as much of anything he wants at any time. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">greasing the right palms</a> he could have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Agent Bennet</a> called off his case or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>, he could hire people to interfere and screw with Bennet's team, he could just stage a meeting with Dr. Selig, he could hire a team of private investigators to find the man for him, the list goes on. You would assume he'd use this for a lot more than just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">replacing the vehicle they lost last episode and dry-cleaning Ro's same outfit so it's ready for the next episode</a> but you'd be wrong.
</li><li> Zeta always uses the exact same holographic persona to hide, the same one that's plastered all over wanted posters everywhere, and gets recognized by local police or people all the time. Again, you'd think he'd try new disguises from time to time to render said wanted posters ineffective, but again, you'd be wrong. Even Ro never bothers to change her outfit or general appearance in spite of having unlimited money, as mentioned above.
</li><li> The money thing isn't just Zeta. <em>Hunt In The Hub</em> has a corrupt scientist disable Zeta's unlimited money function in order to blackmail him into stealing parts the scientist can't afford. Say it with TV Tropes, kids: HE COULD JUST ASK ZETA TO BUY THEM FOR HIM. Money is no object for the machine and the man has information on Dr. Selig he could give in exchange; he could have obtained the parts through (on paper) entirely legitimate means and made friends with Zeta but he instead opts to make an enemy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> and trash half The Hub to get them, making an enemy of the duo and getting his butt thrown in prison to boot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">With brains like that, it's no wonder nobody's investing in his research...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven">Raven</a> is easily the most overpowered of the five, which is made glaringly obvious in season 4. As such, this is the only way to keep the entire team necessary. Raven often conveniently forgets that she can fly and teleport in situations where those powers would be highly useful, and <em>stop time</em>. She also rarely uses her telekinesis to restrain opponents or hurl them away from the scene of a battle, rather than just tossing debris at them. She's done it before, to both allies and enemies, so it's not an issue of being unable to do so. There's only one episode where she concentrates and simply <em>cuts</em> the baddie's armor with her power. <em>One</em>. Several times she's proven to be much more powerful than the entire Green Lantern Corps put together, other times she's almost helpless. It's not helped by one episode explicitly stating that her powers go haywire if her emotions do, and despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">stoic facade</a> her emotions are often tempestuous.
</li><li> No matter how many missions the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> go on, they always seem to forget that, first and foremost, while on Lyoko one cannot die from lasers and swords, they can only be devirtualized. They will also forget their most important abilities at the worst times.
<ul><li> For example, Aelita could use her Creativity power to create terrain barriers around herself, but even in dangerous situations where she has enough time, she quite often forgets that she can do this. She is the most obvious offender, but the others are often guilty as well. Aelita also forgets that XANA will NOT kill her starting with Season 2, despite this being proven in the first third of the season. The "dying" thing is somewhat justified though. While they do just devirtualize, it's implied they can't go right back into Lyoko. It's also implied that Aelita using her powers too often or to make something <em>really</em> big exhausts her. It's not so much that she forgets her power, it's that using Creativity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a> and each use costs 50 of her 100 points. Though this is more an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">Informed Flaw</a> than anything else.
</li><li> Ulrich is a much worst offender. When he was first introduced, his Triplicata allowed him to summon two illusion of himself to trick the enemy. In season 2, it was upgraded so they could fight and hurt enemies of their own, with Ulrich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">once defeating an entire army of monsters thanks to it</a>. Comes season 4, he forgets the upgrade when fighting William (who easily devirtualizes the real one) before forgetting the power altogether for the whole season. He doesn't uses it again until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CodeLyokoEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CodeLyokoEvolution">Code Lyoko: Evolution</a></em>, and when he does, it's portrayed as just the illusion trick.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em>, Nega-Duck uses a device to steal the powers from the other four members of the Fearsome Five, and then escapes from the presumed escape-proof super-villain prison by using the Liquidator's control of water to part the waters of the bay and walk to the mainland. As Darkwing and the four villains watch, the Liquidator remarks, "Now why didn't I think of that?"
</li><li> This seems to be a staple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em>, especially in regards to Captain Hero, who takes this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a> levels. More often than not though, he is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">sociopathic</a>. Lampshaded at the start of the second season, when he says that he could have saved the rest of the cast from the crashing helicopter, but he was unable to react, "because (he) smoke(s) mariujana."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMightyHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMightyHercules">The Mighty Hercules</a></em> cartoon series of the 1960's, Hercules had a magic ring that would endow him "with the strength of ten ordinary men" (according to his theme song). Along with invulnerability and superhuman reflexes. In each episode, Hercules would go to fight the episode's monster and get the snot beaten out of him. And then he would remember he has the ring.
</li><li> Cheetara from The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> constantly forgets her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> that can instantly defeat most of their enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">1980s</a> Cheetara forgets the same thing. Partially justified in that her Anointment Trial episode shows her having a limited upper endurance. But most of the battles aren't <em>that</em> long.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> Apparently Bloom forgot about her healing powers in the 24th episode of the fourth season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since she didn't do anything to try to save Nabu</span>.
</li><li> The Winx get backed off a cliff in the Omega Dimension in season three. No explanation is given for why they don't use their wings.
</li><li> There's also an episode in the first season (towards the end) where the girls go to Domino/Sparx. At the end of the first part (it's a two-part episode), Bloom, who's currently powerless, is about to fall into a chasm. Stella was transformed at this time and could've easily flown over and grabbed Bloom, yet she didn't! Or could have used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telekinesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telekinesis">Telekinesis</a> she only showed once.
</li><li> Darcy has proved herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">strong enough to open a fissure in the ground by stomping</a> and capable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">create fires that Bloom (who has the explicit power as the most powerful fire user of the series) can't put off</a> (the only other time this happens it's by use of the fire part of the all-powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Spell of Elements</a>). She never repeated either performance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>. All too often the Jedi Knights seem to forget that they have the ability to lift anything as heavy as a spaceship without touching it, jump high distances, and possess lightning quick reflexes. Curiously these bouts of stupidity come up when they're fighting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> character such as Cad Bane (who seems to have the unofficial power of handing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> to anybody he's fighting at the moment), whom you think a Jedi could reduce to a pile of disembodied limbs within seconds. And of course it is not a coincidence that this always happens when around the series' original characters.
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> when the townspeople chase Buttercup. She starts running from them before reassessing the situation and flying away. Similarly when Mojo drops the Girls in a trap door along with Harry Pit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsHaveCooties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsHaveCooties">a boy who is thought to have cooties.</a> The Girls simply run around in circles to avoid him completely forgetting that they can just fly out of the trap, which they only remember <em>after</em> they get over their fear.
<ul><li> Played painfully straight in the very first episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">the 2016 series</a>: the earth shatters and the girls <em>fall</em> down into the resulting chasm. Once again, the Powerpuff Girls, who can not only fly, but fly <em>fast enough to rupture space-time</em>, fall into a pit.

Smythe has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a> bound and gagged in an electrified bubble, with the gag obviously preventing her from warning Spider-Man about the trap.

<ul><li> Twilight Sparkle is an extremely gifted and versatile magician but <em>constantly</em> seemingly forgets spells she's used in the past without any trouble that certainly seem applicable. Why she doesn't just just freeze up an enemy's body like she did to her friends in Castle Mane-ia or turn them into a breezie is anyone's guess.
</li><li> In the episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen". Twilight Sparkle is forced to take a leap of faith off a cliff to escape a Hydra when she mysteriously forgets she can teleport, as has been seen in at least two previous episodes, including the pilot. This happens anytime the plot requires her to be threatened by some impending doom. It is occasionally justified by her being under a great deal or stress at the time, such as a later example where she is blocked by a simple locked gate. While she can still teleport while under stress (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">indeed, she does it a lot in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero">one case</a>), her ability to make sound judgments has a tendency to nosedive under certain circumstances, usually those that involve her losing control or worrying too much.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E19PuttingYourHoofDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E19PuttingYourHoofDown">Putting Your Hoof Down</a>, Fluttershy once again forgets that she can fly, getting stuck behind two ponies blocking the bridge over the river she needs to cross.
</li><li> More a case of Forgot About Her Reputation, but in "It's About Time", it never occurred to Twilight that, as the personal student of the ruler of Equestria, that she would have free access to the royal library. Instead, she tries to sneak in. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Twilight is the only one who forgets this</a>, and when she is recognized by a guard, he amiably greets her and unlocks the door to the restricted section of the library for her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">As noted above, this one can be excused</a> by the fact that she hasn't slept for several days and is deep into a nervous breakdown at this point. Paranoid delusions would not be surprising in that state.
</li><li> The changelings from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E26ACanterlotWeddingPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E26ACanterlotWeddingPart2">A Canterlot Wedding</a> on their own are basically watered-down alicorns, having both flight and magic-based attacks. They seemingly forget this when they decide to attack the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Mane 6</a> by shapeshifting into them, which disables one or <em>both</em> of these abilities depending on who they have turned into. To make matters worse, their shapeshifting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">''works too well''</a> as the Changelings seem to be unable to tell themselves apart from the real deals, and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedleInAStackOfNeedles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedleInAStackOfNeedles">you're trying to find just six real ponies</a> among <em>dozens</em> of imposters, it isn't easy. It wasn't until they actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">dumped this strategy</a> that they were finally able to overwhelm and defeat the Mane Six. Notably in their second attack they learned from this, instead only using shape shifting to fool or confuse opponents and relying entirely on their true forms for combat.
</li><li> In "The Crystal Empire, part 2" Twilight and Spike need to climb an incredibly long stair-case, and was complaining about it. Just as the viewers are wondering why she doesn't teleport, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight">levitate</a> herself upwards, she decides to instead use a <em>new</em> power; gravity reversal!
</li><li> The entire plot of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E10SpikeAtYourService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E10SpikeAtYourService">Spike At Your Service</a>" only happens because Spike the <em>fire-breathing dragon</em> doesn't breathe fire on the monsters that are <em>made of wood and smell of sulfur.</em>
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E7Bats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E7Bats">Bats!</a>" both Rarity and Twilight should have been able to yank <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flutterbat</span> out of the sky with telekinesis rather than chasing her around and finally relying on an elaborate trap. Of course, they never do. What makes it even worse is that they are clearly shown using telekinesis other times in the very same episode.
</li><li> Parodied in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E7WonderboltsAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E7WonderboltsAcademy">Wonderbolts Academy</a>" when Fluttershy, the one <em>pegasus</em> from the hot air balloon, needs to be rescued from the fall along with her friends. Cue her sheepishly fluttering away from her rescuer who is also annoyed when they notice her wings. This is consistent with past demonstrations that her wings lock when she's sufficiently scared, in a strange inversion of what seems to be a normal Pegasus reaction of raised wings.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E8RarityTakesManehattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E8RarityTakesManehattan">Rarity takes Manehattan</a>" Twilight doesn't even <em>try</em> using her princess authority to help Rarity get a taxi. Or teleport her around. Rainbow doesn't try to fly her, or Applejack pull her in a cart...
</li><li> Even Discord, Equestria's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a>, tends to just be a deer-in-headlights whenever caught off guard. Though he does try to subvert this at the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E11ThreesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E11ThreesACrowd">Three's a Crowd</a>" (in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>, he tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFingersnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFingersnap">Badass Fingersnap</a> the Tatzlwurm away; but it sneezes on him before he can).
</li><li> At the beginning of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E14StrangerThanFanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E14StrangerThanFanFiction">Stranger Than Fan Fiction</a>", Daring Do seemingly forgets she can fly, reacting fearfully when the rickety <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RopeBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RopeBridge">Rope Bridge</a> she is crossing starts breaking. Of course, as soon as it collapses, she just flies the rest of the way. This is later lampshaded with Rainbow Dash in the same episode (unfortunately, Quibble Pants <em>can't</em> fly).
</li><li> Possibly the worst offender is the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E26ToWhereAndBackAgainPart2">To Where and Back Again</a>" where Queen Chrysalis is defeated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">slowly flies away over the horizon</a> as literally every main character just stands by and watches. Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, Princess Cadance, you gonna grab her with your telekinesis or trap her with a spell? Shining Armor, can't you seal her inside a barrier? Is Rainbow Dash or any of the fliers going to give chase? Discord, couldn't you snap a finger and put a cage around her or turn her into a muffin or something? No? Just asking.
</li><li> One also wonders why Twilight Sparkle doesn't ask for more of that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E1PrincessTwilightSparklePart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E1PrincessTwilightSparklePart1">"Remember Past Events Potion"</a> from Zecora to help Spike figure out his origins and the identity of his parents, considering there's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E21DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E21DragonQuest">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E24FatherKnowsBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E24FatherKnowsBeast">episodes</a> dedicated to the simple fact he's <em>desperate</em> to know where he came from. Never mind that it could probably also be pretty darned helpful to understand the motivations of antagonists in a series where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">sympathetic backstory = easy redemption</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E25ShadowPlayPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E25ShadowPlayPart1">unraveling the mysteries of the past</a>.
</li><li> In the finale of "The Beginning of the End," King Sombra becomes a villainous example. When the aforementioned Discord intervenes, Sombra just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">fires basic beams at the one guy they're guaranteed to fail against</a>... when he could just unleash his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> crystals that have managed to trap Alicorns (semi-Discord on the power scale), incapacitate the Tree of Harmony (even stronger than Discord), etc.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens to a number of characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>. The worst offender is Kitty, who seems to forget that she can become intangible with some regularity. Xavier also seems to forget that he has telepathy sometimes. Wolverine is constantly surprised by people sneaking up on him even through he can smell people from a distance.
</li><li> Jake the Dog from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> often forgets that he has the seemingly unlimited ability to grow, shrink, stretch, and otherwise change his shape. Which would solve the central conflict of many episodes very easily. Unlike most examples of this trope, this is justified: he is an idiot. Jake provides an alternative justification in "Box Prince", where he explains to BMO that he doesn't always use stretching when it could solve his problems because then he wouldn't have enough challenges in his life for it to be interesting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Toph, despite having highly toned senses through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Earthbending</a>, can't figure out that the group is walking into a trap at Lake Laogai or that it's actually Azula and not Ozai waiting for them in "The Day of Black Sun", despite both the trap and Azula being in <em>caves</em> made mostly of rock and dirt. Admittedly there are Earthbenders in both traps, who have a similar sense, so they might know of a way to mask themselves.
</li><li> One episode has Toph create a set of rocky armor for herself that covers every part of her except her eyes—ignoring that her blindness and inherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a> should make eyeholes somewhere between pointless and dangerous. The creators apparently intended it to expose her mouth instead, but a mixup with the animation team led to a pretty baffling visual.
</li><li> The sequel series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, has Mako, who is fully capable of lightning bending but only rarely actually uses that ability.
</li><li> You could be forgiven for forgetting that metal bending is a specialized version of earth bending, because the metal bending police force certainly has. They seem so entirely focused on using their metal tethers that they are completely useless against a threat they cannot physically restrain. Resulting in scenes in the first season where a dozen or so expert earth benders are being defeated by mechs because they forget they have better powers in their arsenal than simply wrapping metal ropes around it and hoping their fleshy human bodies are enough to stop it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ben starts out with 10 possible alien forms, each one with their own powers, and only got more as the story went on. Sometimes, the trope is justified by the Omnitrix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">screwing with him by not giving him the right form</a>, but others he just seems to fail to realize one form would be more fitting than another for a specific situation. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> puts it further, where he seemed to have forgotten he can just <em>watch the dial to see what form he is about to use</em>.
</li><li> It used to be that once Ben transformed, he was stuck that way until the Omnitrix timed out. As the series progressed, he gained the ability to change directly from one form to another, or to manually revert back to human and select a different alien (as the cooldown time is typically ignored when it's not necessary to the plot). Yet he will still often change into an alien he doesn't want and just ride it out rather than reselect. While this could be chalked up to the Omnitrix's temperamental nature preventing him from switching, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says there are no such problems with the model he has in Omniverse.
</li><li> Humongousaur stands out as a particular offender. When first introduced, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SizeShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SizeShifter">Sizeshifter</a> capable of growing to incredible sizes. This ability apparently was forgotten after <em>Vengeance of Vilgax</em>. This may have been to keep the character from having too much role overlap with Way Big.
</li><li> This trope wasn't limited to Ben, either. Gwen had a serious tendency to forget she could fly and had telekinesis in Alien Force and Omniverse, focusing more on just creating shields and energy blasts. In <em>Omniverse</em>, when she gains the Charm of Bezel granting her telekinesis, she reacts in awe like if this was something completely new, even though at this point she has already shown several times she can easily do that of her own.
</li><li> A particularly ridiculous case in the <em>Galactic Monster</em> story arc of <em>Omniverse</em>. Zs'Skayr gets several occasions where he could easily possess Ben and doesn't bother even trying, even though <em>this was the whole point of his goal in all his previous appearance</em>, and, when his mind-controlled minions seize him, struggles using his scythe to get out of their graps even though he has the ability to turn intangible. Later, the climax ends up being a fight between Ghostfreak's minions and Ben's allies, where two characters involved have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Make Me Wanna Shout</a> abilities, one has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Shock and Awe</a> and another has a whole body made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a>. They spend the entire fight brawling like regular humans.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to Fanderson's Chris Bentley for this one - let's take a look at "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxz0QQIPq8">The Legend<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryAnderson">Gerry Anderson</a>'s <em>Lavender Castle</em>, about a spaceship whose crew is searching for the titular pink-ish abode. If you are a spaceship captain and know where the castle can be seen at a specific time, do you a) have your ship fly directly to that location and wait, or b) have them set you down and walk miles to it? If you said a), you are not Captain Thrice. No wonder Anderson didn't care much for the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em>. Dexter often winds up feeling some karmic justice when he involves himself directly in things he could probably just invent his way around (for instance trying to find out what Dee Dee was doing up in the tree; rather than building some kind of spybot that could go up into the tree on his behalf he instead dresses up as a bird and gets himself trapped, giving Dee Dee the pretense necessary to screw around in his lab).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>, Ray Gilette acquires bionic legs early in the fourth season, and on at least one occasion, forgets that he has them when they might come in handy. At one point, this leads to him screwing up his back while trying to lift something heavy, because he had tried to lift with his back.

However, when the Snake Men storm Greyskull later, Snake-Face, for some unfathomable reason, delays using this lethal ability until he goes up against He-Man, choosing to fight Mekanek with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a>. Say what? To drive home the point on how absurd this was, the comic book adaptation changed it, and he <em>did</em> use his gaze on Mek; fortunately, in this case, when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">gaze was reflected back on him</a> by He-Man and he got a taste of his own medicine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">the effect on his victims wore off.</a>

In fact, he <em>never once</em> uses the eye lasers in combat.

</li><li> The Maximals beat the Predacons to the first Stasis Pod and recruit Tigertron to their team by sending a long-range line-of-sight laser transmission from the base, bouncing it off the moon, and to the pod to give the protoform inside the information it needs to scan for a beast mode and emerge as a Maximal. Despite being <em>incredibly</em> effective they never so much as even mention or consider this tactic again, and while it's possible the tactic wouldn't have been effective all those other times you'd think one of them would at least try it as they have nothing to lose anyways, or suggest it, or really anything.

However, Optimus possesses intimate knowledge of Megatron's body because he used to have the same one, so he may have used the vines to disable Megatron's thrusters.
</li><li> Starscream in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> who's quick to transform and blast off whenever threatened. In one instance, when he's surrounded (granted, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyHumans">Puny Humans</a>, but he's just seen their weapons fell an Autobot) and their weapons are charging, he panics and forgets to transform and fly away, which ironically resulted in permanent loss of the ability to transform and take flight.
</li><li> During a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, Arcee and Cliffjumper decide to run into a Space Bridge to escape a collapsing lair, instead of transforming into vehicles and driving towards it. There is an out-of-universe reason for this: the scene takes place on Cybertron when they still turned into their original alien vehicle forms, and the characters were only designed with an Earth-based vehicle mode. But it still makes little sense in-universe.
