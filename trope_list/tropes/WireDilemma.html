The implication is generally that if the wrong wire is cut, the bomb will explode instantly, killing the person disarming it and everyone else in the blast radius. Combines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> with the need to make absolutely sure you're making the right decision for dramatic tension.

</p><ol><li> An aforementioned colored wire isn't there.

</li><li> Cutting the wrong wire doesn't trigger an explosion, but causes the timer to speed up.

</li><li> Lord Il Palazzo has a couple of bombs set in the F City, resulting in the Ropponmatsu androids going and dismantling them — and always failing the Wire Dilemma, resulting in big booms.

Goemon walks up while the rest of the group is paralyzed by the decision, draws his sword and cuts the red wire ("the color of pickled plums" being his justification). It works.

<ul><li> The movie <em>The Time-Bombed Skyscraper</em> ends with this situation, in which Ran (Rachel) has to pick the red or blue wire (which weren't in the schematics they were using until this point). Throughout the whole movie it has been explained that Ran and Shinichi (Jimmy)'s lucky color for the month is red (for this reason, Ran got Shinichi a red sweatshirt for his birthday), so it seems like the correct wire would be the red one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until you realize that Ran actually <em>told the villain who built the bomb</em> about the lucky color thing.

</li><li> The 2-hour special "Trembling Metropolitan Police Headquarters: 12 Million Hostages" has several of these. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Three years prior, one of Sato's colleagues sacrificed his life by <em>not</em> disarming a bomb in order to text Sato a clue to the location of a bomb in a populated area that was given 3 seconds before the bomb went off. This is then subverted by Conan choosing to disarm a bomb in a similar situation before it can go off — he is able to figure out the location of the larger-population bomb from only half the clue.</span>
</li><li> Subverted in the first <em>Detective Conan</em> live-action special, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the culprit made the bomb with all wires the same color so that it could not be disarmed.

Both wires set off the bomb. The real detonator wire is implied to have been concealed behind an earlier booby trap with no dummy wire and is easily disarmed.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe">the mind-reader Mao</a> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnapped Nunnally</span> and has a thousand-pound bomb hanging above her set to go off if time runs out... or if she moves... or if anyone tries to cut the wrong wire... or if anyone tries to cut the <em>right</em> wire at the wrong time... or if Mao decides to just go ahead and detonate it remotely...

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> had Asuma facing a wire dilemma. He was about to cut one wire, when a pair of wire cutters appears from offscreen to cut the other.

Miu disarms it, and a little video of Diego pops up, telling her that he wouldn't make disarming the bomb that easy, and starts the timer. Then she disarms it again...and another video pops up, with Diego mocking her for attempting to disarm the bomb again, and takes another minute off the timer as a penalty. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Miu's grandfather shows up</a>, picks up the bomb, and throws it far enough away that it doesn't do any damage.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a> The Motion Picture</em>, Kaori must choose between six different colored wires.

Barnaby is doing fine cutting the wires to a bomb until he gets to the final two: both the same color, but sticking out from the top and bottom ends of the detonator. He is stuck on which to cut, but in the end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">chooses the "upper" one</a> — as in he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">super-powered</a> partner break the ceiling and <em>kicks</em> the bomb into the air a second before it goes off, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelocatingTheExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelocatingTheExplosion">Relocating the Explosion</a>.

There is an attempt at a more realistic bomb threat scenario where the trickiest parts of disarming the bomb are in fact having to find and open it. There are still more wires than would probably be necessary, and there is mention of how disarming a false timer would set the bomb off, but ultimately the whole thing is resolved without cutting any wires at all.

In this case, the airmen can't shut the bomb down directly because it has been remotely activated, and they have to cut the wiring. The usual dilemma is subverted; the airman disarming the wires briefly hesitates when determining which wire to cut, but he remembers exactly which one to cut after a second of thought. Justified in that they weren't trying to disable the bomb, as they still needed to use it. They just needed to disable the activated timer and stop the Pentagon-ordered detonation. It's also unclear if cutting the wrong wire would cause the bomb to detonate, stop the countdown but render the bomb useless, or just fail to stop the countdown.

Luke and Mara have been trapped in a turbolift and are told that they can't slice their way out with lightsabers, because the power and control cables for both repulsor beams have been wrapped randomly around the turbolift car. Currently it's suspended midway between two Dreadnaughts, but if one is cut the forces will become unbalanced, and the surviving repulsor beam will quickly smash them into a Dreadnaught. They and the people caught in other turbolift cars are supposed to be kept there until their captors disarm the traps and let them out. Luke and Mara get out of this by carefully moving their lightsabers so that they don't quite nick the cables and using their danger sense to discover which wire will shove them up and which one will shove them down. Then they stand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">back to back</a>, mindmeld, strike simultaneously, and sever both at once, cutting both repulsor beams.

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a></em>. The marine doing the disarming is expecting to be told to cut a specific wire but the engineer directing the operation tells him that it's much safer to just grab as many wires as possible and pull them all out with a single yank.
<ul><li> It's also stated that the nukes are specifically designed to go off as soon as the timer is activated in order to prevent anyone from disarming the device after the soldier planting it leaves or decides to have a change of heart.

The wires are, of course, red, white, and blue (the colors of the American flag). Running out of time, with the colors not corresponding to any standard, Nathan cuts the red wire at the last second — bomb defused. When asked why he chose the red wire, Ramsey replies "Because I hate Communists..." (implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeMindsThinkAlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeMindsThinkAlike">the same reasoning the bomber used</a>).
</li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack">Strike Back</a></em>, where a protagonist calls a retired CIA buddy to help disable an active bomb, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but he only called because he knew the friend was terrible under pressure, so he reasoned that whatever wire he told him not to cut was actually the correct wire.</span>

The problem? He's only got orange, yellow, black, and purple wires. Seems the mechanism differs from model to model.

It of course uses the "NO WAIT!" trick, to which she quite reasonably responds "DO NOT TELL ME TO WAIT I AM SITTING ON A TICKING NUCLEAR BOMB".

<ul><li> Subverted when the team discovers blue prints for a bomb in the (dead) bomber's basement. Sam is describing the blue prints to Spike, who's with the bomb, when Sam and Ed start to argue over whether the bomber might have mislabeled things on his own blueprint in order to screw with anyone trying to disarm it. While they argue, Spike effectively disarms the bomb.
</li><li> This trope is subverted pretty much every time the team encounters a bomb. Spike (the team's bomb disposal technician) specifically looks for the wires connected to the detonator, so the color never matters. And that's assuming there are wires to be clipped at all: on one episode, he uses a bomb disposal robot to shoot a water cannon through the detonator, and in another, he has to manually remove the fuse, which is protected by an anti-tampering device. In still other cases, he does have to cut a wire, but the major challenge is not determining which wire, but rather getting to it; in the series finale, for instance, cutting the wires is fairly simple, but he first has to disable an anti-handling device (he uses acetone and dry ice to freeze the sensor).

When Nathan shows up to help, Matt has to read the mind of the D.C. Bomb Squad officer trying to figure out how it works.

</li><li> Another twist in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em> episode, in which Hogan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAdvice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAdvice">cuts the opposite wire of the one Klink picked</a>, on the theory that Klink is always wrong. It's played with even further than that. Originally, Hogan had simply planned to <em>stage</em> one of these situations to use in order to distract Commandant Klink while his crew are up to their usual shenanigans. He simply planned to set up a fake bomb (taking advantage of an air raid that recently happened), and pretend to take his time defusing it until his crew could finish their job. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately played straight though.

With help from an explosives expert on the bus, Hugo was able to cut the right wires, disable the timer and remove it. However, he fails to notice a second timer until about ten seconds before the bomb goes off.
</li><li> A version of this is in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>, where Tim is going to rewire the dishwasher with youngest son Mark watching. After first cutting power at the circuit breaker (maybe; appropriately for the trope he has labeled the breakers in pencil and they've faded), he marvels at the bundle of wires under the appliance and demonstrates that he should first cut the ground wire... if he can figure out which one that is. First he guesses green, then eventually settles on yellow because the sun's yellow and it heats the ground. Snip, zap.

Oh God, that's snakes!") He eventually calls up his son for the mnemonic... and it turns out to be wrong. In the end, the bomb is disposed of by shrinking it to the size of a firecracker.

<ul><li> In the pilot of the reboot, young MacGyver has just jumped off a helicopter into a truck with a bomb in the back, complete with bright red LED countdown and a thing that goes "bleep" in time with it.
<div class="indent"><strong>MacGyver (Voiceover):</strong> Yeah, well, you know how you always have to pick between cutting the blue wire and the red wire? - Yeah? - Well, I've got about 12 wires down here and they're all green. Well, you better pick one quick.

Of course, nobody in their right mind would even <em>consider</em> writing a manual this way. Then the bomb blows up, revealing it to be a propaganda bomb... <em>from their side</em>.

ATF agent Coop defuses the first, but it is affixed to the <em>inside</em> wall of the building, so he has to work THROUGH a small window without being able to see what he's doing. VCTF agent John Grant, who always wanted to be on the bomb squad, panics at trying to defuse the second, mounted on a strut of the building, and it is only after Coop ignores his own bomb to talk John through his that John figures out how to disarm it. Of course, both bombs are disarmed.

Luckily, it's not as bad as it seems, because a perceptive player will have picked up the instructions earlier in the game.

<ul><li> Parodied in the episode "Michelangelo Meets Mondo Gecko". With less than 10 seconds until the stolen bomb detonates, Donatello, without hesitation, cuts the purple wire because it matches his eye mask.
</li><li> In the episode "Convicts From Dimension X" when inter-dimensional criminals trapped the turtles in a force field with a time bomb set up nearby. They freed themselves and Donatello has to decide which wire to pull.
<div class="indent"><strong>Donatello:</strong> I'm just not sure which wire to pull. <br/><strong>Raphael:</strong> What do you mean? It's the red wire! It's always the red one! <br/><strong>Donatello:</strong> You're absolutely right. (<em>pulls blue wire</em>) <br/><strong>Raphael:</strong> What are you doing!? I said the red wire! The red wire! <br/>(<em>timer resets to 1 second</em>) <br/><strong>Raphael:</strong> It stopped. But I said to pull the red wire, not the blue wire! <br/><strong>Donatello:</strong> I know. That's why I didn't pull it. It <em>is</em> always the red wire. They tried to trick us.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> in an episode where Timmy wishes to always be right. In the end where he wishes to be wrong, Cosmo's idea to test it out is to take Timmy to a bomb squad mission and tell him to pick a wire, the idea being that if the bomb explodes, the wish worked, however it got shoved aside in favor of Wanda's idea.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> episode "The Wrath of Dark Kat", Razor needs to defuse a bomb in mid-air. Popping open the hatch while muttering it's always the red wire, he discovers the villain has filled the entire bomb with enough red wires to fully equip a house.
<div class="indent"><strong>Razor:</strong> Okay, piece of cake, just remember, always cut the red wire. <em>[opens the bomb]</em> Oh Dark Kat, you miserable psycho!
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> episode "Wild Cards", the Joker plants a bunch of bombs all over Las Vegas. This being the Joker, the bombs all require a very specific sequence of wire cuts to disarm, which Batman learns and communicates to the rest of the team. The very last bomb is encountered by the Flash. Being the Flash, he can't remember what said sequence of wire cuts is. To make things worse, the Joker keeps messing with him while he tries to figure it out. So he just decides to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">run the damn thing out into the desert</a>. The bombs themselves turn out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a> on part of the Joker, who is filming the whole thing for a TV show and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">is playing with the public's perceptions on how time bombs function</a> to increase suspense. Their confusing layout also helps cover up the fact that several of them are fake and won't detonate either way. Incidentally the colors of the wires match the Justice League members involved: black (Batman), blue (Superman), red (Flash), green (Green Lantern) and yellow-and-black (Hawkgirl).
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtomicBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtomicBetty">Atomic Betty</a></em> Sparky must defuse a bomb while X-5 reads him instructions over a video link. X-5 discovers that cutting any wire will cause the timer to count down faster and says "DO NOT CUT THE WIRES. REPEAT: <strong>DO NOT CUT THE WIRES!</strong>". The video link is bad and both of the "do not" parts of X-5's transmission is cut off, causing Sparky to become frustrated and cut a wire randomly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> had an episode where COBRA-planted earthquake-causing bombs had to be disarmed in this fashion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Tick has to stop an oversized bomb from destroying The Renaissance. He finds a huge mass of wires inside, but after considering the wire problem, he finds an incredibly obvious On/Off switch instead.
</li><li> The episode "The Idea Men", where The Tick fails at disarming the bomb and ends up running it outside its intended blast zone to a place where it can't harm anyone (it detonates in <em>his</em> face, but The Tick is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>'s "Brian Does Hollywood" fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> intro.
<div class="indent"><strong>Meg:</strong> What do you mean, cut the blue wire?! THEY'RE <em>ALL</em> BLUE WIRES!
</div></li><li> One episode of the US-made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> cartoon has a scene where Guile tries to defuse a bomb, but comes up short and simply decides to Sonic Boom it. Miraculously, this actually defuses the bomb. While it's not clear whether the writers put that much thought into it, depending on just how the Sonic Boom works and the type of explosives involved, this might have worked if the circuitry was destroyed before triggering the bomb.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask">The Mask</a></em> has the Mask trying to shut off a nuclear bomb on motion by cutting its wires. Doesn't work. Cue Plan B: cover the bomb in bread and fillings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">eat it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>:
<ul><li> First the bomb expert directs Archer and Lana to cut the blue and white striped wire... except there are two of them, and they can't tell which one is blue with white stripes and which one is white with blue stripes. Then, after checking the serial number of the bomb, Archer is directed to cut the green wire... except the bomb expert misheard the last letter of the serial number, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongWire">cutting the green wire speeds up the detonation.</a> Eventually they just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">dump out the bomb from the airship</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Onto a populated area</a>.

</div></li><li> Subverted in a later episode when Archer calls him about disarming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self-destruct</a> bomb wired to his mother's safe:
<div class="indent"><strong>Archer:</strong> Hey Ray, I'm sending you a picture of a bomb, which wires do I— <br/><strong>Ray:</strong> Blue and yellow. <br/><strong>Archer:</strong> Seriously? You don't want to take a minute to look at it. <br/><strong>Ray:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">I wired the damn thing!</a>

He tells them it's the orange wire, and Jonny relies this information to his father, who, along with Race, is in a sealed chamber full of said nerve gas with only seconds to spare before their protective suits start failing. Right before Dr. Quest is about to snip the wire, Race interrupts, telling him to cut the blue wire instead. Benton does, and the day is saved. It's the one time Jonny's glad his father didn't listen to him. To elaborate, Surd had a personal grudge against Race, and wanted the bomb to go off in his face for revenge.
</li><li> While not a bomb, one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> had Dexter cutting wires in one of his inventions, with help from a now genius Dee-Dee. While he goes to cut the wires she hints they are wrong until they get to the last one, which Dexter states has to be correct via process of elimination and cuts it. It's wrong. Dee-Dee then reveals they were all the wrong wires.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>:
<ul><li> A variation happens after Iron Man/Tony Stark falls victim to an alien virus. In order to revive Tony, Maria Hill has to repair his arc reactor, and has to do so quickly enough so that his heart wouldn't stop. While guiding Maria, Tony passes out before he could point out the last wire to bypass. Maria decides to guess which of two wires she should bypass, and miraculously, Tony regains consciousness after she performs her guess.
</li><li> Another variation comes when Spider-Man has to deactivate Kang's time portal. JARVIS tells Spidey that the machine relies on Kang's "intuition," so Spidey decides to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> to figure out which power cell he <em>shouldn't</em> remove.
</li></ul></li><li> This conundrum was featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama Action</a></em>, however the yellow wire isn't the correct wire for most of the contestant's bombs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgers">Duck Dodgers</a></em>: Dodgers once has to disarm a bomb set by someone who, believing Dodgers would follow the cliché of cutting the red wire, set it to explode once it was cut. Dodgers, not knowing the red wire custom, cut the blue one, disarming the bomb. His would-be killer, furious Dodgers wouldn't cut the red wire as per tradition, does it instead.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeDinosaurs">Extreme Dinosaurs</a></em> smart guy Stegz is faced with a bomb that has multiple multi-colored wires and decides to just rip them all out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dogstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dogstar">Dogstar</a></em>: In "The Greening of Gavin", Lincoln instructs Fenwick on how to disarm the Tesla cannon and tells her to cut the red wire. Fenwick then points out that both wires are red and asks what idiot would do that. Lincoln looks embarrassed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em>: The episode "Dan Vs. Baseball" has a b-plot that culminates in Elise deactivating a nuclear warhead. She has less than a minute left before it detonates, and she has to choose between cutting an orange wire or a green one... and she can't concentrate because her husband Chris picks then, of all times, to phone her. So she asks him which of those colors is his favorite (without telling him the reason for the question) then cuts that wire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> Rubberband Man has to defuse a bomb. The directions are literally written on the bomb. Problem is that he can't read the instructions due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his dyslexia, which he never got help for and which is exacerbated by the stress of the bomb</span>. The final step is to rotate the detonator, but he can't figure out which way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He reasons that the word is too long to be "clockwise", and so rotates it counterclockwise. He's right.</span>

In "Save the Whale", Cassie can't make a decision when confronted with the two wires.

<ul><li> During the Second World War, some bombs dropped over Britain by the Luftwaffe intentionally featured such designs, on the logic that simply blowing up a building causes trouble, but calling out the bomb squad could drive an entire town to a standstill. In fact, the later generations of bombs were designed to blow up when the disposal tech tried to follow the correct instructions for disarming the previous generation of bomb. It was only when the UXB teams got lucky and found a few duds of those models that they could safely take apart to figure out what the new extra disarming steps were that this stopped happening. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that some of these German designs had been registered in the London Patent Office before the war, but that nobody thought to look there.
</li><li> Lewis Page, a writer for The Register, trained in bomb disposal. He remarks in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/02/terror_idiocy_outbreak/">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he and his colleagues were originally trained to defuse bombs made by people who knew what they were doing, and actually had to be re-trained out of their paranoia about dummy wires, etc, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">they were more usually called out to deal with "bombs" made by the sort of people who probably have difficulty wiring a plug</a>.
</li><li> Because of this trope the preferred method of dealing with bombs is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelocatingTheExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelocatingTheExplosion">relocate them to a bomb range</a> (or at least somewhere that damage will be minimal) and then just setting them off.
