The child will feel the pain and misery of your (often ridiculously benign) neglect as he looks in the audience and sees you aren't there.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, Waku tells Moji that he used to play soccer, but his father never showed up for the tournament he was in, so he began to question why he was doing it and decided to take a break from it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At his funeral</span>, his father admits to having been burdened with work. In the manga, Aiko "Anko" Tokiosumi's father Akira is one as a news reporter, and it's revealed that she had once hoped to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> to see him on TV.

<ul><li> Sonomi Daidouji, Tomoyo's mother. Like Dr. Mizuno, Sonomi's always very busy with her business and barely has time to see Tomoyo, but is genuinely affectionate to her and her friends when she <em>is</em> around. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Specially seen in the episode where Tomoyo temporarily becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">Cute Mute</a> due to a Clow Card stealing her voice</span>.
</li><li> Sakura's father Fujitaka is a milder example, as he's an archeologist and uni professor with a very heavy schedule.
</li></ul></li><li> Fans often think this is the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, though Gohan has never shown much if any anger for his father not being there more for him. This is probably because his absences are usually with good reason, and he spends as much time as he can with his family when he <em>is</em> around. His first absence of one year is because he dies saving Gohan, and stays in the afterlife to train so he can protect the Earth from the Saiyan threat. The next time, he crash-lands on a distant planet following his fight with Frieza, and only declines to return to Earth immediately because he is in the midst of learning an incredibly useful technique - he returns of his own accord a year and a half later. His longest separated time (seven years) was due to him sacrificing himself to prevent Cell from destroying Earth, and believing that if he stayed dead there would be no more foes (like Frieza or Cell). Despite this, he ends up returning and staying until he had to leave to teach his successor - which doesn't prevent him from visiting often if Neko Majin Z will have us believe. Least to say, neither of Goku's sons are in any way resentful for this and Chichi ends up understanding (but still doesn't cease to worry).
</li><li> Shun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Endride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Endride">Endride</a></em> is rather more proactive than most, so when his dad doesn't come home for his own birthday, Shun goes to his office to drag him back home. Ironically, the tables are turned when this leads to his getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a>, with his parents now probably missing him.
</li><li> Tsubomi's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> <em>had</em> this problem, being well-respected botanists and always off on business trips until Tsubomi had an emotional breakdown, forcing them to realize that they were destroying their family. They quickly quit their jobs and move to Kibogahana so they can be with Tsubomi's grandmother and be a family again, which kicks off the story.
</li><li> Tsugawa's family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JapanInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JapanInc">Japan, Inc.</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetTwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetTwinkle">Jewelpet Twinkle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Miria has parents who're famous in the music business, and so they spend the majority of time away from home, making Miria feel lonely. It was during one of these periods of angst that she met her Jewelpets.
</li><li> Sara also has scientist parents who went abroad when she was a kid. The only news she gets of them is when they send gifts.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Jotaro Kujo</a>'s father, who wasn't around often, due to being a jazz musician that was frequently on tour. Not that Jotaro seems to resent him for this, but he clearly didn't understand that most people need a dad while growing up. This affects his and his daughter Jolyne's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Stone Ocean</a></em>, as he just sort of assumed that she would inherently know that his near-constant absence was to keep her and her mother out of the Stand-related trouble he regularly dealt with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LittleHouseWithAnOrangeRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LittleHouseWithAnOrangeRoof">Little House with an Orange Roof</a></em>: This is one of the catalysts for the premise; to keep the soulless corporation from firing him, the series' "dad" spends every waking moment working.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella">Magic of Stella</a></em>, Tamaki's father's jobs require him to only available at home <em>one weekend a month</em>.

</li><li> This is the tragic backstory of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Precia Testarossa</a></span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaTheMovieFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaTheMovieFirst">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha The MOVIE 1st</a></em>. The sad part is, she did know that this was a problem and tried her best to make time for her daughter, but unlike the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a> in the series who managed to balance their work and family life, she got smacked with the double whammy of a demanding job <em>and</em> unreasonable higher-ups. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unsurprisingly, when her daughter died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FondMemoriesThatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FondMemoriesThatCouldHaveBeen">before she could make up for lost time</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert">said higher-ups ignored her expert warnings about her project</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">her mind broke</a></span>.
</li><li> Lunge from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> is this to the extent that his wife and daughter actually leave him. He doesn't particularly care at the time (that is how much he is obsessed with his work), but at the end of the story shows a desire to reconnect with his daughter.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">sequel series</a>, Boruto Uzumaki seems to have this relationship with his father Naruto. He spends a lot of time playing pranks mostly as an effort to get his dad's attention since he's too busy being the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seventh Hokage</span>. While Naruto perhaps means well, it is shown that he barely knows anything about his son and has burned up much of Boruto's goodwill towards him, leading his eldest child to openly disrespect both him and his title of Hokage. Even when Naruto attempts to spend time with Boruto, it mostly revolves around things Naruto himself preferred as a child, such as taking Boruto out for ramen. Sadly, the man who once declared that "I never go back on my word, it's my ninja way!" seems to either be stretched too thin or just not understand his responsibility to his children. Boruto is particularly enraged when he feels he received a promise from Naruto to be at Himawari's birthday celebration, only for Naruto to send a clone...and one that dispels while carrying Himawari's cake. Needless to say, Boruto is NOT pleased with Naruto. His younger sister Himawari doesn't have this issue and is more accepting of their father's job.

In the end, the magic mirror projects her childhood and reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father was more openly affectionate and around her more, leading to a twist on this trope of the child ultimately coming to realize that the father's workaholic tendencies are out of love and are necessary to support her, and she learns to accept it and to start loving him just the way he is</span>.

A major source of friction between the Joneses Sr. and Jr. is that Sr. wasn't around much when Indy was a kid. The young Indy was frequently neglected as a child because his father was always off hunting relics.

Moreover, in both cases, it seems as if it's not that their jobs are particularly time-consuming so much as they're mildly disinterested in the children and willing to palm their parental responsibilities off on someone else. Then again, this was completely normal for a well-off family in the Edwardian Era.
<ul><li> The kids get an aesop on the subject as well; just because their parents aren't around as much as they'd like doesn't mean they don't love them. They also learn that being a grown-up and providing for a family is very hard, and you shouldn't be too hard in judging them.

The father never seems to have time for his kid, making empty promises to spend time with him, and despite all that, his kid continues to look up to his dad, promising that he'll grow up to be just like him. When the dad is retired and finally has time for his son, he finds that his son is now the workaholic that has no time for him. (Though the son's mentions of his own children suggest he's trying to do right by them this time around.)

</li><li> John Anderson's "I Wish I Could Have Been There" is similar in storyline to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> (a father who's always on the road, thus missing his daughter's birth and son's first home run). It then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverts</a> the usual path on the last verse, where the son and daughter are now grown up, and say the same thing to their parents when they are unable to make their parents' anniversary.

</li><li> "Father and Son" by Cat Stevens is an inversion, being more of a "Why You Leaving Home, Son?"

<div class="indent">First thing I remember was askin' Papa "Why?" / For there were many things I didn't know. <br/>And Daddy always smiled; took me by the hand / Sayin', "Someday you'll understand." <br/>Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son <br/>You'd better learn it fast, you'd better learn it young <br/>'Cause, "Someday" never comes.

</div></li><li> The song "Don't Miss Your Life" by Phil Vassar was written when the singer was on a plane missing his daughters. It's about a young man on a plane for a business trip, sitting next to an older man who tells him he's missed a lot such as his daughter's first steps, and who advises him "don't miss your life". By the end of the song, the young man decides that as soon as the plane lands, he'll buy a ticket back home so that he can be there for his daughter's eighth birthday.
<div class="indent">I missed the first steps my daughter took <br/>The time my son played Captain Hook <br/>In Peter Pan, I was in New York <br/>Said "Sorry, son, Dad has to work" <br/>I missed the father-daughter dance <br/>The first home run, no second chance <br/>To be there when he crossed the plate <br/>The moment's gone, now it's too late <br/>Fame and fortune come with a heavy price <br/>Son, don't miss your life.

</li><li> Chapter eight of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terra">Terra</a></em> opens in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashback</a> of Rick MacFarlane in the last stages of getting ready to go on deployment, only to discover that his daughter (10-ish) has gone so far as to steal his ID to keep him from leaving. He was apparently supposed to help her finish a model kit of some kind. And then since it's a flashback, we know that after this, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighter</a> gets shot down and he and his pilot Alex are stranded a ways across the galaxy with no easy way home.

Stepmother Delia is a self-absorbed artist, which is no loss, but Lydia's father Charles is genuinely kind and loving; he just works ridiculous hours, which leads to things like missing his daughter's birthday. It's part of why she's such a loner.

Charlie accuses Terror of never spending any time with him when he was a child. Terror says he had to work, but also because Charlie was such a goody-two-shoes, Terror didn't WANT to spend any time with him. For reference, Charlie became an insurance agent instead of a supervillain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, Jake becomes the father to a litter of dog-rainicorn pups. However, his status as an adventuring hero means he's rarely around to see them. It doesn't help that the pups have reached adulthood in weeks, so all of Jake's attempts to bond come off as hopelessly immature and childish. One of them even tried to buy out Jake's house and force him to take a more "serious" job.

Mrs Fillyjonk convinces Moominpapa that his lack of a job is a bad influence on Moomintroll, so he decides to set up a business offering boat tours (but, since this is Moominpapa, only in storms). As far as Moomintroll is concerned, all this means is that Moominpapa isn't at home any more.
