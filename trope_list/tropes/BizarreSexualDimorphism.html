Women are shorter, have wider hips, and have larger breasts. This is because we are <em>sexually dimorphic</em> animals. Sexual dimorphism refers to the differences between the sexes other than their sex organs.
</p><p>This is also the case in several other animal species, particularly those who also rely mostly on vision, and communicate largely with visual displays. The most common kind of dimorphism is when males and females of the same species sport different colors and markings.
</p><p>Then there are a few species (relatively speaking) in which males and females look wildly different. One sex may even have an entire physical feature that the other lacks (other than, you know, the obvious ones)  if the other sex doesn't sport his/her <em>own</em> trademark physical feature. In a <em>very</em> few species, males and females may be different enough to look like completely different animals (really by the standards of the animal kingdom, human sexual dimorphism is very slight  the range of characteristics between males and females in the human species has substantial overlap).

There are several alien or fantastical creatures in which the sexes are wildly different. This tends to run towards the extreme end of the Earth scale and beyond: they could be greatly unequal in strength or intelligence; one sex could even be reduced to an inert breeding machine or parasite like certain species of insects and fish.

<ul><li> Discussed early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Soon after meeting, Bulma discovers that Goku's tail is real, and he rationalizes it by claiming that she doesn't have a tail because she's a girl. She briefly admits to herself that he might be right, as she's never actually seen a boy naked, but thought it was just "that other thing". Goku then mentions that his grandfather Gohan didn't have a tail, though he immediately qualified it by saying that he was a really strange guy.
</li><li> This <em>appeared</em> to be the case for the plants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, with the girls in bulbs with the big strange eyes and all, and the only two guys walking around looking like blond men. But later manga material shows that Vash and Knives really are different because they're mutants (probably throwbacks; the odds that the people who engineered the plants didn't use human DNA are vanishingly small), because some female independents come from space; the twins are just even weirder. Although, some like Cronica who appears at the end of the story, she looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a>, pale skin, blonde hair and is beautiful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SetonAcademyJoinThePack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SetonAcademyJoinThePack">Seton Academy: Join the Pack!</a></em> is a world of talking animals. The males of any species are just upright, talking animals. The females are portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">Kemonomimi</a>. Which can lead to odd sights like a regular sized schoolgirl and a colony of talking naked mole rats.

The Zamarons were later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> to have always <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zamaron.jpg">been blue-skinned, black-eyed, hairless, and almost noseless<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (think tall, blue, female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Roswell Greys</a>). And they are still almost three times the size of the Guardians, so the trope still applies, since the two are either the same species or offshoots of the same species, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
<ul><li> The small size of the Guardians compared to the Zamorians <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Krona</span> was revealed to be caused by specific bandage wraps that the guardians used for restoration. Once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Krona</span> used them, he looked just like the Guardians. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He also attempted to use them on Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner into guardians... somehow.</span>
</li><li> Even more confusingly, there are <em>also</em> female Guardians who look like Guardians. They originally came to be when Kyle Rayner (possessing at the time the godlike powers of Ion) recreated the Guardians years after Hal Jordan (at the time possessed by evil entity Paralax) wiped them all out. Of course in the current series all this is ignored and the Guardians are shown in flashbacks to have been always both sexes.
</li><li> There are also the Controllers, who were also the same species as the Guardians/Zamarons, but appear to be tall, bald humanoid men with orange skin. It's safe to say that the whole species is just <em>weird</em>.

In some continuities, female Dryads look like large masculine-seeming humanoids made of crystal. (In others they look like the male dryads with narrower waists and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries">Non-Mammal Mammaries</a>.)
</li><li> In the pre-Crisis version of the Vega system, one world's male inhabitants look very much like humans. The females look like giant snails. To quote the gamebook, "This seems to work for them."
</li><li> Used as a twist ending in Alan Moore's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OmegaMen">Omega Men</a></em> backup story "Vega: A Man's World" — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the enormous grazing mollusks the all-male Culacoans "hunt" are actually stimulated to produce new males when prodded hard enough in a certain area, and split into two new females after seemingly dying. The difference in mating rituals is so vast that when Mopi tries to help a foreign anthropologist understand "gamugha", he innocently kills her with his spear</span>.

The ambulatory Rykornian males are small rhombus shaped beings with pyramid shaped heads, four thin leaf-like limbs and corn-silk like "hair" on their faces.

</p><ul><li> The Badoon, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a></em> alien race, have scaly reptilian males and fur-covered females. The females are also stronger and tougher, but less violent and cunning than the males, and the sexes don't interact except during their once-in-a-lifetime mating frenzy. The females also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries">Non-Mammal Mammaries</a>, despite laying eggs, though it's possible that they do suckle their young.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RomSpaceKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RomSpaceKnight">ROM: Space Knight</a>'s</em> enemies the Dire Wraiths come in two flavors: the technology-using males, who look like ugly, fanged, gangly-limbed Pillsbury Doughboys; and the sorcery-using females, who are pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a>.

Females are malicious and voracious little monsters that must consume 50 times their own body weight in food on a daily basis, preferring meat, whilst males are docile, passive, and virtually sessile due to suffering from hemochromatosis. Females are much more common than males, and are the sexual aggressors in mating; males usually don't even feel the female copulating with them. After mating, the female gnaws her way inside of the male's body and consumes him from the inside out to feed her growing brood, leaving behind a hollow, porcelain-like husk that rapidly crumbles into dust. The pregnant female becomes massively swollen with eggs, and when she is near her term, her fellow females with violently kill her, stabbing her before disemboweling her to release the eggs into the wind, where they will promptly hatch into tiny infant fairies — at this stage, males are also winged. Most of the larval faeries will be eaten by birds or other predators, with the survivors growing up to repeat the cycle.

This is very similar to real-life insects, especially parasitic wasps, glow-worms, and lubber grasshoppers.
</li><li> A straight example occurs in the unmade Godzilla film <em>Godzilla vs. Redmoon</em>, where two kaiju appeared named Redmoon (a sort of dragon-like monster) and Erabus (a wingless monster with a vaguely horse-like face).

Indeed, it's often hard to tell if the terms "male" and "female" even apply; many species are functionally hermaphroditic, and mating impregnates both individuals. The closest thing would be the female <a class="urllink" href="http://waynebarlowe.wordpress.com/artwork/expedition/">Sacback<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who lives her adult life buried underground as her male counterpart roams around finding food for her.

(The blatant sexism and classism is a satire of the attitudes that people actually had when it was written, as explained in a foreword added by Abbot when people missed this.) Other details of their physiology, including how they reproduce, are never explained. In <em>Flatterland</em> (a 2001 sequel by Ian Stewart), it is implied that the females utilize the males in detaching a segment after sometimes folding the segment into a new shape with roughly the same number of sides as the male. The females are also confirmed to be multi-sided beings that are rotated into a third dimension, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">which just brings up even more questions, including already-answered questions, the answers to which were suddenly made invalid</a>.

They begin life as sexless, snakelike animals, then choose which adult sex to metamorphose into when their consciousness and race-memory emerges. Mating takes place at the ocean's surface, aside from which the two sexes never interact.

However, ancient Kzinti females <em>were</em> entirely sapient—their current state is the result of intentional breeding for unintelligent women, with the help of genetic engineering technology. That's what happens when you uplift a bronze age species. Strangely enough, Kzinti (in Man-Kzin Wars) consider the human sexes to be separate alien species, based on behavioral differences. A human female (Manrrett) is considered to have apparently faster reflexes, higher pain tolerance, and greater intellectual insight, than a human male (Man).
</li><li> The Puppeteers, who are already fairly strange-looking, are a subversion. What they refer to as "females" are actually a different, non-sentient species with its own males and females; true Puppeteers are parasitoids, with both sexes sporting similar-looking genitalia used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong">deposit gametes in the flesh of a host "female"</a>.

Young females are something like alien bulldogs, and young males are akin to chihuahua, neither of which are sapient. Adults telepathically control the young into breeding, and use the same telepathy to force prey animals to leap into their mouths, since giant immobile cones aren't good at hunting.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> inverts the trope with the dwarf race, with it being stated that female dwarves are often mistaken for men due to being similar to the males in voice and appearance. As every male dwarf we encounter in the book has a prominent beard, some readers have interpreted this as meaning that the female dwarves even have beards.
</li><li> In the films, this became a rather comedic scene where Gimli humorously explains this phenomenon to a human woman. The human woman (Éowyn) then turns around and looks at Aragorn to see if Gimli is pulling her leg, and he mouths, "It's the beards," and gestures at his chin. A few female Dwarfs in the crowd scenes of the Hobbit movies show a great variety of facial hair, anywhere from a thin fuzz or trimmed muttonchops to full braided beards.
</li><li> Confirmed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, which says "For the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike."

As males slept for most of the year, whereas females remained awake to nurse their young except in the depths of winter, the sedentary males wound up having a lifespan several times as long as that of the nomadic females.
</li><li> <em>Medea: Harlan's World</em> was a collaboration between a number of major SF writers to create a single setting, and a series of short stories set on the titular moon. In "Flare Time" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>, the reproductive cycle of the native sentients known as fuxes is described. They start off as six-legged females. At around seven they have their first litter, during which their rear body segment tears off, leaving them as four-legged females. The hindquarters contain the eggs, and function as a nest which the newborns eat their way out of. Around seventeen they have a second litter, leaving them as two-legged <em>males</em>, with the male organs exposed through the loss of the second body segment. The male guards the nest until the young are born, then goes into heat for about three years, and eventually ends up a "post-male".

The males are lizard-like, and can speak fairly well. The women are more bird-like, with feathers and a beak which limits their ability to speak human languages—which is why most humans aren't aware they're intelligent, let alone the same species.
</li><li> In Dennis L. McKiernan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mithgar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mithgar">Mithgar</a></em> series, dragons are the male of a species. What are the females? Of all things, krakens!
<ul><li> Dwarves are interesting. Only the males are seen by outsiders. Anyone that visits a Dwarvenholt that is considered friendly might catch a glimpse of a veiled, graceful figure that swiftly departs, said to be a "Chakkia" (the dwarves call themselves Chak). One character caught a glimpse of a Chakkia without the veils: she was beautiful. Another character, able to see the "true form" or <em>light</em> of living things, stated that he did not believe the Chakkia to be dwarves at all, their <em>light</em> was too different.
</li><li> In another book, a seer also commented (to herself) that they were clearly <em>not</em> the same species as the male dwarves, then recognised them as... something else that she wouldn't tell us about, wondered if their state was some sort of divinely ordered punishment, and then claimed it was none of her business and turned away. If he keeps writing enough books he MAY explain all this.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadoxTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadoxTrilogy">Paradox Trilogy</a></em>, the xith'cal have genetically engineered themselves so that males and females are specialized for different tasks. Males are much larger and serve as warriors, while females are smaller and serve as scientists. Maturing xith'cal are able to choose which gender they will become, and may even decide to remain genderless, though doing so is uncommon.

A male will be born with one of twelve different sex organs, females one of fourteen. Each type matches one or more of the others. Mating is complicated by the great secrecy surrounding sex: no-one wants to be "outed" as a particular sex since there are a host of restrictive sexual stereotypes waiting to be applied.

The alien is apparently used to sexual dimorphisms extreme enough to make this plausible, and doesn't notice the difference between human males and females, except to suggest that the human with the large protrusions on his (actually "her") upper thorax might want to see a doctor about it.

Especially the piggies. The buggers are about as sexually dimorphic as real bugs. Both species call <em>humans</em> weird for having sexes so similar that both can perform the same societal function.
<ul><li> The piggies' life cycle and reproduction is strange enough that it really deserves to be explained in full detail (though put in spoilers). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both sexes start out small and grublike, but the dimorphism starts quickly. The males develop into the pig-like form that the humans in the story first assume were the only form, but will develop into enormous trees upon death and retain their sentience upon <em>being ritually vivisected</em>. <br/><br/>The females, on the other hand, almost all stay small and grublike, and after a certain time are carried by the pig-like males to the trees, and are <em>impregnated by said trees</em> via pollen. Then, when the young they're carrying are ready to be born, they <em>eat their way out of their mother</em>. In addition, the occasional female will develop into a pig-like form like the males to serve as a matriarch, and eventually also be vivisected to become a "mothertree", which holds all the young and nourishes them with its sap.</span> "Bizarre sexual dimophism" doesn't even <em>begin</em> to cover it.
</li><li> There's also the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> apparently female-only deer-like creatures that are impregnated by the grass-like male half of the species</span>. The xenobiologists spend half the book puzzled over evidence of genetic exchange (which implies the species don't reproduce by parthenogenesis like some <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Grassland_Whiptail_Lizard">earth species<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> do), yet without any apparent presence of males.

That or bestiality. The cause for this appears to be an ancient cataclysm that affected all known races, causing many of the bizarre biological and psychological features of the aliens.
<ul><li> In <em>Today, Mom</em> there are genetically engineered sphinxes: lion-sized sentient beings created to survive on Venus to terraform it to human-habitable conditions. The males were working on Venus, the females were kept hidden on Earth. One day males revolted, declared independence and smuggled females to Venus.

In the second book, it's revealed (to the readers, not the characters) that the "spider-like" Agletsch are, in fact, their females.

Merrows are hideous but friendly to humans, as long as said humans don't try to steal their wives. Of course, mermaids are hot, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">humans try to steal their wives a lot, actually,</a> thus incurring the merrows' wrath.

A gynosphinx mating with a hieraco- or criosphinx always produces hieraco- or criosphinxes as offspring, while if mating with an androsphinx they produce twins, one of which is a gynosphinx and the other an androsphinx. This means that, for obvious reasons, gynosphinxes don't like mating with crio- or hieracosphinxes much, which means that the other two reproduce pretty much entirely through <em>rape</em>. Androsphinxes on the other hand don't like mating much at all, and it is noted that gynosphinxes will pay adventurers handsomely for the location of an androsphinx. In other words, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> monsters are screwed up — and very likely going extinct, if gynosphinxes aren't having enough daughters to replace themselves each generation.
</li><li> There are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">medusae</a>, depending on edition:
<ul><li> Played straight in 2e, where the females have snakes instead of hair, with 10% being poison-blooded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Snake People</a> for added measure, and the males, called maedars, look more-or-less like bald human men. They also differ in terms of powers; females have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">petrifying gaze</a>, whilst males can walk through stone like it was air, are strong enough to smash rock with their bare fists with ease, and they can do <em>Stone to Flesh</em> by touch at will, unlimited applications per day. They use these two abilities to smash petrified creatures to bits (killing them) then convert the bits back to flesh for food. Needless to say, although they can breed with human men instead, medusae very much want one for a mate.
</li><li> The 3rd edition core setting basically states that medusae are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> claims that male medusae exist and, apart from the mammalian gender differences, are identical to females.
</li><li> Played down in 4e, where male medusae are bald and have a venomous gaze, but are otherwise clearly related to female medusae, just like human men and women.
</li><li> 5th edition takes the Eberron route; medusae come in male and female genders, both look like beautiful examples of their sex with snakes for hair, and both have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">petrifying gaze</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In a non-canon third-party sourcebook, <em>The Slayer's Guide to Troglodytes</em> from Mongoose Publishing, the titular lizard-people are made up of sapient humanoid males and non-sapient females that look like huge bloated lizards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em>: One of the first of the popular "Ecology of the ___" articles applied this trope to the catoblepas, a long-necked buffalo-like monster ugly enough to kill anything that sees its face. An in-Verse naturalist reveals the solution to how such a deadly-to-approach creature can mate: the infamous quadruped is actually the <em>female</em> of the species, which grazes on water weeds in marshland. The male, a harmless bipedal grass-eater, spends most of the year on dry ground, but in breeding season he enters the marshes, locates a female by her scent, waits until she's dipped her lethally-hideous head underwater to graze, mates <em>very quickly</em> and then runs like hell. Offspring remain immune to the females' death attack just long enough to be weaned.
</li></ul></li><li> Humanoid cat warriors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> have, apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidFemaleAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidFemaleAnimal">breasts and hip shapes</a>, one weird trait of sexual dimorphism: most female members are leopards or jaguars, while most male members are lions or tigers. The only exceptions are black panther warriors whose males and females are all black panthers (in real life, black panthers are actually just leopards or jaguars), and Leonins whose members are all lions.
</li><li> Steamlogic's <em>Mechanical Dreams</em> has the Laudoling. The males are upright human-sized creatures that look like a mosquito got crossbred with a satyr while the female is a gigantic quadruped that looks a bit like a giant scorpion with no tail or pincers and a round helmet-like head. It's been speculated amongst academics, that the Laudoling were originally two different species (male Laudolings can mate with any living thing and the resulting offspring is almost always the mother's species, though some matings result in a male Laudoling offspring).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong">Myriad Song</a></em> Rhax females look like roughly human sized spiders with two or four limbs adapted into arms, males look exactly like spiders that never get larger than a meter across and aren't sapient.

<ul><li> Sphinxes. The gynosphinx produces offspring based on the emotional rapport she had with their sire. Encounters done for pure lustful pleasure produce crinosphinxes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> produces gynosphinxes and androsphinxes, and hatred or resentment produces hieracosphinxes — which means they pretty much only occur as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>. Unfortunately for gynosphinxes, they are naturally lusty, whilst androsphinxes are pretty apathetic towards sex, meaning that even if they do get an androsphinx to bed them, they're more likely to produce crinosphinxes than anything. Reading between the lines, the genuine affection and commitment that crinosphinxes show towards gynosphinxes means they are probably <em>more</em> likely to produce gynosphinx and androsphinx offspring, if the gynosphinx can get over her ego and learn to respect them back.
</li><li> The Ceratoidi are Anglerfish-style Fish Men, Or rather Fish Women. Like the real anglerfish below, the female is the one most see, while males are the size of a rat, and attach themselves to the female.
</li><li> Two classic RPG monsters, the trapper and the lurker above, were re-imagined for this game as the female and male (respectively) of a single species, the "lurking ray". The smaller, non-sentient males become capable of flight as they mature, allowing them to seek out the heavier, flightless, intelligent females. On top of that, juveniles of the species are <em>Pathfinder's</em> re-imagining of a <em>third</em> stock fantasy monster, the executioner's hood. Which makes sense, as they too hunt by wrapping around and smothering/crushing prey.

No canon source bears this out. On the live-action shows, no males are seen until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em> and they're all green. Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> sources present Orions as having a range of skin colors, but pretty much universally present males and females as having the same range of colors, which generally doesn't include gold. The one time their men were shown on the show they were basically the extreme of human dimorphism, all being huge and heavily muscled males or smaller and lithe females.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta">Talislanta</a></em> game does this with not one, but two species:
<ul><li> In the first example, the stooped, wrinkled females are Gnorls and the gangly, monkey-like males are Weirdlings. The former live in elaborate cavern homes, while the latter live in simple burrows; they inhabit different regions, but come together every 50 years or so to mate. Both sexes were named separately by outsiders, who'd thought they were different races at the time, and no Gnorl <em>or</em> Weirdling will admit what (if anything) they call their mutual species.
</li><li> In the second example, female Batreans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">Green Skinned Space Babes</a>, complete with hyper-seductive pheromones, while their male counterparts are grotesque, hulking ogre-ish creatures. The females are intelligent and live in Polynesian-style villages, while the moronic males shamble around in the jungle, looking for edible things to hit.
</li></ul></li><li> The Skaven of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> fantasy take this to extreme of the females being non-sapient and even more rat-like than the males — "breeders", as they are called, basically look like Ogre-sized or larger female non-anthropomorphic rats, made even bigger by the fact they are swollen so huge with litters that they can't walk. The last Codex seemed to show that there are normal-sized sapient females.

The males reach heights of over seven feet tall, have very sharp features, scales all over their body, gigantic horns where their ears should be, longer tails and very aggressive body language. By contrast, the females barely reach five feet tall, have slender, dainty builds and soft faces with a difference in the number and placement of scale patches, smoother horns that curve back away from their head, shorter tails, and a much softer body language.
<ul><li> The Roegadyn are a less pronounced version, but still stand out against other races. While the males and females of other races have rather similar builds (minus obvious breasts on Hyuran, Elezen, and Miqo'tean females), Roegadyn males are clearly about three times as heavy as the females. Females have a mild Amazon build, but males are still about twice as wide, with arms thicker and more muscular than a female's leg.

The males are about four to five feet tall, dexterous, hardy, and generally warriors; the females are six to seven feet tall, considerably more intelligent and charismatic, and much slower/bulkier due to their thoraxes.

Male Ranger Androids, RAcasts, resemble human-sized typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mecha</a> designs with bulky bodies and stylized mechanical faces - if they can even be called faces.

The male and female Hunter Androids though, HUcasts and HUcaseals, avert this however, with both looking very humanoid in design. Future games in the series give many more options to make completely humanoid android characters of both male and female variety, as well as less humanoid females, though there is still an imbalance in which there are more mecha-style male options than there are female, and the default models used for promotional materials and when starting character creation still follow the same male/female styles as PSO's.

The one female shown looks considerably more human-like with small horns and small enough to ride on the shoulder of a male. It's unknown if this is true for the Kuronites who also inhabit planet Harkotan but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> considering the female was actually half Shironian half Kuronite it's likely to be the case as due to the two races being at war but both accepting her as the planet's leader it's unlikely that one side would have accepted her if she looked more like the other. This would make it worse in the Kuronite's case as they can be over 30 ft tall. Kuronites also vary heavily in body structure ranging from vaguely humanoid to centaurs to creatures with only one leg to a gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. But all in-game texts suggests all the Kuronites are the same species</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are a number of species that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">gender-exclusive</a> (Jynx, for example, is only female). But some of these Pokémon are considered the opposite sex of a different "species." Notably (and most obviously) Nidorino and Nidorina<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00d8r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note00d8r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00d8r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Nidoran lines' status as this is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>, as they were introduced before the formal introduction of sexes in the games, but it would have been too much of a hassle to renumber the National Dex to accommodate them</span> but also Volbeat and Illumise.
</li><li> Burmy, based on a bagworm, evolves into a Mothim if male or a Wormadam if female. Their appearances are VERY different, as Mothim is a moth and Wormadam is still a pupa. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Like real bagworms.</a>) Wormadam actually has three appearances, but that's unrelated.
</li><li> Other examples: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">anime</a>, a Latias produced a Latios egg like the Volbeat/Illumise thing. Some species also have sexual trimorphism: Only male Kirlia can evolve into Gallade, but both genders can evolve into Gardevoir. Only female Snorunt can evolve into Froslass, but both can evolve into Glalie. Combee and Salandit can be both genders, but only females evolve into Vespiquen and Salazzle respectively, males do not evolve.
</li><li> Also some species have ACTUAL sexual dimorphism, as in visual differences in the same species based on gender, starting in the fourth generation games. Most of them are tiny differences (such as female Rattata having shorter whiskers) but a few species are very different. Hippopotas/Hippowdon are quite different in color. Male Unfezant have more colorful plumage than the brown-and-gray females, and a trailing red crest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy">Male Frillish are blue, females are pink</a>... and when they evolve the male Jellicent gets a huge Pringles mustache while the female gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">fluffy collar</a>. And then there's Meowstic, which takes it up another notch- the offense-oriented females and support-oriented males not only have different enough fur patterns to be two separate species, they also have different Hidden Abilities and learn different move sets. Another example is Pyroar, where the male sports a huge mane, while the female has a long, flowing mohawk. In some cases it's even applied retroactively to such classics as Pikachu: starting with Gen IV, there's a notch in the end of a female Pikachu's tail.
</li><li> A particularly extreme example occurs with Solgaleo and Lunala. Although technically classified as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">genderless</a> as with most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">legendary Pokémon</a>, the two forms have extreme dimorphism of the same species. The former resembles a giant lion, the latter a giant bat. The Pokédex entries for them also point out that Solgaleo is the male of the species while Lunala is the female.

In contrast, both male and female Inklings can change between squid and humanoid form, and look not too different from each other. That said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one Sunken Scroll implies that their leader DJ Octavio is actually a giant male Octoling</span>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>'s Octo Expansion allows you to play as a male Octoling.
</li><li> Done uniquely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia">Startopia</a></em>. Every single alien race you see has the same model for males and females (notable only in each individual's info, if at all). The Dahanese Sirens (referred to in everything but their intro as just "Sirens") are the only distinctly male and female species, simply looking like humans with wings. However, what we see as humanoid male and humanoid female are, actually, just the reverse according to the employee management screen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> female Deferi have a large purple bony plate on the front of their faces, and eyes with circular pupils. Male Deferi have no plate and vertical slit pupils.
</li><li> Every species in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, except the Humans and the Liir (who are hermaphroditic), have some kind of this or another. The Hivers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Bee People</a> so this is to be expected (not to mention that workers and warriors are sexless to begin with); Zuul females are approximately three times the size of the males and animalistic while the males are weedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psionic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">masterminds</a> with a specialty in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>; Tarka males that become fertile (which only about one in a thousand do, and which can only be accomplished by eating unfertilized Tarka eggs) approximately double in size; and Morrigi females are basically dragons while the males are more akin to birds. This also receives a kind of reverse-lampshading in the fluff, where it's noted that due to the death of sexism in Human society and the <em>lack</em> of dimorphism between men and women, most other races actually have a hard time telling the difference, which can be quite comical. The Hivers are the exception — they can detect airborne estrogen, so they can instantly pick out the females. Unfortunately for female Human spacers, Hiver battle strategy targets the females first.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Naga</a> have this, with monstrous-looking males and humanoid-looking females. Though, to be fair to them, this was not the result of natural evolution, but the result of Queen Azshara's people being corrupted into the Naga by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Old God</a> N'Zoth after the queen made a pact with said Old God. Though the sexual dimorphism of the Night Elves is also...interesting. Although the males are larger and look more muscular, the females are dominant and more aggressive. This is also true of trolls, though to a lesser extent. It was confirmed via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that the hunched appearance of most male trolls is not genetic, but social: they bend over so as not to seem like they are threatening the females.
<ul><li> This game also introduced the eredar whose sexual dimorphism borders on the uncomfortable. Females are tall but slim while males are massive and muscular. It is implied that they have sex by the usual human method however. Not only is it difficult to imagine a female eredar emerging from coitus without injuries, but it has to be assumed eredar genitals are more like those of gorillas than humans. Otherwise...yikes. Needless to say, this makes the eredar or eredar-descended draenei popular among those fans with an S&amp;M bent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarcraft">Worldof Warcraft</a></em> introduces dragons as characters rather than just mounts. Dragons have a herd mating system it seems, with only the Aspect and his or her consorts mating. Something said by Chromie seems to imply that they might also have more than two sexes, or just more than two genders. The Aspect is larger and exhibits many other characteristics that are probably due to their semi-magical nature. Whether the Aspect is male or female varies by which type of dragon, but each type seems to favor one sex over the other. In the Tarecgosa's Rest questline, for example, all the blue dragons vying to be Aspect (to replace the deceased Malygos) are male and it doesn't seem to occur to anyone that a female could be in the running. Presumably though, this would be the opposite among the female-lead red and green dragons.
<ul><li> Also the Zandalari trolls are the exception to rule of extreme sexual dimorphism in trolls. They appear quite androgynous, with males only slightly larger than females: making them actually less dimorphic even than the game's humans. Their gender roles are also more egalitarian than is typical for trolls. Interestingly, the game seems to imply that messing with blood magic is the reason why typical male trolls are so tall and skinny: as the blood trolls exhibit the more normal troll sexual dimorphism. Why it would only change the appearance of male trolls and not female trolls is not directly discussed.
</li></ul></li><li> The Draken in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar">WildStar</a></em> have females who look mostly humanoid, compared to the hunched over and far more bestial males.

In particular, firstborn children are considered to "belong to the goddess" — like actual hyenas, the first pregnancy is almost always fatal to the child. A firstborn who survives is seen as an omen and a lucky charm, a blessed person who was <em>given back</em> by their deity.

<ul><li> In general, in most species where males and females are of disparate sizes, the <em>female</em> is often the bigger one, as she has to produce larger eggs as opposed to the microscopic sperm of the males. The exceptions are when males physically fight over females, with natural selection favoring bigger males: examples include cichlids, horned beetles, and many species of mammals, including humans.
</li><li> Fish:
<ul><li> In some species of anglerfish, after the male attaches himself to the female, his body degenerates until only his testes remain. He ceases to exist as an independent organism, and the female has sperm on tap for the rest of her life. No surprise why the angler fish won the titles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMostExtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMostExtreme">The Most Extreme</a></em> in the episodes "Oddities" and "Appendages".

Not only that, but they have a juvenile stage which is completely distinct from both of them and was itself mistaken for a third species.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/news/lib/195">Pictures of all three fish.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In several fish species, males come in two varieties: conspicuous, muscular macho-males who use aggression to monopolize access to females, and small, inconspicuous ones that resemble females so they can sneak into harems and fertilize eggs without the macho-males noticing them.
</li></ul></li><li> Molluscs:
<ul><li> Female Blanket octopus <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fattistrani.it/post/le-femmine-del-polpo-tremoctopus-violaceus-possono-essere-100-volte-piu-grandi-dei-maschi">Tremoctopus violaceus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can be 100 times bigger than males, and 40.000 heavier. While females may reach 2 m (6.6 feet) in length, the males are 2-2.4 cm.
</li></ul></li><li> Birds:
<ul><li> A great many birds have brightly colored males and plain, often larger females. In fact, the word for a male hawk or falcon is "tiercel", which comes from the French word for "one third", because male raptors are a third smaller than females. This makes a certain evolutionary sense — the female has to carry eggs, so a larger body is needed. Males can get away with being smaller (and thus needing less food) because birds generally don't physically fight except in extreme circumstances — it's too easy to hurt a wing and be crippled. Similarly, males normally are bright and females drab so that a nesting female is hard to spot but a displaying male easy to find. (There is also a theory that some species, like peafowl, are essentially advertising their fitness as a mate by showing off a major handicap — a big tail says "Hey, I can walk around with <em>this</em> strapped to my butt and <em>still</em> avoid predators! I'm an awesome provider!" Zoologists are rather stumped by the peacock - despite what the obvious human assumption would imply about displaying it, actual observance of peahen's mating preferences don't seem to be consistent with anything about the tail - one tail seems, as far as zoologists can tell, as good as another.) The purpose of the size difference in male and female birds of prey is also to discourage competition for food between a mating pair. The larger female can catch large prey (and have plenty to feed her chicks) without worrying about the small male getting in her way.
</li><li> Peafowl are good examples of extreme difference between the sexes, as are most Galliforms (chickens, pheasants, turkeys, etc.).
</li><li> For an inversion of the usual trend, see the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclectus_parrot">Eclectus Parrot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Males are a well-camouflaged green, females are a gaudy red, blue, and purple (Eclectuses are one of the only parrots to practice polygamy, and the females' bright colors make it easier for the male to find his ladies on their respective nests). They were actually classified as two different species until (it is rumored) someone caught them mating.
<ul><li> This was especially unexpected given that unlike most orders of birds, parrot species tend to be so un-dimorphic that it's hard to tell the males and females apart for sure without a blood test or a scope up the cloaca.
</li></ul></li><li> Another odd inversion are the phalaropes. For some reason, this group of little Arctic shorebirds have reversed the usual avian gender roles. Females are brightly colored and fight over males, who are drabber and stay with the nest. They have been described elsewhere as "an entire genus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdressers</a>".
</li><li> Ostriches split the difference: both males and females spend time brooding the eggs, but because females do so in the daytime and males brood at night, the males have black feathers and the females have dusty-brown ones. Thus, each sex camouflages the nest during its babysitting shift.
</li><li> The huia, a strange bird native to New Zealand which was driven extinct by overhunting, had an entirely unique form of sexual dimorphism. The male and female had the same feather markings, but their beaks were shaped very differently. They had separate niches and ate in different ways: claims that they had to work as a team to eat are based on a misunderstanding.
</li></ul></li><li> Snakes:
<ul><li> They are very rarely dimorphic, but some species of constrictors have a similar size discrepancy to birds of prey, for similar reasons.
</li><li> In all python and boa species, both sexes have small claws, known as spurs, on either side of the cloaca. However, they are larger in males.
</li><li> European adders are a rare example, with the males being silver grey with a black zigzag down their backs, while females are light brown with a brown zigzag. Occasionally, both sexes feature a melanistic black variation.
</li></ul></li><li> Males of the common side-blotched lizard are famous for demonstrating three different variations, or "morphs". Each has different color blotches, they vary in size, and they all utilize different mating strategies.
<ul><li> Orange-Throats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">really get around</a>, using their larger size and greater aggression to gather big harems.
</li><li> Blue-throats are monogamous, and prone to having their mates stolen by Oranges. They, however, work cooperatively with fellow Blues, warning each other of intruders and even altruistically fighting off rival Oranges to give their neighbor Blues a chance to mate.
</li><li> Yellow-throats look enough like females that they can sneak into the Orange-throats' harems and reproduce with them on the sly. But they can't pull this trick off with Blue-throats, who have an easier time protecting their single mate and work together with other Blues.
</li><li> You might have noticed this puts them in sort of a rock-paper-scizzors set-up: Oranges steal Blue mates, Yellows cuckold Oranges, and Blues catch Yellows. This means that all three varieties can all live in the same territories, as there's always someone they can outcompete. As all three types are able to reproduce to equal success, the three are at an evolutionary stalemate, with neither strategy being the most "fit" to pass on their genes.
</li></ul></li><li> Southern Sea Lions. The females are small and sleek, much like what most people recognize as a seal. Males, on the other hand, are thrice as big, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/a3etc2/male_southern_sea_lion_south_america/">surprisingly look a lot like actual lions,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with squared-off snouts with large powerful teeth and shaggy manes around their necks not unlike their African feline namesake.
</li><li> Spotted hyenas are a case of Bizarre Sexual Monomorphism: Females are much larger than the males and have identical-looking genitals to males, with a "pseudopenis" and "pseudo-scrotum". They even have to give birth through it, and it tears apart the first time. Most of the time the hyena's first cub dies during birth because of suffocating within this structure. It is theorized that this is a result of increased production of testosterone - creating stronger and more aggressive females who are more capable of fighting and surviving in the literal dog-eat-dog world of the savannah, although why only this species of hyena exhibits this characteristic is still a mystery.
<ul><li> Hyena genitals are so hard to distinguish that quite infamously, one zoo in Japan unsuccessfully tried to breed a pair of hyenas for several years...only to find out later that <em>both hyenas were actually males.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">duck-billed platypus</a> is bizarre enough as it is, but to top it off, male platypuses are actually <em>venomous</em>, delivering an agonizing cocktail of toxins through a horny spur on their hind legs. Female platypuses lack venom glands entirely, and their spurs are smaller and are often shed in infancy.
</li><li> The male musk deer, a tiny antlerless cervid, is distinguished by a pair of <em>SABER TEETH</em>. Yes, a saber-toothed deer. The same can also be said for the Chinese water deer. This identifies both species as being more primitive than their cousins; all cervids had tusks until the development of antlers.
</li><li> Very common among arthropods:
<ul><li> An important distinction between insect sexes is that only female ants, bees, or wasps are in fact capable of stinging: their stingers are modified from ovipositors, an egg-laying organ. Males, being short-lived drones that exist solely to mate with the queen and dies a few days later, have no use for such defenses.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32e8y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32e8y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32e8y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Plus they don't have an analogous structure to modify into a stinger</span>
</li><li> Spiders are infamous for examples of extreme dimorphism between the sexes. There is a tendency of the males to evolve into wanderers, spending their lives looking for more sedentary, web-bound females, resulting in them evolving to very different lifestyle requirements. For instance, in <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Golden_silk.jpg">this picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of a Golden Silk Spider, the two spiders are the same species, with the larger being the female.
<ul><li> Male Salticids (jumping spiders) are often brightly colored and have very large "boxing glove" pedipalps in front, while females are brown or gray with small palps (P. audax, a common lab spider, is an exception to the color rule). Probably because Salticid females are very aggressive hunters, some species' males do elaborate (and hilarious) dances to increase the probability that females will recognize them as a mate rather than a snack.
</li><li> In some species, the male will, after starting the process of sperm transfer (which is typically done with a pair of LEGS, spiders are weird), rotate their abdomen up toward the female's head and try to get her to EAT HIM. This is advantageous for the male, because it will provide her with valuable nutrition when she's finishing up the eggs he's fertilizing and putting them in their egg case. Given the longevity of these male spiders, and the travel time to the next female, he's extremely unlikely to ever encounter a second female anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Scale insects are even more extreme than the spiders in terms of body-dimorphism. As juveniles, males and females look much alike, but when the females mature, they sink their mouths into a plant and become something that looks less like an animal than a wart. Mature males develop wings and fly around looking for females (for a few days, before they die).
</li><li> Even more so than the scale insects, barnacles of the genus <em>Sacculina</em> are... unusual. Males are free-living, wandering animals that don't resemble typical barnacles at all. Females resemble neither barnacles nor the males. As adults, the females parasitize female crabs and look like a generic mass of cancerous tissue rather than a separate animal at all. The adult males also discard their crustacean exoskeleton and implant themselves into the females, becoming basically a packet of sperm. here's a site to read more about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=53">''Sacculina''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>...
</li><li> Fig wasps. Males are tiny compared to females and wingless. They also have short stumpy legs with which they clumsily waddle about inside the fig fruit. Once mated, he cuts open a hole in the fig for the winged female to escape and dies, never seeing the light of day outside the fruit.
</li><li> Bagworm moths. The females are wingless, eyeless, near-legless breeding machines. The male moth mates with the female while she is still in the cocoon, and in some species, particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">asexually-reproducing ones</a>, the young hatch out of the female <em>Alien</em> style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Eusocial</a> insects have sexual <em>tri</em>morphism: the reproducing females look different than the Worker females, which look different from the males.
<ul><li> And some ants have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">sexual TETRAmorphism</a>: reproducing males, reproducing females, workers, and soldiers.
</li></ul></li><li> The adult females of some species of firefly are virtually indistinguishable from the larvae (i.e., grubs), while only the males are the elongated beetles we all know and love.
</li><li> Siafu/Driver Ants. The females are not small for ant standards (being about an inch long). The male is about the size of a large sausage, hence the term "sausage fly" for him. The "sausage" part is a bloated abdomen that makes them look like very obese dragonflies. This abdomen? Contains sperm. When they breed the females release a pheromone that attracts the male, who usually have nothing to do with the females (for good reason!). The females chew off all his limbs and carry him with them until the queen is ready to mate. Then they rip open his belly so the queen can impregnate herself with the contents while the other females eat him.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted by various functional hermaphroditic species, in which "male" and "female" exist in the same individual at once. Played with by a few species that change sex according to age; which "sex" is young and which is old usually depends on which would be more advantaged by large size.
</li><li> Unlike most worms, nematode roundworms have separate males and females, and live parasitically in the gut of humans and other mammals. As is the case of many species, the female is bigger, but the male is distinguished by a distinctively coiled and curly tail! Inverted with the whipworm <em>Trichuris trichiura</em>, where the male is bigger and bulkier. While the thick portion of the female's body is slightly curved and shaped like a banana, the male's coils around 360 degrees and resembles a spiral.
</li><li> The blood fluke <em>Schistosoma</em> is known as the "romantic parasite", because its very different male and female are often obtained in specimens clasped together in a loving wormy embrace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">(ew)</a>. The male is very thick and fat, and has a long narrow groove down his body where the thin and slender female inserts herself into. As the male feeds on the blood of the host, the female gets to share some too, being provided food, shelter, and a ready available mate all in one when she is finally ready to lay her eggs.
</li><li> While male and female mosquitoes look alike, the bizarre sexual dimorphism here is not physical appearance but <em>diet</em>. While the male mosquito is a harmless vegetarian that feeds on flower nectar and plant matter, the female thrives on blood- the vampiric, plague-bearing pest dreaded by all.
</li><li> Primates:
<ul><li> Humans' sexual dimorphism isn't as great as that of our near relatives (men are usually about 5" taller and 45lbs heavier than their sisters). Gorilla and orangutan males are enormous compared to the females, while male and female gibbons sport different colors of fur, plus an inflatable throat pouch for males of some species. It's even more extreme in the larger monkeys, such as baboons, mandrills, or proboscis monkeys.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">Boobs!</a> Er, to elaborate, human females are about the only creatures with naturally permanently swollen breasts, and they don't even need to become pregnant for them to get like that (pregnancy just swells them <em>more</em>). Other mammalian females have rather flat teats until they get pregnant. (Though some human women don't grow much in this area, either. Art also shows that what was average before the Industrial Revolution would be pretty small today.)
<ul><li> One theory is that this is due to the relatively flat faces humans have compared to other primates - our lips don't protrude nearly as much, so without those inflated breasts to suckle on, babies would mash their noses against tougher tissue, making it harder to breathe. The "aquatic ape" theory has things to say about buoyancy during breastfeeding instead. Yet another relates it to the upright walk humans perform — primates generally have a thing for shapely butts and when walking on all fours, these tend to be permanently on display. When humans started walking upright, they looked for a substitute and naturally swollen breasts worked perfectly. But whatever it really is, the actual reason remains a mystery.
</li><li> The word manatee comes from a Caribbean word for breast. The extinct giant manatee is reputed to have had breasts.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, human male penises are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">gigantic</a> compared to other primates (yes, even your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie">Teeny Weenie</a> is massive compared to a gorilla's; "hung like a gorilla" is not a compliment), leading some to believe that before the advent of clothing they, like human breasts now, served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">sexual display</a> in addition to their other functions.
<ul><li> Another thing is that humans don't have a baculum (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum#Absence_in_humans">penis bone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), as one of the only two species of primate (including other apes; they are sporadically present among mammalian species) without. Erection is supported only by blood pressure so, in conjunction with the already over-average size, it means that sexual performance is directly connected to good health (both physical and mental). Which just makes "boner" an ironic name.
</li><li> We and gorillas both have a gestation period of about 8.5-9 months. A healthy human newborn will weigh roughly twice what a healthy newborn gorilla will. A newborn human's brain is also almost as large as what an adult gorilla has and a human baby will be helpless for far longer. Because of this, human reproductive organs (both male and female) have to be larger.
</li></ul></li><li> The recently discovered fossil of an adult male <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> revealed him to have been five to five-and-a-half feet tall. Compared to his female conspecific Lucy, at three-and-a-half feet, this is quite a substantial size difference between sexes, even if it's assumed he was tall and Lucy was short for their species.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hgh3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4hgh3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hgh3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As very few fossils of <em>Australopithecus</em> have been discovered, it's impossible to know whether these examples are typical, or if they were on the extreme high and and low ends of the species' size range.</span>
<ul><li> When their heights are scaled up to match those of modern humans the relative height difference between the two isn't all that different than the height difference between an NBA Center (who are very large men) and a female Olympic Level Artistic Gymnast (who are very small women). If that height difference was normal for them, it would mean that <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> males were three to four times more massive than <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> females.
</li></ul></li><li> Because humans practice body modification — at least to a far greater extent than any other species — this is most commonly used to vastly exaggerate these factors (though it depends a great deal on the relevant culture for, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairIsFeminine">Long Hair Is Feminine</a>). In some cases, this has led to a cultural expectation for this trope to apply when it actually doesn't. For example, in Western culture in the 21st century hair in the armpit is regarded as something men should have and women shouldn't, despite the fact that most women naturally <em>do</em>. Sure, men are usually hairier, but a woman who's healthy and fertile is unlikely to have <em>none</em>.
<ul><li> Some of these body modifications can also result in some forms of artificial sexual dimorphism, based largely on those same cultural expectations. In a few examples, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayan_people_(Myanmar)">Kayan people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Burma have women who wear stacked brass coils that appear to greatly elongate their necks (it is also said that these also provide protection against the bites of tigers (and, we assume, Vampires)). In China, the notorious practice of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding">foot binding<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> meant that a good proportion of Chinese women had feet shaped differently than the males. This can even include things such as earrings and tattoos. Traditionally, earrings were seen as something only women wore and a woman with tattoos was seen as unseemly. While these may no longer apply in modern Western cultural standards, there are still some exceptions (for example, men don't normally wear earrings in both ears or large earrings like the giant hoop variety, and a woman with a fully tattooed arm is generally seen as unusual or noteworthy).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Elephant seals, whose males are about 3-4 times bigger than the females, and have a proboscis-like snout (hence the name). In addition to this, females are mature enough to breed at an age of 3-4 where as males are of breeding age at 5-6 years, but won't have that giant nose until 8 years old. Because of this, there are two breeding behaviors between the older and younger males (Alpha Breeders and Beta Breeders). Alphas will attract a large harem of females, ranging form 30-100 individuals. Betas generally are not successful in attracting a mate, but they do try, often acting as a guard of an Alpha's harem and chasing other males away in exchange for a chance to mate with a female while the Alpha is busy. When that fails, an Betas still look a lot like females and will use this to get close enough to mount an unsuspecting female.
</li><li> Male lions' manes, cervids' antlers, narwhals' tusks, and many (though not all) male bovids' horns set them apart from females of their species, although in the cervids' (deers') case their antlers drop off.
<ul><li> Narwhals are a particularly odd example, as males's tusks serve as sensors for sensing movement of prey in the water, as well as temperature and as clubs for stunning fish. Female narwhals, however, lack the tusk, but don't seem to be handicapped in hunting in any way. To make things even more unusual, a small percentage of female narwals indeed do grow tusks, and neither males nor the rare tusked females ever use them as weapons against other narwhals (the tusk is far too fragile and sensitive for that) so the reason why the tusk is sexually selected for males is still unclear.
</li><li> The reindeer is the sole deer species in which both sexes have antlers, though the females' are smaller. The males' are shed after the autumn rut, whilst the females retain theirs through the winter - it's thought this helps them compete for food with the larger males during this harsh season. This also means that all Santa's reindeer are females! (Not really implausible, as most of them, except Rudolph, have feminine names anyway...)
</li></ul></li><li> Male rotifers (a type of freshwater zooplankton) are barely a quarter the size of females, and are so single-mindedly dedicated to mating that they don't even have mouths. The males starve to death after only a day or two, whereas the females (which eat algae) last a week or more after hatching. To make it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more extreme</a>, a certain class of rotifers, the Bdelloidea, completely abolished all males. It is an entire class with around 450 described species (it is hard to count because there are no shared genetic pools, so we have to rely on morphological differences), reproducing exclusively through parthenogenesis.
</li><li> Like spiders, some species of octopus have much larger females. An extreme example is the argonaut, where the female is about 5 times larger than the male, and secretes a calcareous egg case that looks like a nautilus shell, using a pair of highly-modified tentacles. Female blanket octopi are about 2 meters long, while males are a few centimeters long. Also, in the case of these octopi, they used to find some <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectocotylus">strange parasitic worm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> inside the females. Turned out it was the males' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticEquipment">Exotic Equipment</a>.
</li><li> Well-known pterosaur <em>Pteranodon</em> is known to have differed so much between sexes that, like the creatures above, caused the males and females to be mistaken for different species initially. The male <em>Pteranodon</em> was much larger (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">an 18-foot-long wingspan</a> was the average and some findings suggesting that even larger wingspans were possible as well) and had an enormous head crest on top of his head. The female was smaller (12-foot-long wingspan) and had a tiny or even non-existent crest.
