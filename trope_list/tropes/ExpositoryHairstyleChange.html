This can also be used to show character development and contrast with the present character, since if the once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">Funny Afro</a> sporting person is now shaved bald, something may have happened to induce the change as part of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a>.
</p><p>The addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">stubble</a> on a male character is often used to show that they've either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">gone badass</a>, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow">gone through a rough patch emotionally</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriouslyScruffy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriouslyScruffy">just had more important things to do than shave</a>. Likewise, the sight of a usually picture-perfect woman with waist-length disheveled hair is often used to conjure the image of insanity or sadness, especially in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">The Ophelia</a>.

</li><li> This is a little harder to spot, but around the same time, Ukraine had her hair long, child!Belarus used to have shoulder-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair">Messy Hair</a> tied with a white headband. As an older nation, her hair is waist-level and noticeably straighter but still kept with a band (a black one in her case).

Almost immediately afterwards, she gets over her long-standing crush on Dr. Tofu (which she knew would always be unrequited, considering his own feelings for her sister, Kasumi) and decides not to grow her hair back. Therefore, it could be argued that, in addition to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">Traumatic Haircut</a>, the new hairdo doubles as an Expository Hairstyle Change that signifies her decision to accept that nothing would come of it and move on.
<ul><li> Also of note is Ranma's pre-story switch from a ponytail (in the flashbacks) to a pigtail. The Dragon Whisker story arc explains the very good reason behind it.

Most other samurai in the series either have the short bangs plus ponytail style suitable for teenagers and apprentices or the tonsured style favored by older men, especially bureaucrats. When we start seeing Jin's backstory flashbacks, it becomes clear that he used to have the apprentice style, but stopped cutting it after he became a ronin. His bangs have gone from above his eyebrows to his jawline, suggesting that the time between the flashbacks and the main series timeline is about 3-6 months.

When he admits that he never saw her as more than a maid, Kyoko vows revenge by entering the show business and gets her hair cut to chin-length and dyed chestnut-brown, showing her true colors as a determined, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">scorned woman</a> that will stop at nothing to get Shou to kneel before her.

It's not uncommon that, by the end of the film, the protagonist's appearance has changed somewhat. This is almost always reflected in their hair, and almost always in the main female. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Miyazaki seems to have a thing for short-haired girls.</a>:

<ul><li> Later on in the manga, Princess Kushana, who originally sported a waist-length blonde braid wrapped around her head, chopped it off after she failed to rescue some of her soldiers  who had been assigned a task at odds with their training<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vhs6');"><sup> </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vhs6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vhs6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (Kushana trained them as elite cavalry specializing in quick attacks, but they were put on point defense; that's the equivalent of forcing Navy SEAL Team Six into a WWI trench)</span> and placed in an indefensible position by her brothers  as a show of solidarity as well as a promise to everyone that she would redouble her efforts to hunt down and kill the Princes of Torumekia.

Muska pulls out a pistol and, to prove he's not bluffing, <em>shoots off Sheeta's pigtails</em>. This could represent her growth as a person, no longer willing to be a passive participant in the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em> has an unusual inversion for a Miyazaki film.

She still has the braid after being transformed into an old woman by the Witch of the Wastes, albeit grey and much shorter. However, at the climax of the film, she sacrifices her braid to revive Calcifer (who she'd just realized is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Howl's heart</span>), so even after breaking the curse Sophie's hair remains silver and short.
<ul><li> This is one of the many differences from the original novel. In the book, Sophie's hair was strawberry blonde (i.e. a very light red), and her hair went back to its former colour and style after her curse broke.
</li><li> Howl himself has one in the movie. After Sophie accidentally rearranged his several dozen hair products, his blond hair turned orange, then later black (the latter being his natural colour). His decision to not re-dye it indicates his increasing willingness to drop his façade, as well as his growing trust of (and love for) Sophie.

<ul><li> Jack Bauer's huge hair and beard growth during the time between season 1 and 2 and 5 and 6. Both eventually led to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a>.
<ul><li> A more subtle one occurs in the series in between the first two seasons.

<ul><li> When Octavia starts training to be a Grounder warrior, she adds braids to her hair to better fit in with the Grounders. Clarke changes her hair similarly in Season 3 as she's spending more time among the Grounders than her own people (she also dyes her hair red while trying to live anonymously, but that doesn't last long).
</li><li> Kane and Jaha were both clean-shaven on the Ark and kept their hair short and neat. On the Ground, their hair and beards grow out and become shaggier, as they're living more rugged lives without the positions of control they had on the Ark. Jaha goes back to having short hair, and trims his beard down to a soul patch after he becomes an emissary for ALIE.
</li><li> In Season 3, Jasper cuts his hair down to a buzz cut, which coincides with the development of his angst-ridden and hard-drinking persona.

</li><li> When rewatching old episodes, you can easily tell what season you're in according to Skye's hairstyle. In Season 1, it's at shoulder-length and light brunette. In Season 2, she adds the aforementioned bangs and the color becomes a darker brunette. In Season 3, she gets the aforementioned cut to chin-length and the color goes even darker still (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is also when she switches to going by her previously unknown real name of Daisy</span>).

She later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">cuts it all off</a>. <br/><br/>She stopped cutting it around the time she first meets Sam Anders: on her first trip back to Caprica, it looks like her original haircut in need of a trim, and by the time she gets back, it's just long enough to tie back. Her ponytail gradually gets longer but still neat until the timeskip, after which it's long and untidy until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a>. The growth seems to parallel the erosion of her identity as a soldier.

<ul><li> The character of Zack Addy is given a significant makeover, to signify his emotional development. However, the only real change is his curly floppy hair being trimmed down to a neat short-back-and-sides.
</li><li> Also, the hairstyles of Brennan and Hodgins changed throughout the series. Originally Brennan had characteristically frizzy hair and Hodgins sported a curly afro until her hair became more kempt and his was cut short. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a> #100, the original styles come back.
</li><li> Hodgins also reverts to a scruffier hairstyle and longer hair both after Zack leaves the show and during his season 11 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">Don't You Dare Pity Me!</a> period after being paralyzed, but it gets neater when he starts coping better.

</li><li> He also grows his silly mustache into a full goatee during a time skip. It shows that time has passed and also makes him look more ominous as he makes the transition from pathetic science teacher to dangerous meth cook.
</li><li> Used again during the Season 5 premiere, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we see a flash-forward to Walt sometime in the future with a full head of hair and a shaggy unkempt beard.

It's almost as if he too is aware of this; when in episode 2 of season 7, he attempts to <em>pretend</em> he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> still soulless</span>, he slicked-down his hair, whereas the rest of the season (where he lets his softer side come out) it's pretty consistently tousled.
</li><li> Willow starts off the series sporting chest-length hair, which she sports for the first two seasons. During Seasons 3-5, her hair gets gradually shorter and less straight as she grows more and more away from her original shy nerd girl persona and then gets longer and more straight again in Seasons 6-7 as she becomes more independent and comes into her true power as a witch. Dark Willow's hair becomes very dark, almost black, and changes back to her natural red when Xander brings her back from being evil. Conversely, Goddess Willow's hair is pure white.
</li><li> Buffy's hairstyle changes in episodes where she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHerself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHerself">Not Herself</a>, e.g. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E9SomethingBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E9SomethingBlue">Something Blue</a>" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a>), "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E16WhoAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E16WhoAreYou">Who Are You</a>" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>), and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E17Superstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E17Superstar">Superstar</a>" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>). In fact, whenever Buffy's hair is curly, it's normally a sign that she's not acting herself or crazy. This goes all the way back to Xander's daydream in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E4TeachersPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E4TeachersPet">Teacher's Pet</a>".
<ul><li> In Season 6, Buffy's hair has darkened to a more strawberry blonde to reflect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her trauma at being ripped out of heaven</span>. As her toxic relationship with Spike progresses, it's marked by a drastically shorter cut at the season's midpoint. She gets over it at the end of the season, and the start of the next shows her hair having grown out again.
</li></ul></li><li> As a human and Angelus, Angel often sported either long, shoulder-length hair, either down or in a loose ponytail. After regaining his soul, he cut his hair shorter by the 1920s, occasionally slicked with a side part. In the next five decades, he kept his hair that way until the 1970s where had grew out his hair again. Since the late 1990s during his tenure in Sunnydale, his hair was consistently spiked upward at the front with styling product (a fact that he was apparently unaware of, due to his reaction upon seeing his reflection in a mirror during a trip to Pylea). The length seemed to be slighter shorter around 2002 and while CEO of Wolfram &amp; Hart, he sometimes had his hair combed over. Around the fall of Los Angeles, Angel returned to his notable spiked look.
</li><li> Gunn was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy">Bald, Black Leader Guy</a>. He grew a short layer of hair once he got his lawyer smarts. It was not mentioned by a character until more than halfway through the season (shortly after which, ironically, Gunn returned to his original cut after the cost of keeping his new knowledge resulted in him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unwittingly taking part in a conspiracy that led to the death of his ex-lover, Fred</span>).
</li><li> Also, when Wesley goes through his darker phases, he grows a layer of stubble. Seasons 1 and 2 Wes have no facial hair at all, while seasons 3-5 have Wes with varying degrees of facial hair.
</li><li> In high school, Cordelia kept long, medium brown hair and had a notable fringe in the eleventh grade. In Los Angeles, Cordelia continued with the same hair length, though it appeared darker. She eventually cut her hair down to shoulder length. She then cut her hair further down into a graduated bob cut with blonde highlights after being fired. Months later, she then had short, brown chin-length hair but then changed to a blonde, layered bob cut up around the time of her ascension as higher being, but then changed brown again and short length when she was possessed. After her coma, she had a shoulder length, brown perm. As a spirit, her hair returned to its early stages as long, straight and brown.
</li><li> For most of history, Anya's hair remained dark brown and long in length. While at Sunnydale High, she retained short, light brown hair while made it darker when she started dating Xander. By the end of 1999, she lightened her hair cut it down into a bob but let it grow out the following months. During the months Glory was around, she retained short, curly and blondish hair which eventually grew out the later months. After Buffy's resurrection, she kept long, sandy blond hair, similar to Buffy's the year before. In the months as a vengeance demons after Willow's attempt at destroying the world, she had long, dark brown hair and eventually cut it down and made it blond again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before her death</span>.
</li><li> Oz's hair color continuously changed: before meeting Willow, he had light red hair; he dyed it chestnut brown after his first meeting with Willow, who noticed the change; he dyed his hair blond after his first monthly transformations; during the first months of his repeated senior year, he had dark hair with light spikes, which teenage Principal Snyder thought was "great hair"; he dyed his hair black around the time he began dating Willow again; he dyed his hair blond shortly before graduation; at graduation he had dark hair with light spikes again; during college at UC Sunnydale and in Tibet, he had auburn hair.
</li><li> Lindsey McDonald had longer hair in the first two seasons. Midway through Season 2 when he starts feeling conflicted between his growing attraction to Darla and Wolfram &amp; Hart's plans - leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> - his hair is cut short. When he returns in Season 5 as a villain once again, his hair is back to its long length.
</li><li> During her coma, Faith's hair grew longer and became noticeably wavy and lighter.

As the seasons progress and she becomes a more obvious love interest for Richard Castle, her hair becomes more stereotypically feminine, by growing longer, wavier, and getting blonde highlights. In one case, <a class="urllink" href="http://badwasabi.tumblr.com/post/32365606333/and-so-after-a-while-spent-brooding-in-the-rain">apparently overnight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> Phoebe went through five hair changes in the fourth season. She started off with blonde highlights that disappeared into a caramel brown as Paige was welcomed into the fold. It was dyed brown for one episode and then darker still when Cole proposed. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is possessed by the Source</span> she has cut it to shoulder length. Then when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she becomes his queen</span> it darkens to an almost black hue. Notably in Season 5 when she's trying to distance herself from Cole her hair is longer. Her drastic short haircut in Season 6 was a case of Alyssa Milano wanting to do something for her 30th birthday, but it does overlap with Phoebe gaining empathic powers. Her hair growing longer in season 8 coincides with her desire to find love as opposed to just having a baby. Before that she first dyed her hair blonde in Season 3 which coincided with her romance with Cole. The colour softened and darkened the more the romance developed. When she starts having visions of her future self in Season 7, she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a>.
</li><li> Paige's hair turned red in Season 5 when she jumped into her duties as a witch. The other characters joked that her hair turned that color after a potion blew up on her. She goes strawberry blonde in Season 6 when she starts working temp jobs and she has gone back to her natural brown when she stops going to the jobs.
</li><li> Prue's hair starts off in a bob at the start of the series but grows longer as her powers grow. It's noticeably nearly waist-length in Season 3 when she's at her most powerful.
</li><li> Piper is notable in that her hair doesn't change much in the series. Her hair grows to waist length in the third season and stays that way for the whole series. She does start off in the series having bangs which she gets rid of early on in Season 2; they return for a bit in Season 6, coinciding with the drama between her and Leo.
</li><li> In the episode "Morality Bites" the sisters visit the future and all have different hairstyles. Prue's normally black hair has turned blonde, to show that she's a powerful businesswoman now. Phoebe's shoulder-length hair has grown to waist-length along with her powers increasing. Piper's hair is curly, reflecting that she's a mother now. Amusingly this becomes prophetic of the other actresses changing their hair a lot on the show (the episode is in Season 2) while Piper's wouldn't change much.
</li><li> Phoebe, Prue and Paige reverting to their teenage selves in different unrelated episodes is accompanied by them getting thick bangs.

<ul><li> The First Doctor companion Steven Taylor shaves off his beard (offscreen) after the Doctor agrees to take him on as a companion, signifying his decision to join the crew, not to mention his decision to rejoin civilisation as he'd been marooned on a planet populated entirely by spherical robots for two years.
</li><li> Both Liz and the Doctor sport different haircuts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E3TheAmbassadorsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E3TheAmbassadorsOfDeath">"The Ambassadors of Death"</a> to the ones they had in the previous story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E2DoctorWhoAndTheSilurians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E2DoctorWhoAndTheSilurians">"Doctor Who and the Silurians"</a>. From this and a few other details (like the Doctor now having a fully-decorated and quite worn-looking living room), we can surmise that a reasonably long time has elapsed between the end of "Doctor Who and the Silurians" and "The Ambassadors of Death", somewhat helping to explain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst">Angst? What Angst?</a> after such a harrowing adventure and that the Doctor seems to have mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">forgiven</a> the Brigadier for committing a genocide of defenseless thinking beings at the end of the last story.
</li><li> The Third Doctor's hair gets longer and increasingly elaborate and curled as his relationship with UNIT softens up.
</li><li> Mike Yates is kicked out of UNIT at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E2InvasionOfTheDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E2InvasionOfTheDinosaurs">"Invasion of the Dinosaurs"</a>. By the time of his reappearance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders">"Planet of the Spiders"</a>, his hair has grown out into a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionDissonance">then</a>) fashionable long cut rather than the military haircut he'd sported up until that point.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E6TheInvasionOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E6TheInvasionOfTime">"The Invasion of Time"</a>, the Fourth Doctor wears his hair differently  with a side parting, and straightened at the root  to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch">darker, crazier look</a>.
</li><li> Leela was intended to start wearing her straight hair in Victorian-esque curls to mimic the Doctor's curly hair and indicate his growing influence on her, but due to the season being re-edited to make K-9 a companion she reverts to her old hairdo after that story.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor goes through a few subtly different shapes and cuts for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair">mop</a> as he goes, reflecting the show feel. In S12, when he's still going for the scruffy "eternal student" aesthetic, it looks like a short cut that has been grown out due to neglect (the actor had just grown out a short cut he'd had for a previous role); in the darker Seasons 13-15, it becomes deliberately layered long cut with long sideburns, giving him a Byronic look; in the goofy S17, he has it in a rounder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">Funny Afro</a> cut with short, precisely-groomed wedge-shaped sideburns. It looks most different in Season 18, where it is visibly greying and has a different texture to match the Doctor's more subdued and dark personality. This was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInInfirmity">Written-In Infirmity</a> as the actor was seriously ill and it had made his usually glossy and curly hair dull and straight (he'd had to have it permed before resuming filming). In the same season, after Romana leaves the TARDIS, he alters his short fringe into a sort of bouffant style with the fringe combed off his face.
</li><li> Generally speaking, any Doctor who returns after a significant timeskip will do so with a different haircut. Specific examples include the long-haired Seventh Doctor in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTVMTheTVMovie">TV Movie</a>, the short-haired Eighth Doctor and long-haired War Doctor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thPrequelTheNightOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thPrequelTheNightOfTheDoctor">"The Night of the Doctor"</a> and the short-haired Curator in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>.
</li><li> While all of the Doctors have different hair each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">regeneration</a>, all of the Classic Doctors seem to prefer relatively long hair, generally hovering somewhere between earlobe and shoulder, with the Eighth Doctor, the most recent at the time, getting Byronic flowing hair. Therefore, when the series got a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a> after a hiatus of over a decade, media commentators at the time were genuinely shocked that the costume department had decided to give the new, Ninth Doctor a buzz cut. This was to distinguish the new series from the old one, as well as a way of indicating that the Ninth Doctor was going to be the most moody, no-nonsense Doctor yet seen  definitely no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">scarves or frilly shirts in sight</a>! (It should also be noted that the shaved-head-and-leather-jacket look was thoroughly associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LGBTFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LGBTFanbase">gay communities in the UK at the time</a>, which served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> to the producer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">last work</a> and also fit the new interpretation of the character.) All of the modern Doctors so far have also had rather short hair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thPrequelTheNightOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thPrequelTheNightOfTheDoctor">"The Night of the Doctor"</a> shows that the old Eighth Doctor has cut off his iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairedPrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairedPrettyBoy">pretty-boy long hair</a>, indicating that he is now much older and much less of a pretty boy, and has been living as a soldier for some time. He also has started wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">Perma-Stubble</a>, despite having been clean-shaven in his typical appearance.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>, we meet the incarnation between the Doctor's Eighth and Ninth, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeGuerre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeGuerre">does not go by the name "The Doctor" due to a desire to disown his actions in war</a>. One of the main indications that he's not like his other selves is that he is the only one who wears facial hair, when every other Doctor, regardless of age and taste otherwise, seems to prefer being clean-shaven (a few habitually wear small, tidy sideburns, and the Second and Tenth Doctors have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">perma-shadow</a>, but that's it  this preference is briefly lampshaded by the Tenth Doctor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CiNSTimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CiNSTimeCrash">"Time Crash"</a>). This is further emphasized by the fact that the newly-regenerated War Doctor, as he has not yet participated in the War, is clean-shaven as he checks out his reflection and goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">pick up a gun</a>.
<ul><li> The Tenth Doctor spent this episode with a much longer, shaggier haircut than usual, which Eleven calls his "grunge phase". Since the episode is presumably set between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">"The Waters of Mars"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">"The End of Time"</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">his part of the timeline</a>, it may reflect his despair at nearly crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, as well as his impending death. Returning to the closer cut would in turn reflect at least some acceptance of what's coming, even if he still takes it rather badly when it's time to regenerate.
</li></ul></li><li> Clara's hairstyles during Season 8 are used to indicate the length of time passing between each trip, due in part to one of her gimmicks as a companion being that she doesn't actually live with the Doctor. It fluctuates wildly in terms of length  super-long in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E3RobotOfSherwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E3RobotOfSherwood">"Robot of Sherwood"</a>, bobbed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E8MummyOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E8MummyOnTheOrientExpress">"Mummy on the Orient Express"</a>, longish with a blunt fringe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E6TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E6TheCaretaker">"The Caretaker"</a>, etcetera. The Doctor's haircuts differ more subtly but are similarly inconsistent  longer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E5TimeHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E5TimeHeist">"Time Heist"</a>, shorter in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">"Deep Breath"</a>, very short at the sides with a longer bit on top in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline">"Flatline"</a>...
</li><li> Also averted a couple of times due to problems. For instance, the Chief Scientist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames">"The War Games"</a> grows a beard between several episodes that are only a few hours apart diegetically, which can be a pretty confusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePassageBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePassageBeard">Time-Passage Beard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> seeing as the plot involves villainous use of time machines. Similarly, the Doctor's hair has been cut noticeably between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E1TheDominators">"The Dominators"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber">"The Mind Robber"</a> even though the two stories lead straight into each other, and everyone's (the Brigadier's, Sarah Jane's and the Fourth Doctor's) hair has grown out significantly between the cliffhanger at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders">"Planet of the Spiders"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot">"Robot"</a> even though they link directly to each other, bad enough that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackWithTheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackWithTheOtherDarrin">cliffhanger had to be reshot to make it less noticeable</a> (although justified in the case of the Doctor, who is still regenerating).
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor's hair changes throughout his era rival those of his Third incarnation's. The difference between the very, very short close-cut in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">"Deep Breath"</a> to the wild, flowing hair in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime">the 2017 Christmas Special</a> is staggering, and it reflects the Doctor's change from a grumpy, stern old man to his much more lax, goofy and younger-acting personality he developed later on in his era. It's a change you don't really notice if you watch episode-by-episode as it's very gradual.
</li></ul></li><li> Aeryn Sun generally wore her hair somewhat past her shoulders on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, and usually tied up in a neat little braid, which only made sense as she was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>. She softens slightly as the show progresses, and when John first encounters her at the beginning of the fourth season she has a possibly terminal condition  and a <em>sheet</em> of <em>very</em> long, thick, and unbound black hair (which somehow manages to fit in a coldsuit like Scorpius'). Her hair returned to something approximating its original length some time after she got better, but she rarely (if ever) has her hair braided or even in a ponytail from that point on  because even in her most badass moments, she's generally being badass because someone she cares about is in trouble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita">La Femme Nikita</a></em>, the three top people in Section One, Operations, Madeline, and Michael, all get dramatic new haircuts at the beginning of season 3, signaling that Section has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken a level in badass</a>. Partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> because the actor playing Madeline had lost her hair due to chemotherapy and the actor playing Michael couldn't stand the long mane anymore and just got his hair cut between seasons. The actor playing Operations went from gray to platinum, presumably in solidarity with Section's sleek new look. Nikita kept her long blonde tresses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> had a flashback with a mustache-wearing Wash that disturbed more than one viewer. And, it's implied, his future wife.

When she pretends to be Littlefinger's niece, she dyes her hair black until she has to be identified as one of the Starks.
</li><li> Jaime grows an appropriately leonine one while in Northern captivity in Season 2 and he keeps it thick into the rest of Season 3. His hairstyle changes to a shorter, simpler cut in Season 4 to indicate his new-found humility and a disconnect with his earlier self.

After his rescue, we cut to a scene where John is being criticised for his incredibly unflattering moustache by Mrs Hudson, who tells him that he can't escape middle age. We then cut straight back to Sherlock lying in an impromptu barber's chair in Mycroft's office, being shaved with a straight razor and having his hair restored to the same style he wore in previous seasons while telling Mycroft that he has no interest in reaching middle age himself. This is all obviously done to highlight the differences in their attitude - John is trying to move on, even if it doesn't suit him, while Sherlock cannot move on and sees no reason why anyone might want to.
</li><li> Later that episode, despite ignoring large amounts of criticism of his moustache, John eventually shaves it off because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scanned</a> his fiancée Mary and determined that she secretly hates it. John attempts to explain to her later that he shaved it for her benefit, but both Mary and the audience know it's because Sherlock was the one who suggested he do so.
</li><li> When Sherlock has been living for months in a squat doing heroin, he grows a rubbish beard and wears his curly hair in a neglected mop. Even though he cleans himself up afterwards and gets his life back on track, as indicated by him reverting to his usual clean-shaven look, he only starts wearing his hair in the tidy, flowing style he used to at the point when the audience knows for sure that he'd only been doing it as part of a cover, and not because he's succumbed to his junkie impulses again.

Teal'c, usually shaven bald, grows hair in later seasons as he becomes more like Earth humans.

</li><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Hockey</a></em>, Tony's hairstyle has changed from a huge patch of brown hair near his forehead to more laid back black hair, giving him more of a gangster attitude.
</li><li> A number of characters in the mobile game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> are shown with different hairstyles in the previous school year, some changes being more significant to characterization than others. The main two:
<ul><li> Rei loses the slicked-back look he had as a delinquent, instead opting for a more relaxed look that better suits his current "tired old man" persona.
</li><li> Tsumugi grows out his hair and puts an electric blue streak in it, apparently as part of some kind of agreement with Natsume. He states a couple of times that he finds it annoying and wants to cut it, but Natsume won't let him. It's possibly part of an attempt to make up with Natsume following the things he did the previous year.
</li></ul></li><li> In the last scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, Garnet's hair, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which she had cut to chin length midway through the game, has grown back down to its original waist-length,</span> indicating the amount of time that has passed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>: Sometime after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Fort Zeakden</a>, Ramza lost the ponytail marking him as a cadet, also symbolic of how, at the same time, he opened his eyes to what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> Ivalice is if you're not at the top of the heap. (His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">cowlick</a> remained, though, because he refused to be anything but a determined optimist and hero.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> and related:
<ul><li> In <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> flashbacks, Vincent Valentine is shown as a Turk — with short, more military-esque hair. After sleeping for a few decades, (during which the rest of his body isn't aged in the least), he's now a gun-wielding, shape-shifting good guy — with long hair to the middle of his back.
</li><li> Midway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>, Zack changes his hairstyle after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having to kill his mentor.</span>
</li><li> The only time in the original game or <em>Compilation</em> when Cloud is shown without his trademark spiky hairstyle is at the end of <em>Crisis Core</em>, at the moment when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">snaps and loses his identity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Yuna, the demure and timid Summoner from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, wore her hair down to her shoulders during her pilgrimage. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, set after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the defeat of Sin</span>, she has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">gun-wielding</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Sphere Hunter</a>, and her hair is cropped much shorter except for a long, rope-like braid that falls down to ankle-height.
<ul><li> It's also styled to look exactly like Tidus's hairstyle (long braid aside). A cute (and completely understandable) homage to her gone-forever boyfriend, but potentially embarrassing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after he gets better.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The poster boy (representative of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>) in various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> trailers has his gear change based on a different battle class, which happens with every new expansion announced. By <em>Stormblood</em>, the character's hair goes from short to a mop head look mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a>, signifying their wearied and more experienced look. By <em>Shadowbringers</em>, the character has grown a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">Perma-Stubble</a>. Because the poster boy (and by extension, the player) has gone through several emotionally traumatizing events throughout the story, the longer hair and stubble reflects their changing attitude.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> does this with a few characters to show changes after the timeskip.
<ul><li> Dimitri's hair grows longer and becomes a mess, reflecting his broken mental state and how he spent the last five years as a vagrant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> on every route except Crimson Flower.</span>
</li><li> Ferdinand's hair grows halfway down his back and becomes tangled and unkempt in the back. This is because he's too preoccupied with the war to remember to cut it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and if recruited on any route besides Crimson Flower, because he spends the next five years as a fugitive.</span>
</li><li> Bernadetta's hair is much neater, better showcasing her more confident personality, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> always being out of her room on Crimson Flower.</span>
</li><li> While Sylvain's hair is still spiky, it's also neater than it was pre-timeskip, reflecting his more serious personality during the war phase.
</li><li> Ingrid cuts her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyishShortHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyishShortHair">barely chin-length</a>. This shows that she's fully dedicated to fighting, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and on any route besides Azure Moon, cutting her ties to House Galatea to fight for her own beliefs.</span>
</li><li> Annette loses her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">Girlish Pigtails</a> and Ashe's hair is both neater and slightly longer, showing that they are now full-grown.
</li><li> Marianne cuts her bangs and her updo is noticeably neater, signifying her better mental health.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the facial-hair variety in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarPS4">God of War (PS4)</a></em>: Kratos has grown a full, thick beard in contrast to his clean-shaven younger self to demonstrate just how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> he has become.
</li><li> In the <em>Second Vision</em> titles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster">The Idolmaster</a></em>, a few of the idols change up their hairstyles. Ritsuko switches her girly braids for a professional bun, Azusa cuts her hair short (which she also does in the anime when Ryugu Komachi is formed), and Mami grows out her side ponytail to distance herself from her identical twin Ami.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em>, you know Jak is going to be all badass now when you see that he's grown a soul patch. Likewise, you can tell he's matured and mellowed out a bit (a <em>bit</em>) at the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander">Jak 3: Wastelander</a></em> when he trades it in for a goatee.
</li><li> When Riku reappears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> his hair is grown down past his shoulders, reflecting both his increased maturity struggle he's been having. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em>, he's resolved most of his issues and has cut it shorter than it was at the start of the series, implying an off-screen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>, Illium initially sports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs">Blinding Bangs</a> to illustrate his crippling shyness and lack of confidence. After being empowered by the Elder Crystal, his hair is bleached white and shaved to a crew cut, revealing his striking red eyes and burning resolve to defend the Verdant Flora.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: Jack's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> over the six-month <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, moving from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a>, is marked by her growing her hair out from "recently shaved" to "a ponytail". She's pretty much the only teammate who changes hairstyle; everyone else either uses the exact same model, or has the exact same model minus the Cerberus insignia.
<ul><li> Ashley has literally let her hair down following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, Solid Snake has grown out the cropped hair he wore in all of his appearances before that. He's also unshaven, when he had appeared clean-shaven in every game up until then. This serves to signify that he's no longer working with any organisation that particularly cares how long he wears his hair or if he bothers to shave, as well as to indicate the much more mellow and easy-going personality he developed as a result of the events of the previous game (the game document suggests the change indicates a man who now has higher priorities than his personal appearance).
</li><li> Also in <em>MGS2</em>, Olga has a military buzz cut in the Tanker chapter and a short bob in the Plant chapter. This serves as an early indication that her loyalties do not lie with her unit anymore. Specifically, the unit is no longer her 'only family' as she announced in the Tanker chapter - in between her appearances, she's become a mother.
</li><li> Big Boss's hair deserves some attention: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, Snake goes from styling his long hair in a side part to having it scraped off his face with a bandanna, making it resemble the hairstyle of his mentor The Boss (who switches her own hair to a ponytail). She even points it out after she meets up with him later, apparently finding it immature. At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>, Snake discards the bandanna along with The Boss's ideals, and it's gone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>, he switches to an imitation of her ponytail style.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em>, Raiden starts out with his <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> hairstyle of long blond hair, which in his white armour body gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine">pure and noble, knightly sort of look</a>. When he gets a black and red armour body, his hair has been coloured cold white, making him look much more inhuman and demonic.
</li><li> When Sunny was first introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, she had boyishly short hair like her mother. When we see her again a few years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em>, Sunny has let her hair grow a little and decorated it with a hair clip adorned with a blue flower. In that time, she has grown happy and content after coming out of her shell.
</li><li> Otacon's hairstyle stays a similar length and style in all of his appearances (the position of the parting moves about, but that's all), but the colour changes from grey, to light brown, to dark brown as he becomes more confident and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier">sexier</a>.
</li><li> Come Paz's reappearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes</a></em>, her head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairOfGoldHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairOfGoldHeartOfGold">wavy blond hair</a> has been buzzed off as just a tiny indicator of the unspeakable, hideous torture she's been subjected to.
</li><li> A lot of fans were delighted to see Psycho Mantis, whose head was shaved in his previous appearances, appear with a mop of shoulder-length red hair in his appearance as a child in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em>.

</li><li> The Prince in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaWarriorWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaWarriorWithin">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</a></em> grows a layer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">Perma-Stubble</a> in combination with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> person gets much more grizzled, to the point that some wanted him to use the sword to shave the stuff off.
</li><li> Siegfried Schtauffen of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Series</a></em> originally had short hair, but with Soulcalibur and onward, he grows it past shoulder length before cutting it and slicking it back in Soulcalibur V.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2">Tales of Xillia 2</a></em>, Elise sports a shorter haircut with twin tails which reflects the fact that she's overcome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">her former nature</a> and become more outgoing.
</li><li> Used constantly throughout the <em>Persona</em> universe to represent a character's growth:
<ul><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Persona</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Maki Sonomura</a>, who wore her hair shoulder-length while a shy and conflicted teen, comes to the sequel as a determined woman with short-cropped, boyish hair, set on making amends for her role in the previous game.
</li><li> Eriko Kirishima, excitable fan of the occult, traded her waist-length ponytail for a short bowl-cut style in time for <em>Persona 2</em>. And, if you played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">original North American release</a> of <em>Revelations: Persona</em>, her hair also changed from blonde (originally dark brown) to solid black.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">Yukino Mayuzumi</a> styled herself as a <em>sukeban</em>, with extremely short and messily-cropped dyed hair and an ankle-length skirt, a holdover from her days as a delinquent boss. By the time of <em>Persona 2</em>, she's a professional photojournalist, and she's still just as much of a badass (if not more) but has grown her hair out to shoulder-length (revealing it to be very curly) and holds it down with a floppy gray hat.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">Reiji Kido</a>, the fearsome and antisocial misfit, let go of the enormous, unruly mane of his teen years for a more respectable (if still slightly messy) short style befitting his ordinary job as a salesman. His new look also hides the X-shaped scar on his forehead, which he used to display proudly as part of his badass image.
</li></ul></li><li> Within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Maya Amano, while still in junior-high, wore heir hair in a messy pageboy cut during those fateful days of the Masquerade. As an adult, she wears it long, slightly past her shoulders, and perfectly coiffed.
</li><li> Eikichi Mishina's entire look was as ordinary as anyone could get as a kid, but when he fell in love with Miyabi, he decided someone as pretty as she was would never even notice someone as plain as he, so he developed a glam-rocker style which included spiky, dyed hair with a shocking white stripe down the middle.
</li></ul></li><li> Within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou">Mitsuru Kirijo</a> is shown in <em>The Answer</em> to have worn her hair in twin ponytails, "princess curl"-style, as a child, when she first Awakened to her Persona. By ninth grade, well on her way to establish SEES, she still had the curls but wore her hair loose save for a headband. By the time of <em>Persona 3</em> proper, her hair is waist-length and wavy, with only a slight curl in the ends.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>:

Two years later, in <em>Persona 4</em>, her long, straight hair reaches down the middle of her back, more fitting for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a> image.

Over half of these changes receive lovingly detailed depictions in the show.
<ul><li> Also a topknot for being Fire Lord. Since, y'know, you can't wear the crown without one. He continues to wear it down in private, however, so this isn't a <em>change</em> like all the others.
</li><li> The show put on by the Ember Island Players about the Gaang's adventures parodies Zuko's hairstyles by changing his actor's hair several times during the play, some of which are outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Everything is stretched in their production, however</a>.

<ul><li> Her future counterpart sported a pixie cut in the original series episode "Ben 10,000" and later a ponytail in "Ken 10".
</li><li> Julie sported chin-length hair in <em>Alien Force</em> and <em>Ultimate Alien</em>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">Girlish Pigtails</a> in <em>Omniverse</em>.

When we see him again in the present, his bangs are now sticking straight up, a style that remains for the rest of the series.
</li><li> At the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> episode "XANA Awakens" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, Odd has a very different hairstyle; he adopts his current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">spiky hair</a> to mimic his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalAvatar">Digital Avatar</a> on Lyoko. (He actually has to go through the change twice because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Return to the Past</a>.)
</li><li> Technus of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> starts off with wild hair that would make Doc Brown proud; when he upgrades himself to Technus 2.0, his hair is now sleek and tied back to possibly allude to the removal of his flaws from his first form since he now dons a more serious outlook.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, Amy Wong apparently grew her hair out between "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E18TheDevilsHandsAreIdlePlaythings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E18TheDevilsHandsAreIdlePlaythings">The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaM1BendersBigScore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaM1BendersBigScore">Bender's Big Score</a>".

<ul><li> Three years after the events of book three, Mako and Bolin — especially Mako — both have hairstyles that are more restrained and kempt than what they've worn previously, as befits their roles as a bodyguard to royalty and a peacekeeping soldier. When Mako goes back to his old job as a cop in the sequel comic, he reverts to the more casual look.
</li><li> Jinora's signature hairdo has become a bob after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> having to shave it off at the end of book 3 to receive her Airbending Master tattoos</span>. All of Tenzin and Pema's children have grown their hair out to some degree, in fact.

He even takes a moment to tie it into a ponytail and luxuriously shake it <em>before</em> laying the smackdown on the bad guys. This is never explained or referred to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> Glimmer grows her hair out into a bob between the third and fourth seasons, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making it look more like her dead mother's hair</span>, but unlike its in-universe inspiration, it's much more asymmetrical, as if to show that she hasn't fully stepped into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Angella's</span> shoes and is still working on fitting into her newfound role. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And indeed, she proves very insecure about her authority as queen, and makes quite a few mistakes, at least one of them catastrophic.</span>
</li><li> Catra gets her hair more under control, and removes her ear-tufts, as she moves to her fourth season costume and tries to get herself under control - she's working to suppress her more emotional, erratic side and concentrate on getting what she thinks she wants. In particular, she removes the tufts after Shadow Weaver touches them while manipulating her, in an obvious attempt to shore up her emotional vulnerabilities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It doesn't work, and her second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>, which takes place after she's gotten her hair more controlled, is if anything <em>even more</em> emotionally devastating than the first.</span>

<ul><li> In Season 3, Ezra Bridger sports a buzzcut, as opposed to the mop-top he had previously, to reflect his more serious, darker outlook after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Malachor</a>.
</li><li> In Season 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kallus</span> wears his hair loose and uncombed as an Alliance officer, unlike how he wore it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">as an Imperial</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Back when Greg and Rose first met, Amethyst had short, chin-length hair, which was reflective of her childish personality at the time. Later she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">changed</a> it to be around ankle-length to show her personality's development into that of a slightly more mature teenager.

</li><li> Connie sported waist-length <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair">Rapunzel Hair</a> throughout the series' first four seasons and the start of season five. However, during the time of the latter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and Steven argue over him surrendering himself to Homeworld</span>, leading to a weeks-long estrangement between them. By the time Steven (and the audience) see her again at Kevin's party, she is revealed to have cut or had someone cut her hair down to chin-length and added bangs. Following the two-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between the end of the fifth season and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">Steven Universe: The Movie</a></em>, her hair has regrown to shoulder-length, and she retains her bangs, while also keeping part of it tied back with hair clips. She keeps this style throughout the epilogue <em>Future</em> season.
</li><li> Sadie sported blonde, shoulder-length hair that remained relatively unchanged throughout the first four seasons and most of season five of the original series. However, after joining the band that would become Sadie Killer and the Suspects and quitting her job at the Big Donut, she dyes her hair green right before the end of the series (possibly just for one concert). At some point during the two-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between season five and the movie, she has just the tips and edges of her hair dyed (in a lighter shade of green). By the time of Little Homeschool's first graduation ceremony in the <em>Future</em> epilogue series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by which point the band has broken up and she has started dating Shep</span>, she has returned her hair to its natural blonde color and now wears it in a ponytail.
</li><li> Throughout the franchise, Steven's signature curly hair remains relatively unchanged, save for a few temporary exceptions. The most notable changes, however, come during the epilogue <em>Future</em> season:
<ul><li> After Steven trains with Jasper to hone his newly-emerged destructive powers, his hair briefly shapes into a pompadour hairstyle to match his new ruthless (and slightly arrogant) personality.
</li><li> Later, after returning from Homeworld, sinking into deep denial about every bad thing that has happened to him as of late, and trying to help others the way he used to as a kid, his hair shapes to resemble that of his late mother in her Diamond form.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In addition to Pidge's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, Allura stopped appearing with her hair down after becoming a Paladin in season 3 by sporting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimAndProperBun">Prim and Proper Bun</a> for the rest of the series, though would still appear with her hair down during the final season, along with Acxa outgrowing her hair to neck length during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between season 6 and 7 and Honerva undoing her bun by having her hair down after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">becoming Haggar</a> before tying it to a ponytail during the final season, following after regaining her pre-Quintessence identity and then into a bun in the final episodes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, Kimiko tends to sport a different hairstyle in almost every episode when she's outdoors. Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinChronicles">Xiaolin Chronicles</a></em> as her hairstyle remains the same when outdoors.
