Indeed, he may say, "I give my word as a gentleman."
</p><p>More elaborate formulas are possible. This may be because their word is not binding without them, or to emphasize their seriousness. This can be "I swear by X (Usually a deity)" — occasionally with the implication that X will personally avenge you on them if they swear falsely — or a specific curse that they invoke to fall on them if they fail (usually expressed in the form "May X strike me down"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Bolt of Divine Retribution</a> is not unknown as punishment.
</p><p>Conversely, some characters, particularly in settings where honor is held highly, will consider any kind of statement, no matter how casual, as binding.
</p><p>Making a blank-check promise — "Yes, I will do something for you" — or making it only because you have been lied to may lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, where a character insists on carrying it out anyway.

He gives a soliloquy about how he always keeps his word.
<ul><li> Frequently Yami Yugi's reasoning, combined with a sense of responsibility. He makes a promise to the spirit of Dark Magician Girl in one of the filler arcs and at one point states he has a promise to keep.
</li></ul></li><li> Jonouchi <em>seriously</em> did this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhR">Yu-Gi-Oh! R</a></em>. In the beginning of the story, he borrowed a Duel Disk from Tilla Mook, the first Card Professor, promising he'd return it. Unfortunately, he lost it over the course of the story but gained the far superior Black Duel Disk created by Tenma after defeating Bandit Keith. Despite the value of this Disk, he later gave it to Mook in the epilogue to replace the one he lost, as he considered himself bound to his promise. (And as you might expect, she didn't mind at all.)

Despite being likely a thousand times more powerful than Yuma, and blaming him for Astral's injuries, he agreed to duel Yuma, so long as Yuma was willing to wager his memories of Astral. Without a doubt, Eliphas' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveSupernaturalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveSupernaturalPowers">ability to use Shining Draw whenever he wanted</a> was blatant cheating (clearly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">he didn't have as much regard for Law as he thought he did</a>) but Yuma still won, and claiming to be a man of his word, Eliphas kept his side of the bargain and released Astral.

<ul><li> Luffy zigzags this Trope. <em>Usually</em> he keeps his word, but he <em>has</em> broken it a few times. At two different points in the series, he's been forced to promise not to fight on a certain island. Both times he ended up getting angry enough that he broke his promise anyway, with particularly bad consequences in the second case. It's not that he's unreliable: he'll fight to the death against seemingly unbeatable odds to protect a friend, but he tends to do things his own way regardless of what other people think of it. (In Luffy's mind, this is both justified and simple. When others <em>make</em> him give his word, he'll usually only give it in order to shut them up and later either forget about it or simply do the opposite thing because he considers that better. When he gives his word <em>on his own</em> without any prompting, you can be sure he'll keep it forever.)
</li><li> One particular case where this Trope applies (and probably the most well-known among the fandom, considering its aftermath), is when Hachi made Luffy promise to not antagonize the World Nobles, no matter what they do. Luffy <em>was</em> planning on keeping this one, considering that if he didn't, an admiral would show up on the island. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">And then one of them shot Hachi</a>.

Unfortunately for her, Charlie Brown <em>did</em> get better, he <em>did</em> hear it somehow (maybe Linus told him) and held her to it; the amazing thing is, she actually tried to keep her word, but Charlie Brown missed, kicking her in the hand. (He apologized, to which she replied, "The next time you go to the hospital, stay there!" and apparently, she decided she wasn't bound by the promise anymore, because the annual prank continued as always, starting the next year.)

Then they find the queen and princess and learn that actually the queen has the smaller foot.

<ul><li> The same could be said of the Ring itself. Gollum also swore never to let Sauron have it. Sauron was coming for the Ring when Gollum had it. ....there was only one way to keep the vow, even if Gollum doesn't realize it.
</li><li> One more, though more of a curse than a promise: After Gollum attacks Frodo on the slope of Mount Doom, Frodo says that if Gollum ever lays hands on him again, he himself will "perish in the fire." And Gollum does. And guess what happens to him moments later.

<ul><li> Generally speaking, if a member of the Barrayarran upper-class says "My word as Vor", they <em>mean it</em>. In fact, this is the basis for Barrayar's entire legal system. When a Vor gives you his word, it has the force of a signed contract — and if he fails to keep his promise, he can be sued for breach of contract. It's also the basis of their Government: Vor Counts and Lords give their words to their Emperor that they will serve him — even if the Emperor is, at the time, a frightened young boy. Miles explains the metaphysics of the idea at one point; "Your breath is your life. What you pledge with your breath, you pledge with your life."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> includes a massacre of prisoners who had surrendered on Aral Vorkosigan's personal word of honor.

Cordelia remarks on the fact that there had been a time when he would never have given his word falsely. Than again, as a Count's heir and arguably in the line of succession for emperor, highly sensitive political information is absolutely relevant to anyone considering marrying him.

One of them mentions that they had given their words, and Gregor interjects "You took their oaths?" If Lord Dono had, in fact, accepted formal oaths of allegiance from his men, he would have been guilty of breaking a law that would see him <em>condemned to death</em>. By public exposure and starvation, no less. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> saves the day; "Our <em>personal</em> oaths, sire.

It's a survivor's problem, as Miles puts it, since sooner or later a philosophy based on "death before dishonor" inevitably forces one to choose between being dead or forsworn.

It seems one of the advantages of being powered by a Fallen Angels that you <em>can</em> go back on your word with no negative repercussions, but the downside of that is that, since you are being powered by a <em>Fallen Angel</em>, you go back so often it no longer has any meaning at all.
<ul><li> In <em>Changes</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Red King</span> is able to get around this by speaking through a translator.

(And, given the timing of when this was stated, not much <em>could</em> be done.)
</li><li> 'Gentleman Johnny' Marcone also holds to this. In one side story, people who had paid him protection money were being targeted by a rival, so he made sure that they were protected... by <em>personally</em> going after the party responsible.

<ul><li> This is not universal, as both Zeus and Poseidon break a vow made this way. The thing is, breaking this kind of a promise is really bad, and the fates will try and find a way to punish whoever broke it (though it's never shown exactly <em>what</em> happens in these books, <em>Theogony</em> has the answer). It helps that technically, it's Zeus who is supposed to judge whether the oath has been broken, and as characters point out, no way is he going to punish himself <em>or</em> his brother (though that does not stop Zeus from being cranky with Percy the first time they meet to try and recover his bruised ego, nor from threatening to kill Percy if he ever flies again.)
</li><li> Hades in general will honor his debts. He's also the only one of his brothers who didn't break the vow to not have any more kids post 1945.

</li><li> The Oath of Fëanor: Fëanor and his sons swear to recover the Silmarils. It leads them to slaughter other Elves three times, which is not only despicable in itself (which they know) but also very much hinders their own quest in the long term. Ultimately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fëanor and all but two of his sons die attempting to fulfill the oath.

</li><li> There is also The Unbreakable Vow, a more literal version of this trope. The Unbreakable Vow is a spell that forces a person into this trope. If the person who gives his word goes back on it, he/she dies. Period.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, the Aes Sedai are made to swear on an artifact known as the Oath Rod, one of the oaths being to never tell a lie. Even though they pride themselves on the ability to get around the oath, if they ever give a promise, they mean it because the magic of the oath prevents them from lying.
<ul><li> Specifically, the oath is to "speak no word that is not true". This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">notably does NOT exclude</a> insinuations along the lines of "some say X", lies of omission, or encouraging misconceptions through ambiguous phrasing.
<ul><li> And as a result <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a>, since no one who knows them well enough trusts them unless they give a clear unambiguous answer (which is rare).
</li></ul></li><li> It's a misconception that Aes Sedai can't break their promises. The First Oath means that an Aes Sedai can't give her word unless she intends to keep it at the time that she gives it, but there's nothing that prevents her from later changing her mind.

He assembles an army to track her across the entire continent and force her to fulfill the promise. It takes him a painfully long time to realize that this is because he's in love with her, not the principle of the thing.
</li><li> Mat Cauthon and company (including Aes Sedai and Seanchan captives, among others) are being chased by the Seanchan at one point (kidnapping a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seanchan princess</span> would do that).

When that one (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Seanchan Princess</span>) later asks him why he had no such orders for her, he says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTrust">he remembers that she gave her word one book ago that she would stay hidden by any means necessary.</a> This is an uncanny show of savvy for a series characterised by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarsAndVenusGenderContrast">Mars-and-Venus Gender Contrast</a> and constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball-ing</a> and really elevates her esteem of him.

Jane spends two years constantly finding excuses to delay the wedding until she and Clayton are shipwrecked on a (seemingly) deserted African coast, and she finally tells him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">it's ridiculous for anyone to expect her to marry a man she doesn't love just because she promised she would, that her forcing herself to keep her promise has only made them both miserable,</a> and she's retracting her earlier, "Yes."

Dukat is so furious that his daughter would choose a promise to an enemy of her family over obeying her father that he abandons her on the station even though he has secret information that the station is about to become very, very vulnerable.

The Romulan commander, however, is having none of this, until an elder Klingon reminds him that he gave <em>his</em> word years ago, and has never broken it.

Most artists, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">find Yankovic's riffs on them hilarious</a>, respond positively. However, there have been instances when the singer in question didn't give Yankovic an OK to publish or record a piece. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, a dedicated vegetarian, refused to allow "Live and Let Die" to become "Chicken Pot Pie," while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>, one of Yankovic's biggest fans (he even let him use the <em>same set</em> as "Bad" for the parody "Fat"), felt uncomfortable with "Black and White" being turned into "Snack All Night," as the song's message of racial harmony didn't lend itself to jokes. The only thing keeping Yankovic from recording and profiting off those songs is his personal promise and creed—and that is enough for him, which has contributed to his reputation as one of the best in the business.

If they don't, the punishment as described by the <em>Theogony</em> is one year of being conscious but unable to move, then 7-9 more of being barred from the presence of other gods and Olympus, and being barred from eating ambrosia/drinking nectar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Hera</a> tricked Dionysus' mother Semele into making Zeus swear by the Styx to show her his true, divine, form — which burned her to a crisp.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em>, it's why the Greeks went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a> - Odysseus decided that the only way to avoid war over who should marry Helen of Troy was to make all of her suitors promise that they would abide by her father's decision (whoever it was) and go to war against anyone who would abduct her. They all agreed, and it was a good idea - after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">who would be stupid enough to face all the armies of Greece for one lady?</a>

Medea replied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">he was breaking his marriage vow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">and made him pay</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of tricksters: even Loki of Norse Mythology kept his word once given. In one myth Loki is captured by the giant Geirrod and held captive until he agrees to give his word that he will lead Thor — who at this point in time is Loki's friend — to the giant's lair, without his hammer or mighty girdle. Once released, there was no reason Loki couldn't have run off or at least warned Thor what was going on, but he was forced to keep his word.
<ul><li> Much like the Greek gods above, the Norse gods, giants, spirits and monsters were, in general, bound to their vows as intangible things are impossible to break... which is why Odin was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>: Because he could bind people to his service by extracting vows from them, but could break whatever promises he made to them.

Without consulting God, they made a treaty of peace and found out about the deception three days later. Because of the oath, they could not attack them and defended them when they were attacked by the Amorites. They still were able to make them work as woodcutters and water carriers, however.
</li><li> Sir Gawain, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>'s knights, kept his side of the bargain he made with the Green Knight and went to meet him, even though he was led to believe it would result in his death.

Gawain would not surrender to the woman's charms and betray his host, but when she gives him a girdle which she claims will protect his life, <em>that</em> is too much of a temptation, and he doesn't give it to the Knight.)

True Fae give shape to their surroundings in Arcadia through the force of their agreements, and this is often how they ensnare their victims- binding them, often involuntarily, to agreements that their victims <em>must</em> abide by.

</li><li> Although sluagh have a reputation of being liars and slanderers, when a sluagh says something and gives his word that it's true, it's very likely to be true. This is because the sluagh strive to maintain excellence in their role as information brokers of the Fae. The splatbook for the sluagh notes how dreadful consequences await both those fae who would accuse a sluagh of lying after confirming the truth of a situation and those sluagh who would guarantee the truth after having lied. While sluagh are under no supernatural obligation to lie or to tell the truth, sluagh pride themselves as being information merchants of the highest caliber, and they are quick to literally cut out the tongues of their own peers who would dare to deliberately claim true a falsehood. Likewise, sluagh don't appreciate outsiders accusing them of lying simply because they speak an unpleasant or inconvenient truth. Such accusers risk having their own tongues cut out, or exposed to a sanity-destroying fright, or, worst of all, having all of their darkest, most embarrassing skeletons in their closets set loose upon the world.

It was a major blow for him and his party, and the "word of honor" became a meme on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> allegedly not having had "[...]sexual relations with that woman[...]"
</li><li> Curious historical etymology- partly why (until very recently) Bankers were held in such high esteem was that they were punctilious about keeping their word. The London Stock Exchange itself has the motto, "My word is my bond" inscribed over the entrance, which is the origin of the phrase. Because there were so few bankers in a very close-knit professional community, breaking your word led you to very soon to be unable to practice as a Banker in England. Incidentally, the lack of documents inherent in such Gentlemen's agreements led to very frustrated English Lawyers, but that's another story.
<ul><li> See <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em> for a verbal agreement among bankers.
</li></ul></li><li> Subtle but important point, a verbal contract is any contract which is expressed in words (written or spoken). An oral contract is one that is spoken. This is often confused.
</li><li> Samuel Goldwyn said, "An oral contract is as good as the paper it's written on," but this is not always the case:
<ul><li> Getting down to basics, under most legal systems, an oral contract is just as binding as a written one, assuming it satisfies the elements of contract formation of the jurisdiction. (Most legal systems will not enforce a bare promise; something akin to the common-law requirement of consideration—that is, giving something in exchange for the promise—is usually needed to establish a contract).
</li><li> Those legal niceties aside, the downside of oral contracts is evidentiary. With an oral contract, the only evidence a contract ever existed comes from whoever heard the parties talking. If the only people in the room were the parties themselves, it will be one person's word against the other's, and the case will revolve entirely around the credibility of the parties—that is, whose story the finder of fact (which can be a jury or a judge, depending on the nature of the contract and the jurisdiction) finds more believable at trial. Since the party alleging the contract is usually the plaintiff and therefore has the burden of proof at trial, the finder of fact will usually find for the party denying a contract unless that party seriously undermines their credibility (e.g. by denying obviously true facts or by being shady or inconsistent about what happened). Moreover, making it as far as trial is pretty expensive, or at least time-consuming, so parties will only get that far if the contract was really worth spending months or years in court.
</li><li> That said, if there are witnesses supporting the existence or terms of an oral contract, such contracts can be worth it to enforce. For example, in 1984 after Getty Oil was sold to Pennzoil in a handshake deal, Texaco made a higher offer, and the company was sold to Texaco. Pennzoil filed a lawsuit alleging tortuous interference with this oral contract, which the court upheld and awarded $11.1 billion in damages, later reduced to $9.1 billion, but increased again by interest and penalties. (Texaco ultimately filed for bankruptcy in part because of this judgment but mostly because of its inability to meet its other obligations; Pennzoil agreed to accept a "mere" $3 billion as a bankruptcy settlement of the liability.)
</li><li> Finally, some jurisdictions do place limits on what kind of contracts can be made orally. In common-law jurisdictions, this is usually regulated by the Statute of Frauds, which require six types of contracts to be written down. These are: (1) Contracts in consideration of marriage (i.e. prenups); (2) contracts that cannot be executed one year or less (the exact meaning of which leads to all kinds of charming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>); (3) contracts transferring an interest in land; (4) contracts requiring the executor of a dead person's estate to pay the estate's debts with his/her own money; (5) contracts for the sale of goods valued above a certain amount (it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—$500.00 is common in the U.S.) and (6) contracts making one party a surety (i.e. guarantor) for the other's debts.
</li></ul></li><li> Daredevil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EvelKnievel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EvelKnievel">Evel Knievel</a> wasn't a bad guy, but he believed in a lot of "core values", as he called them, one of which was the importance of always keeping his word. He stated that although he knew he may not have successfully made or even survived his ill-fated Snake River Canyon jump, he followed through with it and every other stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the Canyon jump, Knievel stated, "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word."
</li><li> Parole may have different meanings depending on the field and judiciary system. All of the meanings originated from the French parole ("voice", "spoken word"). Following its use in late-resurrected Anglo-French chivalric practice, the term became associated with the release of prisoners based on prisoners giving their word of honor to abide by certain restrictions.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway">Norway</a>, the new king as a rule pledges allegiance to the Norwegian constitution. This tradition began in 1814, with Christian Frederick, king elect, who was sworn in immediately after the constitution was finished and signed. This tradition paid back on two dramatic occasions. First for Christian Frederick himself, who was honor-bound to protect the constitution and to rule by it, and therefore had to resign when the treaty of Kiel came into play in the summer of 1814.
<ul><li> The second time was even more awesome: When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> occupied Norway in April 1940, King Haakon VII, who <em>also</em> had sworn allegiance to the Norwegian constitution, had to face the German claims, he stated: <em>I choose to fight you under the terms of the constitution I have honorably sworn allegiance to. Either that, or abdication!</em> Thus, his given word secured continuous resistance against the occupying forces, which bolstered the resistance for the rest of the war - that is <em>the entire war</em>!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23957605">Robert Campbell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a British prisoner of war during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. Having been captured by the Germans, he received news that his mother was dying of cancer. He wrote a letter to the German Kaiser asking to be released so he could say his last goodbyes to her. He was granted his release, on one condition: that he return to the prison camp. Campbell agreed, giving his word he would return. Since being a prisoner of war is one of the many reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>, Campbell had every reason to break his promise and not return to the German prison camp. But he gave his word he would return, and return he did. He felt that, as an officer, he was honor-bound to keep his promise. However, as soon as he returned, he immediately attempted to break out, since he also felt that, as a prisoner of war, he was honor-bound to escape.
</li><li> Some colleges are operating on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_honor_code">honor system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, meaning that every student has to sign the honor code and that consequently the administration will not intervene on the sanctions system but leave the student-run Honor Council give penalties. One of the consequences of this system is that examinations are made without staff watch, the students being trusted enough.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar">Simón Bolívar</a> was big on this. If he swore something, he would do it, to the best of his ability:
<ul><li> When his wife died, he swore he would never remarry. While he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">took his liberties with the adoring ladies</a> and took several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">mistresses</a> (most famously Pepita Machado and Manuela Sáenz), he never did remarry.
</li><li> On a visit to Italy in his youth (a little after his wife passed), he stood on the hill where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">the first secession of the plebs had occurred</a> (according to Livy anyway) and swore an oath to liberate his country from Spanish rule or die trying. He succeeded.
</li><li> While in exile in Haiti after one of his multiple defeats in Venezuela, the Haitian government told him they would provide him with arms, ships, and money for his cause if he promised to fight for the abolition of slavery in the lands he freed from Spanish rule. While it's not clear if he took an oath, he definitely promised, and he kept his word. Wherever he was leading liberating armies in South America, he insisted that some form of abolition was part of the constitution, and while slavery lingered in Spanish-speaking South America for decades after his death, the path to abolition was laid out by him. (This was no small thing for Bolívar, as he was one of the biggest slaveholders in Venezuela.)
