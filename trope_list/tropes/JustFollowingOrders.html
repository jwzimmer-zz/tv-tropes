This justification holds that the (bulk of the) responsibility for such actions falls upon those who make such decisions and give such orders within a (military) hierarchy; by extension, those who obey and act upon such orders cannot be held (entirely) accountable for their actions. Often invoked with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase">exact phrase</a> "I was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Just Following Orders</a>." Also known as the "Nuremberg Defense" because a notable flaw of the immediate post-war German penal code was that the worst category of murder and its attendant sentences ("first-degree murder") could only be "for base motives" (hatred, bloodlust, greed, etc.), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">which did not include "dispassionate" participation in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">mass murder</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0frb0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0frb0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0frb0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was subject to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> later on. Modern laws tend to distinguish between "degrees" of murder according to prior intent/planning instead, with one's emotional or rational reasons for the murder(s) taking a back-seat. Indeed, Common Law does not distinguish between types of murder at all (though the motivations do of course affect the sentencing).</span> Perpetrator testimony and the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram Experiment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1jr9i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1jr9i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1jr9i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> More specifically, the series of experiments in which the test subject operated alongside two other "test subjects" (actors) and in the absence of supervision from the 'scientist' running the experiment. Interestingly, the very best results in compliance (near-total) were reached in the series where the test subjects were asked to perform tasks which only "enabled" the shocks to be administered, such as setting the dial on the shock machine to a level indicated by the "scientist" </span> indicate that even when the desire to conform with the group is a major or primary reason for someone carrying out an immoral group action, they almost always frame their compliance in terms of obedience to authority. They believed that obedience to authority at least partly justified or excused immoral behavior, and that desire to conform did not.

This was the choice presented to the 'Hiwis' (conscripted from Soviet POW and civilians), Jewish Police (recruited by the Jewish Councils from the ghetto populations), and 'Sonderkommando' (recruited from Extermination Camp inmates). This is why the surviving Hiwis, Jewish Police, and Sonderkommando were never tried for War Crimes or Crimes Against Humanity, but some of the senior commanders of the German troops who supervised them (volunteers legally and practically entitled to opt out, as many did) were.

</p><p>This trope is by now usually not played straight but instead cowardly, ironically, sarcastically, or self-hatingly. Still, it's one of the tropes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope">cycles</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">Undead Horse Trope</a>, because the dilemma it rests on is close to unresolvable. Quoting the trope by name, though, is likely to be met with skepticism and ridicule. If the "crime" being excused is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">relatively minor one</a>, though, then an accuser invoking a parallel with Nuremberg may be seen as invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Godwin's Law</a>.
</p><p>Often the de facto justification of those who believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">My Master, Right or Wrong</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a>, or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">I Did What I Had to Do</a>".

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> may well end up saying this at some point depending on who he serves.

In the English dub version, this sounds plausible, because Freeza came up with the idea of destroying the Saiyans on his own. In the original Japanese version, this is nonsense, because Zarbon and Dodoria were the ones who planted the idea that the Saiyans were a threat that needed to be destroyed in Freeza's head in the first place. Either way, Vegeta is not impressed and simply kills Zarbon by shooting through him.

Riza replies that, yes, the Homunculi may have started it, but they were the ones who carried it out, and that is something they will never forget.

Issei doesn't buy it for a second, but just can't bring himself to kill her after the day of love and happiness they shared... so he asks Rias to do it instead.

Both the prosecution and defense fully acknowledge that said killings took place, but the issue determining the guilt of the Carbineers is whether the acts were committed because of an informal order from higher up to do so (in order to adapt in the face of a brutal guerrilla war, and also because they felt the prisoners couldn't be adequately fed alongside British soldiers) or if Morant ordered the killings purely out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> for the death and mutilation of a good friend and fellow officer.

</div></li><li> Averted with Travis in "Trial". He admits that he was acting on his own initiative when he committed the atrocity he's being court-martialed for, but says that his actions were the result of the training and indoctrination that the Federation military had given him. "If I'm guilty of murder, then so are you!" One of his soldiers however plays the trope straight. "He gave the order. We just did the shooting."

Upon learning this, she goes completely overboard and personally crucifies him by explicitly telling his fiancée of his sex offender registration, who then tells his boss and he is fired, and tries to make the evidence point to him as the criminal. Many members of her team continuously point this out, claiming she is not listening to how his alibi checks out or the fact that one sarcastically comments how it is fun to watch how she is just making the evidence fit her theory. In the end it was her actions alone that destroyed his life. Although cleared of the murder charge, the man's life is effectively ruined by the revelation. When, at the end of the episode, he confronts her over all this and she offers the justification that she was just doing her job, he finds this... unconvincing:

After the truth is discovered and "Milgram" is arrested, he manages to get away. It's eventually revealed that the reason he's doing all this is because, when his wife was in labor, he saw that something was wrong and asked the doctor to do something, only for the doctor to brush him off and say that everything was fine. His wife and their unborn child died from complications, resulting in the man blaming both the doctor (naturally) and himself (for obeying someone just because he was in a position of authority).

<ul><li> Used by General Hammond in the pilot episode.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">he shortly after has second thoughts and relents rather than kill thousands of people unnecessarily</a>.
</li><li> Invoked by Jack O'Neill in the episode "Cor'Ai", where Teal'c stood trial on another world for crimes he committed there while under the service of the Goa'uld:
<div class="indent"><strong>O'Neill:</strong> Teal'c, there are a lot things we do that we wish we could change and we sure as hell can't forget, but the whole concept of chain of command undermines the idea of free will. So as soldiers, we have to do some pretty awful stuff. But we're following orders like we were trained to. It doesn't make it easier; it certainly doesn't make it right, but it does put some of the responsibility on the guy giving those orders.
</div></li><li> Perhaps even more interestingly, Jack uses this justification as part of his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hammond:</strong> These people's laws in this regard are no different from our own. We don't stop pursuing war criminals because they have a change of heart. <br/><strong>O'Neill:</strong> "War criminals"?! <br/><strong>Hammond:</strong> Yes, Colonel, he is. Like it or not, what the Jaffa have done to these people and thousands of other people is a <em>crime.</em> Now Teal'c spent many years serving the Goa'uld doing some <em>damned</em> distasteful things. Surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later. <br/><strong>O'Neill:</strong> General Hammond, <strong>I</strong> have spent a lot of years in the service of <strong>my</strong> country, and <strong>I</strong> have been ordered to do "some <strong>damned</strong> distasteful things".
</div></li><li> Interestingly, Teal'c doesn't use this justification himself. He did a lot of awful things while in the service of the Goa'uld and he always takes full responsibility, even going so far as to willingly submit to execution in "Cor'ai". In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArkOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArkOfTruth">The Ark of Truth</a></em>, he has this conversation with a former soldier for the Ori (Vala's ex-husband Tomin, who in one episode ordered the summary execution of villagers who refused to submit to Origin).

<ul><li> Famously used by Nazi defendants during the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials, which gave us the term <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defense">"Nuremberg Defense"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> At the Nuremberg trials, it was established that "just following orders" is a valid defense, but only below the rank of lieutenant, and only if the orders in question are not clearly illegal. Many times the accused said that they followed orders because it was either work in the camps or the front line.
</li><li> In a subversion, the Nazis who gave birth to this trope weren't the ones who were Just Following Orders but the ones who impressed their superiors enough with their enthusiasm to be assigned to running concentration camps. The ones who were <em>just</em> following orders ended up at the Russian Front, and usually didn't survive to reach Nuremberg in the first place.
</li><li> Some historians who have interviewed ex-Nazis, or supporters or collaborators of the regime, have reported that the subjects are very often <em>proud</em> of what was done and either don't use this defence or only used it as an excuse if they don't want to attract bad attention. Notably, some of those same historians have also interviewed former Soviet and Japanese soldiers who <em>also</em> took part in atrocities and generally conclude that this trope suits them better, since in the former case you could be sent to the Gulag or shot if you were suspected of being "un-revolutionary", and in the latter case one's superiors savagely beating their subordinates and treating them like dirt was the rule rather than the exception. In contrast, while in some cases not following orders could get you sent to the very dangerous Eastern Front, the majority of SS and Wehrmacht soldiers were often not severely punished and very usually had no problem with what they were doing; indeed, in many, many cases, they <em>exceeded</em> their orders and many atrocities were initiated at ground-level by officers. Since conquered Jews, Poles and other victims were forbidden to work (slave labour aside) yet were now part of the Greater German Reich, they became an economic burden, and since deportation was increasingly impractical, mass murder was often seen as cheaper and easier. The majority of Holocaust victims were shot, in thousands of separate instances; roughly half of its millions of victims were dead before Auschwitz opened its gas chambers.
</li><li> As it happens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> <em>hated</em> giving orders and liked to keep them as vague as possible, leading to what historian Ian Kershaw called "working towards the Fuhrer", i.e. "doing what you <em>think</em> Hitler wants", which as it happens was usually just "anything that made the problem go away". A common problem, even in the early days of the regime, was that the SA, the SS and the more ideological members of the Party and the army would assault or kill more people than the leaders intended and had to be reined in (this was one of the reasons the SA was purged on Night of the Long Knives, as they were considered too unruly compared to the "disciplined" SS). The initial plan for the occupation of Poland — then Eastern Europe — was to kill a certain percentage of various Polish social groups (e.g. Jews, academics, officers, lawyers etc.) and have the rest either deported or kept as slave labour (and/or held as hostages) while their land would be given to "ethnic" Germans, but the SS and sections of the German army ended up killing so much that even <em>Himmler</em> protested to Hitler (albeit on the grounds that it showed a lack of discipline). Eventually, for many, committing genocide simply became <em>normal</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>: Henry Wirz, commandant of the notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Andersonville POW camp</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, claimed that he was only following orders when the victorious Union finally put him on trial. It didn't work any better for him than it did for the Nazi officers at Nuremberg eighty years later; he was hanged after a trial whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">probable unfairness</a> was made a moot point by the fact that he probably <em>wasn't</em> under orders to be that nasty anyway. Critics have also pointed out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrisy</a> in this, as many Union prison camps were also hell holes, but naturally the commanders there were never punished for mistreating POWs.
</li><li> The US Military specifically states that following an order you know to be illegal (such as shooting civilians) denies you the use of this defense: you knew it was wrong and failed to refuse the order. It's failure to follow <em>lawful</em> orders that gets you punished—if an officer has to use a gun to make the troops follow orders, it's clearly not lawful. Only extreme coercion from the commanding officer can possibly be an exception.
</li><li> The Canadian Forces have a very similar law as the US example above about only following lawful orders. They also practice "Due Diligence", which requires a soldier to understand what would and wouldn't be a lawful order, and said soldier will be punished for following an unlawful order even if he believed 100% that it was a lawful one.
</li><li> For most UN member nations and all NATO countries without exception, soldiers refusing an order can't be punished beyond being suspended with pay until a tribunal actually rules on the legality of the order. Superior officer retaliation is often functionally impossible and usually illegal under national-level law, too. Essentially, modern law is specifically designed with averting this situation in mind.
<ul><li> If a soldier does injure or kill the commanding officer in charge though, they can usually be cleared simply because those orders don't put you in a good position, and doing the right thing helps everybody else when the military court will agree it was the right thing.
</li><li> A cynic might observe that war criminals aren't really punished for what they did; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">they are punished for losing the war</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> When top SS officer and Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann was brought to trial in Israel in 1961 after 15 years on the lam, he used the Nuremberg defense. Depositions from other SS officers, however, shot holes through even that defense.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce">Christmas Truces<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in World Wars I and II were proof that many soldiers on both sides had no interest in killing each other outside of being ordered to do so. Many of these truces actually had the armies from both sides venturing out into No-Man's Land together to bury fallen comrades, exchange gifts, play football, and even <em>sing carols.</em> The next year, the respective armies were ready to punish soldiers if they tried it again, but by then, the soldiers were ready to fight, since the mood was darker as the war went on.
</li><li> The New York City Police Department (NYPD) marched to protest a few of their fellow cops being charged with sweeping crimes under the rug. The slogan on their sign was the name of this very trope. Analogues to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Nazi Germany</a> were <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/5854503/dear-nypd-just-following-orders-is-not-a-good-slogan">not far behind<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Stanley Milgram's infamous psychological experiment in obedience, which tested whether people would willingly administer what they thought were painful or even harmful electrical shocks to another person if ordered to do so by an apparently knowledgeable authority. Over and over again, the majority of subjects were seen to follow the experimenter's instructions through to the end, although the "victim" voiced their protests, and even claimed to have a heart condition that could <em>kill them</em> if the shocks got too strong.
<ul><li> It was originally thought that obedience to authority led the participants in said experiment to act the way they did, however <a class="urllink" href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001426">newer evidence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggests that identification with the experimenter and his research goals led them to continue with the experiment. Or to quote the authors of this essay:
<div class="indent">"Our desire to be good subjects is stronger than our desire to be subjects who do good."
</div></li><li> More recently, Milgram's results have been cast into doubt however, and its possible that the results were misinterpreted and that some of the subjects only continued because they knew or strongly suspected that the shocks weren't real anyway.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5sqod');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5sqod" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5sqod');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While the full details are complicated and open to interpretation (and you should check <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> for more details), the experiment had a number of factors that should be taken into account when considering the results, including the fact that all testers were assured that there would be no permanent physical damage from their actions at all. That, combined with the testing methods and the interpretation of the results by Milgram, as well as multiple repeated experiments with different factors and modes of operation, have thrown the psychology of the original experiment for a loop, such that it's important to remember that it was <em>only one experiment</em>. Milgram himself performed <em>nineteen</em> variations on the original test, with occasionally drastically different results, and there have been many different replications since then with also very different results.</span>
</li><li> This can be an even stronger motivation for immoral behavior than just being forced into obedience. Also, the belief that it is for a higher good, be it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">science</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies">an ideology</a>, motivates people to transgress moral norms.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> were particularly good at setting up a system that rewards ideological fellowship over blind obedience: In the Nazi bureaucracy, orders often weren't formulated explicitly. Instead they vaguely formulated goals and had their subordinates do what is necessary to achieve them. Of course, this also seen as playing a major party in why they were ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">Fascist, but Inefficient</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Another famous experiment, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanfordPrisonExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanfordPrisonExperiment">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>, appeared to demonstrate that even ordinary people given authority over their peers can become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnPower">Drunk On Power</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">even when they go back to normal lives outside of the prison</a></em>. More recent experiments have shown that one is more likely to abuse authority if the position involves power without respect and/or prestige (e.g. traffic cops, the DMV, staff managers). This means they won't get in trouble if caught and are unlikely to lose much even if they do. Or they hate the job so much they just don't care.
<ul><li> Anyone who has ever worked in any of the positions just listed will tell you that this cuts both ways. Because, say, a traffic warden, a staff manager, a low-level security guard at an airport, or a DMV teller is held in contempt by the public, this sometimes gives members of the public the idea that they can order you around or that normal rules don't apply to them.
</li><li> In places where the business owners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">hire all sort of illiterate goons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bouncer">as bouncers or security guards</a>, they quickly become textbook examples of this. Usually the patron or client is a guy or girl with money, schooling and appropriate appearance and knows he or she faces a semi-literate goon, so consciously or not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">will treat him with contempt</a>. When the said bouncer or guard has reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">to employ his power</a>, things get ugly.
</li></ul></li><li> The job doesn't even need any kind of power or prestige. This is the only real defense bottom-rung employees such as cashiers, waiters, and the like have against rude customers. If a customer starts berating them for something completely out of their control (prices, the room temperature, a policy they don't like), the only thing the completely-powerless employee can say is "It's store policy/management's decision/up to the boss."
</li><li> Jiang Qing, wife of Chairman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a>, attempted this defense when the Gang of Four was put on trial after Mao's death. It didn't work.
<div class="indent"> "I was Chairman Mao's dog. I bit whomever he asked me to bite."
</div></li><li> The entire Romanian political police got away with everything they did after '89, because they were just following orders. Interestingly, the people whose orders they followed suddenly turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a>, and promptly executed the Ceausescu couple as an act of justice. It worked. Nobody else was brought to trial for their atrocities.
</li><li> Many of the torturers in S-21 prison were brainwashed teenage boys whose families were being held hostage by Pol Pot. They were told to either follow orders or they and their whole families would have the same fate as the prisoners. In later interviews, this trope is their justification, saying that they too were prisoners. It falls apart when one of the few survivors confronts his captor.
</li><li> James Fred Blake was only a bus driver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">in Alabama</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">One day in 1943, a black woman called Parks boarded the bus and paid the fare. She then moved to her seat, but Blake told her to follow city rules and enter the bus again from the back door</a>. Parks exited the bus, but before she could re-board at the rear door, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Blake drove off, leaving her to walk home in the rain.</a> Understandably, Parks didn't like it. On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain">December 1, 1955</a> they encountered each other again when Blake ordered Rosa Parks and three other black people to move from the middle to the back of his Cleveland Avenue bus in order to make room for a white passenger. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">Rosa Parks defied his orders</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">prompting the Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>. Commenting on the event afterwards, Blake stated:
<div class="indent">"I wasn't trying to do anything to that Parks woman except do my job. She was in violation of the city codes, so what was I supposed to do? That damn bus was full and she wouldn't move back. I had my orders."
</div><ul><li> The whole idea of buses forcing black passengers to the back was an example as well, and more sympathetically. Most riders were black and the bus companies didn't want to offend their primary ridership. They only started enforcing the rules once Alabama police began boarding buses and arresting drivers for ignoring it.
</li></ul></li><li> There was at least one incident of an employee cutting off some branches from a couple of trees, damaging the cars parked underneath them in the process. The employee claimed he was ordered to cut the branches and had no other choice but to follow the orders, and his boss is responsible for everything.
<ul><li> The employee might have been charged with cutting the branches, but he also had a responsibility to do his job in a manner that avoids harming his boss/organization.
</li></ul></li><li> Lawyers by law and ethical norm are required to use a version of this. While lawyers can resign from service (usually) of any particular client, an attorney is expected, within certain outer limits, to engage in whatever morally-questionable-but-legal tactics will best serve his clients' interests. This could include making a child witness cry so as to convince prosecutors to give your client a better deal to protect them from you or it could include burying the other side in discovery to make pursuing a case against your client extremely time consuming. The justification is built into the ethical norms of the profession: you are your clients' advocate, and therefore must help them to the greatest legal extent possible. This ethical weirdness is the origin of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a> trope.
</li><li> This was the defense line of the soldiers and officers implicated in the Malet coup of 1812. For instance, Captain Borderieux stated:
<div class="indent">"Adjutant Limouzin gave us a series of actions to carry out (...) and brought orders, not from Malet, but from Colonel Rabbe, to follow his instructions. At once, I gathered my company and marched it to the Luxembourg. One hour later, I was told that the orders given to my colonel were illegal and I was told to go back to my barracks; I did so at once. How am I responsible?"
</div><ul><li> It should be noted that more than one century before Nuremberg, the military court took the defendants' age, experience and degree of information into account, thus acquitting all those under the rank of lieutenant while giving a death sentence to the senior officers who should have known better.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/militarylaw1/a/obeyingorders.htm">first recorded instance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a "just following orders" defense being used by US military personnel was relatively mundane but still legally important. In 1799 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War">the US was involved in an undeclared war with the French Republic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and Congress passed a law allowing the Navy to seize ships bound for any French port. President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnAdams">John Adams</a> issued an executive order to the Navy that exceeded this authority, telling them to seize vessels traveling <em>to or from</em> French ports. Under these orders the Navy seized a Danish merchant ship, the <em>Flying Fish</em>, whose owners then <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_v._Barreme">sued the Navy in US court and won.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The Supreme Court even weighed in, declaring that Navy officers "act at their own peril" when obeying illegal orders, even when those orders come from the President.
</li><li> In the aftermath of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre">My Lai Massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the most heinous atrocities during the Vietnam War where between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians were butchered by US forces, Lieutenant William Calley Jr., a platoon leader, pleaded he was just following the orders of his commanding officer, Captain Medina. This defense was rejected and he was sentenced to life in prison for 22 counts of murder. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Then the sentence was commuted to three and a half years under house arrest at Fort Benning, and no-one else was convicted of any charges in relation to the massacre.</a>
</li><li> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a survivor of the Soviet Union's gulags and a Nobel Prize winner, once reflected on who was a true believer in Communism's cruel ways, and who was merely complying out of fear.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnOliver">John Oliver</a> never comes out and says the exact words, but this is the heart of his defense of the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn_Zln_4pA8">IRS<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a></em>: everyone hates the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">Intimidating Revenue Service</a> for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaxmanTakesTheWinnings">take everyone's money</a>, but he sees them as an underfunded, understaffed, overworked group of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Beleaguered</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Bureaucrats</a> who are Just Following Orders — and not orders from their superiors in the IRS, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">orders given to them</a> by <em>Congress</em>; orders that they are constantly <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">changing</a>.</strong> It still makes for an interesting examination of the trope; though Oliver decries calling the IRS "Gestapo", one can see the similarity; most of the people who made the Nazi regime work were overworked bureaucrats. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_during_World_War_II">IBM even sold them the computers they used.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This trope is the cause of almost all programming/user errors. Computers follow their orders to the letter, exactly as written. They have no common sense at all, and so rely entirely upon their given orders. If those orders end up causing a system freeze or loss of data, it's not the computer's fault, as it's just following the directions given in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>.

After all, you can't be fired if you're just doing what your superiors were telling you to do. There's also a similar action called "work to rule" where workers will not work more than the minimum time and/or effort needed to complete the tasks assigned to them.
