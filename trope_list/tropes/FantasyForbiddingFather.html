</div></div><p>A father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">mother</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">guardian</a> (these last two are less common) disapproves of their child or ward reading "fairy stories", playing fantasy or sci-fi games, sports, and even such "useless" hobbies as astronomy, boxing, and <em>being literate</em>. In extreme cases, anything the child likes that isn't directly and concretely tied to whatever it is their parent does for a living (or that they want <em>them</em> to do for a living) is seen as an utter waste. The parent may even confiscate and dispose of anything of this nature their child owns. The child may then be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">grounded</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse">deprived of money</a> in a bid to prevent any clandestine attempts to continue the offending hobby. If the setting is one where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontMakeMeTakeMyBeltOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontMakeMeTakeMyBeltOff">Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off</a> is likely to come into play, expect the parent to tell the child that they will have "that nonsense" beaten out of them.

To the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a>, any and all of these "distractions" are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a> waiting to happen that will ruin their child's chances at life. For narrative purposes, this is basically anything that the kid likes that'll move the plot forward via alienating them from their parent (possible later reconciliation optional but heartwarming), which puts the Fantasy-Forbidding Parent into an antagonist role, though with rare exceptions he or she is not a true villain.
</p><p>In many cases, the parent probably sees their actions as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind">Cruel to Be Kind</a> by steering their child away from an "unsuitable" interest but is too close-minded or too terrified to consider that there are many valid careers and hobbies for their child and that the child should (within reason) be allowed to make their own decisions. In these cases, the parent does come around to accepting their child's interests and vocation with a little coaxing. If the kid later <em>really</em> hits the big time in those fields, the parent will probably shake their head wondering in astonishment how that is possible. However, with some more consideration as the parent sees their child's success with their talent, some apologies for their stubborn doubts and statements of pride are usually in order.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Otomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Otomen">Otomen</a></em>, the main character Asuka secretly loves knitting, embroidery, cute things, cooking, and girls' manga. It's a secret because Asuka's a guy, and his mother constantly warns him he must be <em>manly</em>, lest he ends up like his father who decided he wanted to be a woman and consequently left the family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: A flashback reveals that Gozaburo asked his adopted son Seto what he would do if he was in charge of Kaiba Corp. Kaiba says that he wants to make Kaibaland (which is very much like Disneyland) for kids to enjoy. However, Gozaburo is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a>, so he is completely unable to comprehend such a thing. So he decided to take away Kaiba's toys. Considering that Gozaburo was very abusive towards Seto at least, this would indicate that he simply wanted to keep Kaiba under his thumb. That Kaiba eventually overthrows him is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, that he would eventually build Kaibaland and it was successful is desecrating the grave of somebody who deserved it
</li><li> Hiroko's father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AKB49RenaiKinshiJourei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AKB49RenaiKinshiJourei">AKB49  Renai Kinshi Jourei</a></em> strongly disapproves of her aspiration to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a>, which led to a heated confrontation between him and her when he found out that she had joined an idol group.
</li><li> While they're not related, Tsubasa and Angie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiHaremAsuNoYoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiHaremAsuNoYoichi">Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi</a></em> fit this trope fairly well. Angie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker">The Caretaker</a> for Tsubasa, tries to keep anything that doesn't advance the latter's learning of martial arts away (such as manga), to the point where Tsubasa has a breakdown in one fight and basically cries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">I Just Want to Be Normal</a> after she experiences what it's like to be a normal schoolgirl for one day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, the two main reasons why Lucy Heartfilia runs away from home to join the titular guild are because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> father Jude won't spend time with her after her mother Layla's death and he wants to rein in Lucy's impulses to become a wizard by having her bear a son through an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>. To do this, he recruits rival guild Phantom Lord to retrieve her, but it inadvertently leads to a guild war between it and Fairy Tail one year later. Lucy, however, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">other ideas</a> when the guild war is over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> anime, Kyouya's father actually slaps him when he finds out exactly what his son's after-school club is about. In the manga, Tamaki's father forces the club to shut down briefly near the end, but it's subverted later when it's revealed that he likes the Host Club, and was only shutting them down as part of a plan to get his mother to step down as head of the company.
</li><li> Nagisa Motomiya's father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AKB0048" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AKB0048">AKB0048</a></em> is initially dead set against his daughter becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a>, but it's hard to blame him when the Motomiyas live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> where music is outlawed and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice">Culture Police</a> tend to shoot first and ask questions later, and his concerns are more about poor Nagisa's safety than anything else.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou">The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</a></em>, Nanami's parents do not support Nanami's aspirations to be a voice actress, which forced her to work for her own expenses in Tokyo. Sorata wonders if her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a> personality arises from this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em>, Nodoka's father doesn't think much of Mahjong, saying that it's purely a game of luck, that training camps are a waste of time, and that the friends Nodoka makes through it won't be of any use in a "hick town" like where she lives. He seems to tolerate her playing mahjong as long as it doesn't interfere with anything more important, and reluctantly decides to "consider" letting her stay where she is if she wins the nationals, though.
<ul><li> The prequel, <em></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakiShinohayuDawnOfAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakiShinohayuDawnOfAge">Saki Shinohayu -dawn of age-</a>'' has Shino's uncle, who tells her to get over Mahjong. He even tries to sell the Mahjong set which they used to play Mahjong together with (failing because it's missing a tile) and by 'they', this includes Shino's disappeared mom, as he believes that Mahjong will only serve to remind Shiho of her mother's absence and cause her pain. Ultimately, after seeing her participating in a tournament and enjoying herself despite not winning, he apologizes and returns the set.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Hana's mother is horrified by her pursuing tankery because she, head of the Isuzu school of flower arrangement, considers tanks barbaric, and disowns Hana when she makes it clear that she will not abandon it. She later undergoes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, reconciles with Hana after admitting that participating in tankery has helped her flower arranging, and actually seems to enjoy the match between Oarai and Black Forest.
</li><li> A few parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em> dislike their children getting involved in manga for various reasons, such as Mashiro's mother (out of the belief that she doesn't think he could succeed, and the death of her brother-in-law mangaka doesn't help either), and Shiratori's mother (who dislikes manga and thinks it would bring harm to the Shiratori family reputation).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, it's revealed that as children, Cody's father and Owikawa were aware of the digital world and dreamed of going there one day. Cody's grandfather, unaware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">the digital world was real</a>, thought this was an unrealistic obsession and ordered it to stop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Sanji's father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vinsmoke Judge</span>, detests Sanji's desire to be a chef, as the old man is obsessed with status and considers cooking a form of servitude. This seems to have only fueled Sanji's passion even further. He gets so fed up with his son feeding other people and random animals that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">locks Sanji up in a dungeon so Judge can forget Sanji even exists.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: The "Luxury Liner Serial Murder Case" has a fantasy-forbidding <em>grandfather</em> as the first victim.

Heck, he's even shown smashing one of Ichiro's works in a flashback, and openly badmouths the guy in front of Conan and the Mouris. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThedogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThedogBitesBack">Ichiro is the killer</a>: when he couldn't take the man's abuse anymore, he ended up grabbing a nearby knife and stabbing him to death. He has <em>two</em> reasons for it, actually: not only Gozo disapproved of his desires, but he wouldn't allow Ichiro to marry his cousin Natsue, Gozo's favorite relative and only heir.

Tsubame's parents don't approve, and make a deal with her- she has to pay her way through vocational school, and if she doesn't get hired at her first choice company(Eagle Jump, where the main characters work), she has to come home and inherit the inn. Her parents gradually ease up over time, as Tsubame's mother attends her graduation, and they later reimburse her for her tuition.

She says that she wants to pull him out of UA so that he can go to a normal school, even if that means he can never be a hero. Unlike most examples, she is portrayed as being <em>completely</em> justified. The school has been attacked multiple times since Izuku started going there, he was involved in a kidnapping attempt and a fight that leveled several city blocks, and every time he uses his power he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">shatters at least one bone</a>.

However, while he does think that "superhero" is an impractical job choice, he's also worried that they could get hurt — they're twelve years old at this point. There's also the risk that someone could find out about the family through the twins' activities — the last time that happened, two of the Clan died. In this case, the eventual solution is a compromise: the kids get to continue their superhero careers, but only when an adult relative can chaperone them.
</li><li> Dr. Manhattan's father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> could be seen as an example, or technically a Fantasy-<em>Fostering</em> Father. His son is at first eager to follow in his footsteps as a watchmaker, but he forces him to abandon this (by throwing his tools out the window of their apartment) and pursue a career as a nuclear scientist after the Atom bomb is dropped at the end of WWII. His father's reasoning was based on Einstein: what use is a watchmaker if time is an illusion? Interestingly enough, the chapter ends with Einstein's quote about how he should have become a watchmaker if he had known what his research would lead to.

She's overall a supporting parent but is very hesitant and strict when her daughter becomes a superhero, making sure she doesn't neglect her schoolwork. At one point, she even gains the ability to take away Cassie's powers if she needs to, making her a literal example of this trope. The two are estranged for a while when Wonder Girl is older, but eventually reconcile.

He only figured it out when he tore Tim's room to shreds after learning the football coach didn't remember Tim trying out for football and finding the hidden compartment in Tim's closet. Though in this particular case, one can perhaps forgive a father disapproving of his son's decision to secretly become a costumed vigilante crime-fighter and battling a series of lurid psychopathic supervillains, the fact that he wouldn't let Tim get any sci-fi or fantasy-themed toys as a child is considerably less forgivable.

However, this isn't so much due to grudging tolerance as the fact that he's terrified of his mother-in-law and brother-in-law, who wholeheartedly support her. He's more successful with his second child, Stevie, who's quite quiet and a budding artist, when his father wants him to be a rambunctious <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanBoy">All American Boy</a> like his youngest child, Joe Junior, dismissing his artistic talents as "girl's stuff" and encouraging his youngest son to do the same.

Richard never let her forget how disappointed he was with her, so Vanessa is obsessed with placating him by making sure Kat follows in her grandfather's footsteps. She repeatedly insists that Kat isn't in college to have fun. Kat's roommate convinces her to participate in a painting competition, where she earns first place and a free art class. Afraid of her mother finding out, she makes up a new identity and starts living a double life. Naturally, eventually her mother learns of this and takes her home while screaming at her and generally only caring about how this affects her (Vanessa) personally.

He apparently pulled some strings to prevent Garrus from pursuing this career after his mandatory military service was up, so he could join C-Sec like he did.
<ul><li> In a comic focused on Garrus, he remembers his childhood, with his father teaching him to shoot.

Then Garrus sees an N7 uniform in his scope and tell his father he'll call him back.
</li><li> By the third game, it becomes an aversion. Garrus mentions that they never saw eye-to-eye on things, so when Garrus sees him in person and says it's serious, his father listens. Garrus explained everything that's happened; Saren, Virmire, the Collectors, the Reapers, everything. His father doesn't believe at the start, but then he started connecting the dots and accepts it as the truth since Garrus wouldn't be making this stuff up for a joke.

What makes Zelda especially resentful is that she <em>has</em> been praying at the requisite fountains and doing all manner of other things to unlock this ability, all for naught.

Teyrn Bryce Cousland is actually quite open to the possibility of his younger child becoming a Grey Warden; the unusual aspect is that he's okay with it even if his younger child is female, whereas most noble fathers in the setting don't allow their daughters to pursue such things. His only objection is the current <em>timing</em> - he and his older child are about to be gone from the castle for a considerable length of time and he needs his younger child to oversee things in their absence. If they're still interested when he comes back, he says, they can talk about it then. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the plot happens.</span>

Ironically enough, his continued belief that Evan is off playing make-believe is what renders him oblivious to Evan's globetrotting adventures as the newest Dragon Master.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em>, both Souma and Kaoru's parents disapproved of them going to Yumenosaki and training as an idol, wanting them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps">Follow In Their Footsteps</a>. In Souma's case, he came out of sincere passion, and it's only after Kuro, Keito, and even Anzu visit with them multiple times that they seem to accept it. (And the broader family still very much looks down on him for it.) For Kaoru, these three years were meant to be his last of freedom before he's expected to join the family business, so he intended on just lazing around and enjoying himself before then, but eventually comes to realise he does actually like being an idol. Though they deal with a similar issue, they clash due to their totally different ways of dealing with it: Souma tries to be absolutely perfect, and a model kid in every way other than being an idol, while Kaoru leans into his image as a slacker as a way of owning and controlling it.

This skill later proves useful on a mission, where Otto sews a straight-jacket and tricks Davy Crockett into wearing it, saving him and the guys from getting attacked by Santa Ana's army.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a>'s father, George Sr., did not approve of his film-making career. He did come around when his son started breaking box office records. In fact, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Star Wars</a></em> had its public debut and brought the house down, George Sr., was right outside the theatre shaking hands with pride and his thanks to everyone who made his son's success so spectacular.
</li><li> Neither did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata">Satoru Iwata</a>'s parents approve of him joining the staff at Nintendo. He went on to run the company. Notice that Iwata was willing to speak about anything in his past in his "Iwata Asks" column—except his parents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>'s father tore up all of his comic books when he was a teenager.
</li><li> Many of the reasons for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> adopting a flamboyant image in his career (especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>) had to do with rebelling against his strict biological father (who divorced Elton's mother when he was young), who hated rock music and wanted Elton to wear conservative clothing and get a respectable job as a banker. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Elton later said</a> he took on the job writing music for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BillyElliot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BillyElliot">Billy Elliot</a></em> musical partly because he identified with Billy so much for this reason.
</li><li> Baseball great Joe DiMaggio had a fisherman father who, on top of calling his son "lazy" and "good for nothing," completely dismissed his son's passion for baseball in favor of a future of fishing.
</li><li> "The guitar's all right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John</a>, but you'll never make a living at it."
</li><li> "Writing is your worst skill. You'll be lucky if you make a <em>dime.</em>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyTan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyTan">Amy Tan</a>'s boss at her shitty job. (Her mother stood by her decision to quit said shitty job and become a full-time writer.)
</li><li> Though obviously exaggerated in the strip, several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Jerry Holkin's</a> writings, both on the site and in the print collections, make it clear his mother was against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> due to her church thinking they were full of bad magic and the like.

</li><li> Inverted, but good, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyJackson">Shirley Jackson</a>. Invited to write a children's book, she was provided with a list of acceptable vocabulary words. She saw <em>getting</em> and <em>spending</em>, <em>cost,</em> <em>buy</em>, <em>supermarket</em>, <em>post office</em> — but not <em>magic</em>, <em>wishing</em> or <em>Fairyland.</em> Incensed, she wrote <em>Nine Magic Wishes</em>. In the two books about her home life, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeAmongTheSavages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeAmongTheSavages">Life Among the Savages</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingDemons">Raising Demons</a></em>, she allows her children's imaginations free rein.
<div class="indent"> <em>... there are many groups of educators who feel that Fairyland is an unhealthy environment for growing minds, but in a choice between television ("television" was on the list) and Fairyland, I know where I would rather have my own children growing up.</em>
</div></li><li> Ernest Thompson Seton (founder of the Woodcraft Indians and founding pioneer of the Boy Scouts of America) wrote in his autobiography about how his grandfather was apparently one of these, forbidding Seton's own father from becoming an engineer for railroad construction since he felt the railroad was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWIllNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWIllNeverCatchOn">just a passing fad</a>.
</li><li> A promising young mangaka's mother really, <strong>really</strong> didn't want her fourth child to replace his attempts to get into university with his budding manga career. The son's name? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai">Go Nagai</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a></em>s parents forbid him from reading comics, thinking they were a bad influence on him, and would often throw them away when they found them in his room when he wasn't home.
</li><li> Helen Louise "Nellie" Herron wanted to take piano lessons to improve her skills, but her father wouldn't pay for them, feeling that they cost too much for what was "simply a pastime". Later, her mother disapproved of her ambition to become a teacher, and continually tried to get her to stop even after she got a successful job, feeling a career would ruin Nellie's chances of marriage. Against her mother's predictions, Nellie went on to marry a successful lawyer by the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a>'s father, Elias, just could not buy that his son wanted to be an artist for a living, seeing it as a waste of time. Even when Walt became a huge success in the entertainment world, Elias was unable — or perhaps unwilling — to understand it. In 1939, Walt took his father to visit the under-construction new studio in Burbank, but all Elias could think of was what else the buildings could be used for in the event it failed, thinking Walt would never make it in the movie industry in the long run. Walt ended up saying that he could always convert his studio into a hospital, and as he took his father around, he described the buildings as a hospital and not an animation studio, to his father's relief. As far as the utilitarian, no-nonsense Elias was concerned, a hospital was more attractive than a film studio. Indeed, a creature of the 19th century, when it was more common sense to be a doctor or a lawyer, Elias saw entertainment and consumer indulgence as frivolous and would have nothing to do with it. He died in 1941, never making peace with the new century.
