<p>AKA Screen Names.
</p><p>When someone goes into the public sphere image becomes everything, and even how you pronounce your name becomes important. You want to go by Jim, Jimmy, Jamie or James? A stage name is when someone chooses a public name that is technically not their legal or original name. The reasons vary, but the common examples are:
</p><ul><li> Their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy">isn't exciting or exotic enough</a>
</li><li> It may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">embarrassing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">difficult to read</a> or a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTwister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TongueTwister">Tongue Twister</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> Their own is "too foreign" or they want to minimize their ethnic background (while there may be some racism involved here, 5 syllables tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">catchier than 15</a> and some may not look like the ethnicity their name implies)
</li><li> Someone in the local actors' union or someone very famous outside the union <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">already has</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">that name</a>
</li><li> To distance themselves from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">a problematic past</a>, or even avoid union fines by working in a non-union production
</li><li> To keep their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">personal lives private</a>
</li><li> When women get married they may want to continue with a name known to the public even though they legally have a different name now
</li><li> They want to give themselves an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">"Awesome McCool" Name</a> (especially prevalent in the music industry, but particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a>)
</li></ul><p>Performers can go a lot of ways when choosing a new name. Some add a middle name, some add an initial somewhere, some add their mother's maiden name or the name of someone they respect, while others just choose a name at random. Carole Lombard chose her professional surname <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">from a shop sign</a>, for instance. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfHollywood">the old days</a>, a lot of actors had their professional names chosen for them by the studio they were signed to, and others were given a list of approved names to pick from.

</p><p>A common choice is one's mother's maiden name; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NomDeMom">Nom de Mom</a>.

</li><li> Susan Antonia Williams Stockard combined her last name with that of her husband at the time and became Stockard Channing.

Pollard.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenKingsley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenKingsley">Ben Kingsley</a>'s birth name is Krishna Bhanji. He changed it after it was mispronounced as 'Kristina Blange' during an audition for a high-school play.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKeaton">Diane Keaton</a>'s name is Diane Hall but she uses her mom's maiden name since there was a "Diane Hall" already registered with SAG. The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall">Annie Hall</a></em> is actually named after her since "Annie" was what she went by as a child.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen">Tim Allen</a> was born Timothy Allen Dick (no relation to Andy Dick, who was born Andrew Thomlinson). He dropped his last name mostly because he didn't think anybody would believe he didn't make it up for a cheap laugh.
</li><li> Don Adams' birth name was Donald James Yarmy. He was once married to an actress with the stage name Adelaide Adams. He became Don Adams because auditions were frequently in alphabetical order.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>'s birth name was Marion Michael Morrison, although as it turns out he was called "Duke" (which was the name of a dog) long before he became "John Wayne".
</li><li> Don Knotts' full name was Jesse Donald Knotts.
</li><li> As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ray">Ray</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles">Ray Charles</a> was born Ray Charles Robinson, but dropped his surname due to the famous boxer "Sugar" Ray Robinson (which itself was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName">Stage Name</a> of Walker Smith Jr.).
</li><li> Thomas Cruise Mapother IV dropped his last name, because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise">Tom Cruise</a>" just sounds much cooler than "Tom Mapother".
</li><li> James Scott Bumgarner dropped the first syllable of his last name to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGarner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGarner">James Garner</a>.
</li><li> Nicolas Coppola didn't want to ride on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">his director uncle's</a> fame, so he took the last name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke Cage</a> to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a>.
</li><li> Considering that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has been on for over fifty years, many of the cast members have chosen stage names for a variety of reasons.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a> is actually David MacDonald, but Equity already had someone with that name, so he named himself after Neil Tennant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavison">Peter Davison</a> is actually Peter Moffett, this name change being to avoid confusion with director Peter Moffat (who worked with him on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>). This doesn't extend to the rest of his family, as his daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgiaMoffett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgiaMoffett">Georgia Moffett</a> used her birth name up until marrying David Tennant.
</li><li> James Percy Patrick Kent-Smith took the stage name "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylveste McCoy</a>" while touring with Ken Campbell, and later added an R to the first name. According to one account, it was originally a joke <em>about</em> stage names — "Sylveste McCoy is only my stage name, of course, my real name is... Sylvest<em>er</em> McCoy" — that he decided to run with after a theatre critic failed to get it and thought Sylvester McCoy actually was his real name.
</li><li> Jon Pertwee's real name is Jean Roland Devon de Perthuis (he's of French and Austrian descent). People in his family use Pertwee as a phonetic spelling. He also went by the anglicised John, before a playbill misspelt his name.
</li><li> It extends to companions too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LallaWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LallaWard">Lalla Ward</a>'s real first name is Sarah.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper">Billie Piper</a>'s real name is Leian Piper, but chose the stage name "Billie" for her music career. When she switched to acting she then changed it again to Billie Piper.
</li></ul></li><li> Film actor Stewart Granger's real name was James Stewart, and in fact changed it before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyStewart">Jimmy Stewart</a> came into Hollywood.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a>s name is Neta-Lee Hershlag. Portman is her paternal grandmothers maiden name. Since she got her start as a child, her parents wanted to keep her real name private for her sake as well as for the sake of her Israeli fathers medical practice / academic work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNovak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNovak">Kim Novak</a>'s first name is actually Marilyn, but was changed when she signed her contract with Columbia to avoid confusion with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. Of course, "Marilyn Monroe" was itself a stage name, her real name being Norma Jeane Mortenson.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note192uy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note192uy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note192uy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She was born a Mortenson because her mother, born Gladys <em>Monroe</em>, was separated from her husband, one Martin Mortenson, at the time of her birth. The future Marilyn Monroe more often used the surname "Baker", from Gladys' first husband.</span>Many bombshells and sex symbols of old-time Hollywood have real names that are depressingly prosaic in comparison to their better-known stage names.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>'s real name is Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland (she's the sister of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaDeHavilland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaDeHavilland">Olivia de Havilland</a>). Fontaine had been their mother's stage name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyMacLaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyMacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a> was originally Shirley MacLean Beaty. Her brother simply added a second "t" to their last name, becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenBeatty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenBeatty">Warren Beatty</a>.
</li><li> Catherine Dorleac chose her mother's maiden name Deneuve as her stage surname, to differentiate herself fron her (initially) more famous sister Françoise.
</li><li> Colette Dacheville became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephaneAudran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephaneAudran">Stéphane Audran</a>, while Marie-France Ogier dropped her first name after becoming generally known by the nickname "Bulle" ("Bubble").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CydCharisse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CydCharisse">Cyd Charisse</a> was born Tula Ellice Finklea. "Sid" was a childhood nickname. Nico Charisse was her first husband.
</li><li> Yvonne De Carlo's real name is Margaret Yvonne "Peggy" Middleton. (In her pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em> career, De Carlo generally played exotic-beauty roles; "Peggy Middleton" just wouldn't have cut it for an actress playing such roles. See remarks on Cyd Charisse above.) Her mother's name was Marie De Carlo.
</li><li> Claudette Colbert was born as Émilie Chauchoin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a>'s real name was Frances Ethel Gumm. It's hard to blame her for not using her birth name.
</li><li> Ginger Rogers' real name was Virginia Katherine McMath. Ginger is a standard nickname for Virginia; Rogers was her stepfather.
</li><li> Diana Dors' real name was the unfortunate Diana Fluck. As she said: "They asked me to change my name. I suppose they were afraid that if my real name Diana Fluck was in lights and one of the lights blew..."
</li><li> Triple or quadruple the "wouldn't cut it" comment for Archibald Leach, who went on to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant">Cary Grant</a> in the movies. (Interviewer: "Everybody would like to be Cary Grant." Cary Grant: "So would I.")
</li><li> Italian TV and film actors <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerenceHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerenceHill">Terence Hill</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BudSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BudSpencer">Bud Spencer</a> were born Mario Girotti and Carlo Pedersoli.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Western</a> actor Giuliano Gemma is credited in some movies with anglophone name "Montgomery Wood".
</li><li> Italian actor and screenwriter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeEastman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeEastman">George Eastman</a> was born Luigi Montefiori.

</li><li> Actress Sydney Tamiia Poitier also uses her middle name so as not to confuse her with her father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneyPoitier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneyPoitier">Sidney Poitier</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel">Idina Menzel</a>'s last name is really "Mentzel". She eventually dropped the 't' to better reflect the pronounciation it gained in America.
</li><li> A famous fake real name story: Walter Matthau was once famously credited for a cameo under the alias "Walter Matuschanskayasky"; fan folklore then turned this pseudonym into his supposed real name, which he allegedly changed to sound less ethnic. In reality, his <em>real</em> real name was Walter Matthow, which he changed to Matthau because it was the usual American spelling. He only used Matuschanskayasky as a stage name once, in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Earthquake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Earthquake">Earthquake</a></em>, when he agreed to play a cameo role only if his real name wasn't used.

</li><li> Samuel Horwitz = Shemp Howard (though this was due to a speech impediment on his Lithuanian-born mother's part, where "Sam" came out "Shemp").

His son, Carlos, chose to follow in his footsteps and became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a></em> (although this is only his stage name; when some court documents related to one of his myriad arrests were leaked, they showed his legal name is still Carlos Estevez), some of the family (his brother, and some sons) switch between, while his daughter and one son kept their original names - most notably <em>Emilio Estevez</em>.
</li><li> The story goes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s first US agent told him he'd never be successful in Hollywood for three reasons: he was too muscular, his accent was too thick and no one could pronounce his name. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HerculesInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HerculesInNewYork">Hercules in New York</a></em> was his first US movie (as Arnold Strong - a pun on both his physique and co-star Arnold Stang - with his voice redubbed.)

</li><li> Phoebe Cates's original name is Phoebe Belle Katz. (This is likely a phonetic spelling, since "Katz" is sometimes pronounced "Cates".)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorisDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorisDay">Doris Day</a>'s real name is Doris Mary Anne von Kappelhoff.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBronson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBronson">Charles Bronson</a> was born Charles Buchinsky, which was the Latinized version of either Karolis Bučinskis, Casimir Businskis, or Karol Buczyński. He changed the name on the suggestion of his agent, who was concerned that someone with an Eastern European last name would wind up getting in trouble due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy">McCarthy</a> hearings going down in the 50s.
</li><li> Margarita Carmen Cansino underwent extensive follicle removal to become the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RitaHayworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RitaHayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. Hayworth was her mother's maiden name, though.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvonneStrahovski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvonneStrahovski">Yvonne Strahovski</a>'s actual last name is Strzechowski. Josh Schwartz asked her to change it to a phonetic spelling so people would actually know how to pronounce it.
</li><li> Izabella Miko's actual last name is Mikołajczak. Most probably it was too long to pronounce.
</li><li> Mia Sara, whose actual last name is Sarapocciello.
</li><li> Barbara Bain was originally named Millicent Fogel.
</li><li> <em>Meet Millie</em> writer Francis Allen Goldstucker changed his name to Frank Galen.
</li><li> David S. Cohen was credited as David X. Cohen in the opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> because the WGA already had a completely different David S. Cohen on the books. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">He chose X because it sounded "sci-fi-ish".</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronJohnson">Aaron (Perry) Johnson</a> and Samantha Taylor-Wood, after working in <em>Nowhere Boy</em>, became a couple and decided to share a surname. Now they're Aaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson.
</li><li> Reportedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonVoight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonVoight">Jon Voight</a> gave his children middle names that could act as last names, so they wouldn't be hooked to their famous father. James Haven isn't that well-known, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a> certainly has made a name for herself. Jon Voight's brother, James Voight, is better known as the musician Chip Taylor, who wrote the song "Wild Thing", performed by the Troggs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardEGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardEGrant">Richard E.

</li><li> Edward G. Robinson, formerly Emanuel Goldenberg.
</li><li> Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz dropped his last name because of issues with his father. Now he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart">Jon Stewart</a>.

He needed a stage name because <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas">Michael Douglas</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStreetsOfSanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStreetsOfSanFrancisco">The Streets of San Francisco</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatalAttraction">Fatal Attraction</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet">Wall Street</a></em>, etc.) had established a prior claim, and he may have been influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton">Buster Keaton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeKeaton">Diane Keaton</a>. As it turns out, Buster Keaton's real first name was Joseph, while Diane Keaton was born Diane Hall and <em>also</em> had to change her name because it was already being used (Keaton was her mother's maiden name).
</li><li> Michael Douglas' father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, was born as Issur Danielovitch, and went by Izzy Demsky growing up. He legally became Kirk Douglas before enlisting in the Navy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> was often credited under assumed names (if he's credited at all) when he did a cameo: "Ray D.

George Spelvin, in fact, was rather long-running one. According to <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Playbill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Playbill">Playbill</a></em>, back in the early 1900s people were unaccustomed to actors playing more than one part, and so Spelvin was credited with roles taken by an actor credited for a different one already. He became a long-running tradition but was eventually dropped in the late 1980s when audiences became more okay with the idea.
</li><li> Albert L. Einstein changed his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertBrooks">Albert Brooks</a> when he started performing comedy to distinguish himself from <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a>. The inspiration for the surname is homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks">Mel Brooks</a>. His now-deceased brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobEinstein">Bob Einstein</a> performed as "Super Dave Osborne" for less obvious reasons, though he would go on to play significant recurring roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>, credited under his real name.
</li><li> Another "the name was taken": when Joseph Lane went to register for Actors Equity, he discovered there was already a member by that name. So he took the first name of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls">Guys and Dolls</a></em> character Nathan Detroit, becoming Nathan Lane. (Appropriately enough, it was a turn as Nathan Detroit in a Broadway revival of the show that proved to be his star-making role.)
</li><li> A female case of name taken is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBanks">Elizabeth Banks</a>, given she couldn't go with birth name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethMitchell">Elizabeth Mitchell</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilyJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilyJames">Lily James</a> also made a surname out of her father's name after finding out about an already existing Lily Thomson.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel">Vin Diesel</a> was born Mark Sinclair. Vincent is his stepfathers name and he picked up the 'diesel' part from his friends, due his 'non-stop energy'. Ironic, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">what movie he's famous for</a>.
</li><li> Jerome Silberman changed his name while studying acting in New York as he felt it would look/sound odd on a marquee if he played Macbeth. He created a new name from his mother's first (Jean) and playwright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThorntonWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThorntonWilder">Thornton Wilder</a>'s last. Though he did serious roles early in his stage career, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder">Gene Wilder</a> became famous for film comedies.
</li><li> Richard Henry Sellers was the second child born to his parents. The first died very, very young, and his name - Peter - became a nickname for the second, used so often that Richard Henry ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">changed his name permanently.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>'s birth name was Caryn Elaine Johnson. Not exactly an attention-grabber. Reportedly, she was originally going to call herself "Whoopi Coushin", after the gag gift, but her parents convinced her that - even as a comedian - the name would prevent anyone from taking her seriously. Also, her mother told her that her name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews">"wasn't Jewish enough"</a> to make her a star.
</li><li> Sir Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr. is better known as Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine">Michael Caine</a>. Originally, he wanted his stage name to be Michael Scott, but that was taken. Pressed for a new one, he looked at a nearby cinema billboard and saw <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaineMutiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaineMutiny">The Caine Mutiny</a></em>. And the rest, as they say, is history. He jokes that if he had looked the other way, he would be Sir Michael One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
</li><li> Theda Bara, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">vamp</a>, was born Theodosia Goodman. Her screen name combined a childhood nickname and a variation on a family surname — and, conveniently enough, was an anagram for "Arab death."
</li><li> William Henry Pratt took the stage name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff">Boris Karloff</a>, possibly because he felt his surname had unwanted humorous connotations. He never legally changed his name, however.
</li><li> Greg Pead changed his name in 1980 to Yahoo Serious (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungEinstein">Young Einstein</a></em> fame).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderSiddig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderSiddig">Alexander Siddig</a> (Dr. Julian Bashir from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and Doran Martel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>) was originally credited under his real name - Siddig El Fadil, which itself is just an abbreviation of his full real name, for obvious reasons: Siddig El Tahir El Fadil El Siddig Abderrahman Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Karim El Mahdi. He still used Siddig El Fadil as a directing credit for one episode of DS9 after the name change.
</li><li> John Garman Hertzler, a recurring actor on DS9 best known as the Klingon general Martok, typically went by his intials J.G. (taking a cue from J.T. Walsh), but when he played the Vulcan captain of the <em>Saratoga</em> in "Emissary", he was credited as "John <em>Noah</em> Hertzler" (as he hadn't established himself yet), and for his role as the changeling Laas in "Chimera", he was credited under his middle name as "Garman Hertzler".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a> is really Chan Kong Sang. He picked up the nickname Jackie working in Australia as a teenager and had an older friend named Jack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JetLi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JetLi">Jet Li</a> is really Li Lianjie.
</li><li> Ever hear of Saedo Maeda? That's Sonny Chiba's real name.
</li><li> Like Noriyuki "Pat" Morita.
</li><li> Kal Penn's real name is Kalpen Modi. Obviously, he just took his first name and divided it in two (and added an extra N). The late Italian actress Pier Angeli did something similar, only with her surname (Pierangeli).
</li><li> Heather Renée Sweet became Dita Von Teese.
</li><li> Jonathan Michael Francis O'Keefe changed his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRhysMeyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRhysMeyers">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson">Brie Larson</a>'s real last name is Desaulniers but uses a stage name as it's hard to pronounce. She picked "Larson" because it was the name of her favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a> character that just happened to be one of her great grandmother's maiden name.
</li><li> Laszlo Loewenstein - "Lazzy" to his friends - was a struggling stage actor in Vienna when his mentor suggested he use a catchy new name. Combining a friend's name with the German word for parrot, the actor was redubbed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre">Peter Lorre</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow">Jean Harlow</a>'s original name was Harlean Carpanter, a combination of the last and first name of her mother, Jean Harlow. When Harlean went into acting, she adopted her mother's name.
</li><li> Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto d'Abruzzo took the first two letters of his first and last names as his surname and an Anglicised version of one of his middle names to come up with the name Robert Alda. When his sons (by different wives) Alphonso and Antonio followed their father into acting, they took his stage surname and Anglicised their first names (approximately in Alphonso's case) to create the names <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda">Alan Alda</a> and Antony Alda.
</li><li> Japanese actress/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic">J-pop singer</a> Meisa Kuroki's real name is Satsuki Shimabukuro.
</li><li> Armenian pop star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sirusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sirusho">Sirusho</a>'s real name is Siranush Harutyunyan.
</li><li> If the Playbills for the premiere performance for the play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly">M. Butterfly</a></em> had listed one of its stars' names as "Brad Wong", it would have spoiled the show's big twist — so he became "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BDWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BDWong">B.D. Wong</a>".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a> (who were actually brothers, surnamed Marx): Groucho (Julius Henry), Harpo (Adolph, changed to Arthur in 1911, before Hitler), Chico (Leonard), Zeppo (Herbert Manfred) and Gummo (Milton). Their stage names were coined for them by stand-up comedian Art Fisher during a poker game, and only adopted full-time when their act was well established. In an aversion of the ethnicity camouflage motivation, while the family <em>was</em> Jewish, their real names were passably not. (However, Chico did develop his trademark accent in order to divert antisemitic bullies.)
</li><li> Rose Louise Hovick was a vaudeville performer, movie actress, and novelist. She's better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy">Gypsy Rose Lee</a>. Her sister appeared in Broadway shows under the name June Havoc.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayneMansfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayneMansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a> kept using her first husband's surname professionally, even after divorcing and remarrying. Additionally, Jayne was her middle name: her first name was Vera.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeMack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeeMack">Lee Mack</a> (real name Lee Gordon McKillop) takes his stage name from his great-grandfather, vaudeville performer Big Billy Mack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaWilde">Olivia Wilde</a>'s original surname was the rather unfortunate "Cockburn" (pronounced "co-burn", but we can't really blame her for not wanting to spend her whole life correcting people on that). She took her stage name from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a>.
</li><li> Born to vaudevillian parents, 7-year-old Joseph Yule Jr. landed a role as Mickey McGuire in a series of film shorts, and became identified with that name, even legally adopting it for a short period during legal wrangles over the series. Prohibited from using the name when touring as a comedy act, he chose a similar one, modifying his mothers suggestion of "Mickey Looney", and becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney">Mickey Rooney</a>.
</li><li> Harris Glenn Milstead was better known as the outrageous drag diva Divine.
</li><li> Laurence Tureauds birth name didnt really suit a tough guy, so he became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT">Mr. T</a>.
<ul><li> Another story has it that he changed his name to "Mr. T" after having gotten fed up with people continually call his older brother, a Vietnam veteran, "boy". According to this account, he changed his name so that people would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCallMeMisterTibbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCallMeMisterTibbs">forced to call him "mister"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrianPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrianPaul">Adrian Paul</a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> fame was born Adrian Paul Hewitt. He takes advantage of using his real last name when traveling, to keep a lower profile.
</li><li> Anthony Head had to alter his name when he began working in the USA, due to someone else already being registered with his name. That's why in the US he's billed as Anthony Stewart Head, but often just Anthony Head in the UK.
</li><li> Nicholas Brendan dropped his last name, as did his brother, to avoid confusion.
</li><li> Played with, and ultimately averted with James Roday Rodriguez of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> fame. He was born James David Rodriguez to a Latino father and a white mother, and could easily pass for white. Since there was already someone with the name "James Rodriguez" in the Screen Actors' Guild, he had to either use a middle initial (which he wasn't too thrilled about) or choose a different last name. Apparently, when he got his first job out of college, a TV exec suggested he change his name so they wouldn't get flack for trying to pass off a white guy as Latino for diversity reasons, hence the more Anglo-sounding "James Roday", named after a character in <em>The Three Sisters.</em> In July 2020, James announced that he would go by his full name, "James Roday Rodriguez" (he legally changed his middle name to "Roday" years earlier) going forward to reflect his pride in his Mexican heritage, with <em>Psych 2: Lassie Come Home</em> being the first project to credit him as such.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeanMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeanMartin">Dean Martin</a> was born Dino Paul Crocetti. He used the stage name Dino Martini (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Italian tenor Nino Martini) when he began performing as a singer in local bands, and then anglicized it.
</li><li> Back when he was starting out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves">Keanu Reeves</a> used the name Casey Reeves for auditions. He eventually started using his given name and the rest is history.
</li><li> Stan Jefferson was told by his wife that his name was unlucky because it contained thirteen letters. Searching for something that would symbolise success, he hit upon the Roman emblem of victory, changed his last name to 'Laurel', and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">became immortal</a>.
</li><li> Well-upholstered comedian Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle disliked being referred to and billed under his lifelong nickname "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FattyArbuckle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FattyArbuckle">Fatty</a>", but accepted it as inevitable. In a straighter example, when he was barred from acting following legal accusations, he directed a number of comedies under the name William Goodrich.
</li><li> When Jason Geiger came to a talent agency in California, they thought his name wasn't strong enough for an actor and created with him another inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan">Steve Austin</a>: Austin St. John. And the rationale became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> given the breakout role St. John got was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Red Ranger</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Jason Lee Scott</a>.
</li><li> Randolph Severn Parker III is better known to audiences as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker</a>, with "Trey" based off a nickname from being the third Randolph in line in his family. He also used the alias "Juan Schwartz" for <em>Cannibal! The Musical</em>, and for his work in the unaired pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> (an extended version of "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe").
</li><li> Anne-Sophie Lennerfors, an actress in Japan known for her mixed heritage (Japanese-Swedish), is usually simply credited as "LiLiCo" or "LILIKO" for her film and voice acting work. In the case you don't know her significance as far as her acting goes, she was most prominently known as the (first) Japanese dub voice of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">Eric Cartman</a></strong>.
</li><li> One of the child actresses who played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em> in the 1930s, Dawn Evelyeen Paris, adopted her character's name (Anne Shirley) as her stage moniker; previously she was billed as "Dawn O'Day".
</li><li> Christian Camargo, better known as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ice Truck Killer</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>, was born Christian Minnick, but he changed his surname to his maternal grandfather's out of pride in his Mexican-American heritage. Ironically, his grandfatherRalph (born Rafael) Camargo, who was also an actorurged his daughters to change their last name to something more Anglicized to avoid being locked out of roles in the acting world because of their heritage.
</li><li> Christian's mother is former soap actress Victoria Wyndham, originally Victoria Camargo. You'd never guess she was Mexican, and apparently, the same goes for her son.
</li><li> David Harvard Lawrence wanted to make himself stand out from the other David Lawrences in the SAG database. Seeing he was the seventeenth guy with that name on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> (who differentiates people with Roman algarisms), he became David H. Lawrence XVII.
</li><li> Tony Malanowski, director of the infamous <em>Night of Horror</em> (and its remake <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/The_Curse_of_the_Screaming_Dead_1982.aspx">Curse of the Cannibal Confederates<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>), is billed among the cast and writers of that movie as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> ("<a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Night_of_Horror_1981.aspx">I believe he came up with this "original story idea" during the same six-month bender back in the 80's that found him wandering around town in an alcoholic haze and a dirty tuxedo."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> Kevin Tighe was born Kevin Fishburne. One has to wonder if he would have still been advised today to change or not, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne">Laurence Fishburne</a> made it big with the same last name.
</li><li> Randolph Mantooth had a bit of a misunderstanding in his case. He was advised to pick a new last name for the stage, and thought they meant first name. He was born Randy Mantooth and opted to become Randolph onscreen.
</li><li> Roy Rogers and Dale Evans both did this. Rogers was born Leonard Slye, and Evans was born Francis Octavia Smith.
</li><li> Eugene Rubessa was best known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> host Gene Rayburn.
</li><li> Steven Hill, best known for his roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em>, was born Solomon Krakovsky. After retiring he went by the name Shlomo Hill (Shlomo being the Hebrew equivalent of Solomon).
</li><li> The LaCock show business family, originally from West Virginia, achieved no fame under that name. However, two of its members did eventually achieve major success. Joan Letitia became noted actress Joanne Dru, and Ralph Pierre went on to even greater fame as "the master of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em>", Peter Marshall.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2nsul');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2nsul" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2nsul');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Peter, however, legally remains a LaCock to this day; he had a son who played in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> for nearly a decade under the name Pete LaCock.</span>
</li><li> Actress <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeBennett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeBennett">Chloe Bennett</a> was born Chloe Wang and chose an Anglo-Saxon surname when it became apparent that Hollywood has a problem with Asians.
</li><li> Actress/screenwriter Michaela Coel was born Michaela-Moses Ewuraba O Boakye-Collinson.
</li><li> Bobby Calloway's legal name is Rory Leonard but he had been nicknamed Bobby since he was a teenager. He picked 'Calloway' as a last name when he became a wrestler, and kept the stage name when he went into acting. Also counts as a pen name, as he wrote for <em>Lethal WOW</em> under the same name too.
</li><li> Canadian-American actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CreeSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CreeSummer">Cree Summer</a> is actually Cree Summer Francks. Her father is the late American actor <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonFrancks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonFrancks">Don Francks</a>.
</li><li> Bex Taylor-Klaus' real name is Rebecca Edison Taylor-Klaus. She shortened her first name to just Bex to sound it a bit more tomboyish, given the fact that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling">best</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">known</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamTVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamTVSeries">for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfLies">playing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">tomboyish characters</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenYeun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenYeun">Steven Yeun</a>'s real name is Yeun Sang-yeop, given that he was born in South Korea before his family moved to America when he was a child and his parents changed his first name to Steven after they met a doctor by that name.
</li><li> A subtle example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineZetaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineZetaJones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> was born Catherine Zeta Jones, with no hyphen  "Zeta" was her middle name and "Jones" her surname.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaStone">Emma Stone</a> was born Emily Jean Stone. There was already an Emily Stone in the union and Emma had been a nickname for her anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep">Meryl Streep</a>'s first name is actually Mary Louise, and it was a family tradition to name the daughters 'Mary something'. Meryl was a nickname for her as a child that she initially hated. She also joked that she would have loved to change 'Streep' to 'Street'. Her first daughter followed tradition, named Mary Willa but chose the stage name Mamie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleCry1955" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleCry1955">Battle Cry (1955)</a></em> featured actor Justus McQueen in his film debut as Pvt. L.Q. Jones. As it turned out, McQueen liked the character's name, and adopted L.Q. Jones as his stage name from there on out.
</li><li> When she was starting out as an actress, Alison Schermerhorn got tired of having to explain how her last name was pronounced, so she dropped it and used her middle name in its place. That's why she's currently known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlisonBrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlisonBrie">Alison Brie</a>.
</li><li> Arlene Francis, an actress best known as a game show panelist, most notably on <em>What's My Line?</em>, dropped her family name and tweaked the spelling of her first name. She was born <em>Arline</em> Francis Kazanjian.
</li><li> When starting out as a singer in the late 1940s, Delloreese Patricia Early decided to convert her first name into a stage nameDella Reese. She would go on to significant success in music and even greater success as an actress, most notably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em>.
</li><li> Vaudeville violinist Benjamin Kubelsky changed his name to Ben K. Bennie to avoid confusion with violinist Jan Kubelik. One decade later, Bennie, now a monologist, had to change his name again because Ben Bernie had a similar "patter-and-violin" routine. And thus, the name Jack Benny came into being.
</li><li> Sadye Marks, Benny's wife both onstage and in real life, became known professionally as Mary Livingstone.
</li><li> George Burns' birth name was Nathaniel Birnbaum.
</li><li> John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName">Florence</a> Sullivan became known as Fred Allen.
</li><li> Actor Timothy Carlton Congdon Cumberbatch simply used the first half of his name professionally. His son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict</a> decided not to go his father's route, and kept his birth surname.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinJames">Kevin James</a>' name at birth was Kevin George Knipfing, and chose the last name "James" as a homage to his favorite teacher. His brother Gary Knipfing adopted his father's middle name as his surname and became Gary Valentine.
</li><li> Sofia Villani Scicolone (roughly pronounced <em>She-ko-lo-nay</em>) first went by "Sofia Lazzaro" before settling for the foreign-sounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SophiaLoren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SophiaLoren">Sophia Loren</a>, reportedly inspired by Swedish actress Märta Torén.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieFoxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieFoxx">Jamie Foxx</a> was born Eric Bishop. During he start in stand-up comedy clubs he found out female comedians were often chosen first to perform, hence the gender-neutral name Jamie. "Foxx" was after comedian Redd Foxx.
</li><li> Redd Foxx was also a stage name for John Elroy Sanford. His iconic role as Fred G. Sanford in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em> was named and modeled after his real-life brother.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PedroPascal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PedroPascal">Pedro Pascal</a>'s full name is José Pedro Balmaceda Pascal. He shortened it to Pedro Balmaceda for his earliest gigs, but discrimination against light-skinned Latino actors prompted him to rechristen himself Alexander Pascal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3y9iw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3y9iw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3y9iw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the first name borrowed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FannyAndAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FannyAndAlexander">Fanny and Alexander</a></em>; the surname borrowed from Pascal's late mother, whose maiden name proved easier for non-Latinos to pronounce than "Balmaceda" did</span>. After a year, guilt over such a drastic rename prompted "Alex" to compromise with the alias Pedro Pascal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaimieAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaimieAlexander">Jaimie Alexander</a>'s surname is actually Tarbush.
</li><li> Portuguese-German comedian Hermann Joseph von Krippahl dropped the second N from his first name and romanised his middle name to its Portuguese variation, hence becoming Herman José.

<ul><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Pro Wrestlers</a> operate under a stage name. Some are easy to pick out, while others are subtle.
<ul><li> An aversion when you consider the few who go by their real names, oftentimes second- or third-generation stars like brothers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>, and father-and-son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobOrtonJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobOrtonJr">"Cowboy" Bob</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. Another second-generation star, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MrPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MrPerfect">Curt Hennig</a>, was commonly known by his real name even if he mostly wrestled as Mr. Perfect.
</li></ul></li><li> Brian Pillman Jr. isn't a 100% aversion. While he uses his real name, the "Jr." part is kayfabed<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman">his late father</a> was Brian William, while he's Brian Zachary.
<dl><dd><ul><li> Wrestlers who were stars in other sports often use their real names in pro wrestling, such as MMA fighters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern">Dan Severn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>, Olympic powerlifter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a>, and Olympic wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> did a rather fun storyline on this, with <em>Tough Enough</em> season 3 winner John Hennigan being completely unable to decide on a stage name, and thus changing his name each and every week. He went through Johnny Blaze, Johnny Spade, Johnny Onyx, and Johnny Superstar before finally settling on Johnny Nitro — which was intended to be a kiss-ass maneuver towards Eric Bischoff, the former architect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> Monday Nitro</em> and then-current general manager of the Raw brand. Now, in his new gimmick as the second coming of Jim Morrison (lead singer of the Doors, whom Hennigan looks remarkably like), he's taken the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> was born Terrence Eugene Bollea. (What, not intimidating enough...?)
<ul><li> He started out wrestling as Terry Boulder, then added "Hulk" as a nickname to that, before dropping the first name and changing the last name to Hogan.
</li><li> The name "Hulk Hogan" was suggested by Vince McMahon Sr., and Hogan went along, despite feeling that the idea of an orange-skinned blonde-haired Irishman was kind of silly (Vince Sr. wanted him to dye his hair red, but Hogan was already going bald and felt the dye would make his hair fall out even faster). He got way more over under the new name than anybody expected, but there was a slight hitch — Vince's penchant for billing him as "The Incredible" Hulk Hogan caught the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, and they sued and won, taking the trademark for the name until Hogan bought it back more than two decades later.
</li><li> He started out under a mask as Super Destroyer. Also went by Sterling Golden before Hulk.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> was born Steve Anderson and later known as Steve Williams, but changed it to differentiate himself from already-established wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrDeathSteveWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrDeathSteveWilliams">"Dr. Death" Steve Williams</a>. He would later legally adopt Steve Austin (without the "Stone Cold" part).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> was born Michael Shawn Hickenbottom, a name which just doesn't fit a man who was billed as the "Sexiest Man Alive".
<ul><li> Referenced on a 2009 <em>Raw</em>, when Michaels worked as a chef and tried to avoid recognition by using the "fake name" Hickenbottom.
</li></ul></li><li> As he transitioned the wrestling world to Hollywood, The Rock gradually dropped his stage name, going from "The Rock" to "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson", and is now making films under his given name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne Johnson</a>. "The Rock" is trademarked by the WWE, so he had to stop using it when he stopped wrestling. Or when they felt like saying "no".
<ul><li> Of course, Johnson's original ring name, "Rocky Maivia", was taken from his father Rocky Johnson and his maternal grandfather Peter Maivia. Rocky Johnson was born Wayde Douglas Bowles but legally changed his name to his ring moniker in 1964.
</li></ul></li><li> Legendary nutcase <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUltimateWarrior">The Ultimate Warrior</a> legally changed his name to "Warrior" ("Ultimate Warrior" is trademarked by the WWE). His birth name? <em>Jim Hellwig</em>.
</li><li> Ditto for another wrestler who famously spiraled out of control, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> (born Joanie Marie Laurer). Until WWE's trademark on the name expired she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">got around it</a> by being billed as 'Chynna Doll'.
</li><li> Ask a non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Smark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Smark">smark</a> if they've ever heard of James Janos. More likely than not you'll get a "huh?" or somesuch in reply. Until you mention that he's more famous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura">Jesse Ventura</a>, a name he adopted to shield his family from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">nutcase fans</a>.
</li><li> Brian Lawler went by Brian Christopher when he entered wrestling, to distance himself from his famous father, Memphis wrestling legend and current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> commentator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry "The King" Lawler</a>. It didn't work very well for a number of reasons (not the least of which is an extremely strong family resemblance), and Brian Christopher's lineage soon became the single worst-kept secret in wrestling history (and keep in mind, this is the "sport" that spent the better part of a century badly hiding the fact that it was all a show).
</li><li> Virgil Riley Runnels? Not a wrestling name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a>? Better.
<ul><li> His sons have continued the tradition. Dustin Runnels, better known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Goldust</a>", wrestled as "Dustin Rhodes" in the early part of his career, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Runnels</a> also uses the "Rhodes" surname. In fact, Cody hasn't legally been "Cody Runnels" since his late teenshe's Cody Runnels Rhodes.
</li><li> It's actually quite common for second-generation wrestlers to use their fathers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> surname, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily">Von Erich Family</a>, whose real last name was Adkisson.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> was born Randy Poffo. Funny enough, his brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LannyPoffo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LannyPoffo">Lanny</a> also went into wrestling but kept the Poffo surname.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> was born Patricia Anne Stratigeas and adopted 'Stratus' when she became a model. She did, however, keep the name intact when she became a wrestler - probably because she had something of a pre-existing fanbase with it.
</li><li> Inverted by a girl who used the ring name Alexis Laree in TNA and on the independent circuit. When she was signed to WWE, she competed under her real name - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a>. Thus making her one of the few WWE female performers to become a star using her real name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a> has always competed under her first name but has rotated through differing surnames. In fact, her first ring name was just Becky. She achieved fame on the indies as Rebecca Knox but changed to Lynch when she was signed to WWE. She also considered Daly for wordplay potential.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss">Alexa Bliss</a> was renamed from Lexi Kauffman. According to her, the runner-up name was Lexie Kaye but she opted for Alexa Bliss because the former was too similar to her real name.

<ul><li> Anime example: The original North American dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoRyoOhki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoRyoOhki">Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki</a></em> were all done outside union agreements, every cast member uses an assumed name aside from Jay Hopper, who used his real name for playing Katsuhito and Nobuyuki Masaki. These are very specific to the show and sometimes in-jokes as well, such as Debi Derryberry's use of "Marie Cabbit" for her work voicing the hybrid cat-rabbit critter Ryo-Ohki.
<ul><li> This is a fairly common practice in voiceover acting. The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> all appeared under their standard pseudonyms because of uncertainty over the union situation. Of the main cast, only Doug Stone and (production staff member) Scott Dolph used their real names from the outset, while David Hayter was able to get the all-clear from the union between the printing of the game's manual and production of the disks. Later games ditched the pseudonyms completely.
<ul><li> Stage name adopted by David Hayter for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> dub, "Sean Barker", comes from the character he played in the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> movie.
</li><li> Cam Clarke's alias, "Jimmy Flinders", was taken from the name of a character he played in the '70s Mormon musical "Saturday's Warrior". He had also used the name for his work in Robotech, as well as other '80s dubs of anime.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A few other voice actors with multiple stage names:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum">Steve Blum</a> (who has performed under the names Daniel Andrews, Roger Canfield, Richard Cardona, Steven Jay, David Lucas, and Andrew Watto)

In the case of Dan Green, his real name actually is James "Jay" Snyder, but he often prefers to use the more familiar stage name of Green in dubbing.
</li><li> Barbara Goodson (Betty Gustafson, Barbara Larsen, Bertha Greene, and Shirley Roberts)
</li><li> Brianne Siddall (Jetta E. Bumpy, Brianne Brozey, Ian Hawk, Noah Fergie, and Murray Blue)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleRuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleRuff">Michelle Ruff</a> used her mother's name "Georgette Rose" in a lot of her early work.
<ul><li> This is a common practice for SAG members because most voice work is actually non-SAG... but they still want paychecks.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It's more-or-less standard in the dubs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a> anime for <em>everyone</em> to use an assumed name — usually the funniest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filth">porn-actor names</a> that the voice actors can think of.
<ul><li> The ghost of the school librarian in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostHunter">Ghost Hunter</a> is voiced by an <em>actual</em> pornstar using a pseudonym.
</li><li> In the dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuniPuniPoemi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuniPuniPoemi">Puni Puni Poemi</a></em>, one of the Aasu sisters (Mutsumi) was voiced by an unknown voice actress under the pseudonym, "Yu Haul", a pun on U-Haul and related to the character's enormous bosom.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders">Sonic Riders</a>: Zero Gravity</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>, Sonic the Hedgehog's voice actor, Jason Adam Griffith, used "Adam Caroleson", even though his real name is used in every other game. The dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> also credit him as "J. Griff".
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a>' video game <em>Starship Titanic</em>, John Cleese voiced the "Mega Scuttler" (a bomb) under the name "Kim Bread". The role mostly consisted of counting down from 1000 to zero. As a meta addendum, John's family name was actually "Cheese" - his father changed it when he joined the army, 25 years before John was born.
</li><li> Voice actor Jan Rabson used the name Stanley Gurd Jr. when dubbing for anime, ironically these are pretty much the only times he plays major characters aside from Leisure Suit Larry, most notably he voiced Tetsuo in the original dub of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a> and Han and others in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a> under this name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> had a few cases of actors that initially used aliases:
<ul><li> Erica Schroeder was usually credited as "Bella Hudson" (along with her work in other 4kids dubs), although her later roles were credited under her birth name.
</li><li> Roxanne Beck originally went by "Annie Pondel"/"Annie Pandel" for the first two seasons.
</li><li> Jay Goede voiced Mewtwo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">original movie</a> but is credited as Philip Bartlett.
</li></ul></li><li> Mary Kay Bergman used the stage name "Shannen Cassidy" for the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, as well as part of the second season<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47oke');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47oke" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47oke');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to her own interviews, the alias was derived from the names of Shannen Doherty and David Cassidy</span>. This was due to the fact that she was Disneyland's official voice of Snow White at the time, and had worried about her name being associated with adult animation. She dropped the alias around the time of the episode "Clubhouses".
<ul><li> Eliza Schneider was credited as "Blue Girl" in a few season 4 episodes, with it being an alias that she used as a performance artist.
</li><li> April Stewart initially used the name "Gracie Lazar" in order to work on the show, due to the fact that it was a non-union project (a union and salary dispute had previously lead to Eliza Schneider quitting). She dropped the alias around season 9.
</li><li> Jessica Makinson was sometimes credited under her actual name, although more current seasons have credited her under "Jessie Thomas"/"Jessie Jo Thomas".
</li><li> Elisa Gabrielli has gone under the alias "Elise Gabriel" for her occasional guest spots in the show.
</li><li> An actress with the pseudonym "Laylo Incognegro" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5haae');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5haae" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5haae');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A pun on "lay low" and "incognito"+"negro" for the role she played</span> was credited for the role of Nichole in the episode "Cartman Finds Love". It is unknown who actually provided the voice, although the usage of the alias may have been due to the show being a non-union project, or done for the sake of a gag.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenOShaughnessey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenOShaughnessey">Colleen O'Shaughnessey</a> was credited under her actual name for her work in the <em>Stick of Truth</em> video game but has been credited under the alias "Millie Oliver" for her work in season 18. She is also known as Colleen Villard, her married name.
</li></ul></li><li> Cheryl Chase used the alias "Carole Wilder" for her work on some non-union dubs of anime in the late '80s (including Harmony Gold's version of Dragonball).
</li><li> A bit of a convoluted case happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets">Battle of the Planets</a></em>: The voice actor Alan Dinehart was actually the son of an elder Alan Dinehart, but opted to drop any "Junior" title. <em>His</em> own son, the third Dinehart in line, was instead credited with "Jr.", causing much confusion for a time.
</li><li> Sally Donovan was initially credited under the alias "Elizabeth Mann" for her work in the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em>, though later episodes began crediting her under her actual name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMichaelRichardson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMichaelRichardson">Kevin Michael Richardson</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/not_comics_my_brother_whit_interviews_voice_actor_kevin_michael_richardson/">always wanted to voice the character of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>. He's not yet been regularly cast in the role (though he did get to fill in for Khary Payton when the latter was unavailable for one of the <em>New Teen Titans</em> segments), but he has used the character's real name, "Victor Stone", as an alias when he voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>'s Heihachi Mishima in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">SoulCalibur</a> II</em>.
</li><li> Latin American and Spaniard voice actors have an interesting twist on this: Unless stated otherwise, most of them use their second first name and their first (maternal) or second (paternal) name of their last name. As an example, Mexican voice actor Luis Eduardo Garza Escudero (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Krillin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Ichigo</a>) goes credited as only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EduardoGarza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EduardoGarza">Eduardo Garza</a>. Unlike Japanese and American voice actors, they rarely use stage names for hiding their identities in non-union or risky works (as it's considered rather stupid anyways there) and when they do, it's mostly because they like to use that name for other reasons unrelated with their work or maybe because their fans and friends prefer to call them by those names instead:
<ul><li> Gabriela Schietter Castañon goes credited as Gaby Willer or Gabriela Willert (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Li Meiling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Motoko Kusanagi</a>). Her mother, Liza Willert, was born as Elizabeth Margot Schreiter Castañón.
</li><li> Gabriel Basurto (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Sesshoumaru</a>) is quite a complex example: He was credited sometimes as such and sometimes as "Alfredo Basurto" as his full name is <em>Alfredo Gabriel Basurto Contreras</em>. This caused many fans to think both names referred to two unrelated voice actors with the same last name.
</li><li> The late Maria Hiromi Hayakawa Salas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonsterHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonsterHigh">Draculaura</a>) went only as <em>Hiromi Hayakawa</em>, causing many fans to think she is a native Japanese voice actress (She was Japanese-Mexican born in Japan, but raised in Mexico). Later she went with the name of <em>Hiromi</em> exclusively, especially when working outside of the voice acting industry.
</li><li> Another Japanese-Mexican voice actress, whose real name is Noriko Takaya Satori, goes with the more simpler name of <em>Noriko</em> as her stage name.
</li><li> The late Guillermo Romano's (who voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Rayearth</a>, among others) real name was Carlos Stevenson, who also used that name in few other works, causing some confusion at first among his fans when trying to identify his previous early roles.
</li><li> Azul Valadez (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">Tatsumaki</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChillingAdventuresOfSabrina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChillingAdventuresOfSabrina">Sabrina Spellman</a>): Her real name is Azucena Valadez. She goes with that name because "Azul" (blue) is her favorite color.
</li></ul></li><li> French voice actor Boris Trouillard is better known by his stage name "Boris Rehlinger". His son, Kylian, is also known by both last names.
</li><li> Most, if not all, modern Japanese voice actors use stage names due to Japanese culture and laws valuing privacy and being fairly strict about it; it also doesn't help that most voice actors these days are held to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> status and are big celebrities in their own right. In addition to their normal stage names, they also adopt aliases when working in risky works like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a>. Sometimes their stage names are also their <em>real names</em>, except written with a different alphabet, due of the way how Japanese language works:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NanaMizuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NanaMizuki">Nana Mizuki</a>'s real name is Nana Kondou, and it's pretty obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">why she changed her name</a>, just ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">Kanako Kondou (Noel Vermillion)</a>. Her younger sister Mika Kondou performs under the name <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiKA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiKA">Mi KA</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Yukana">Yukana</a>: Real name is Yukana Nogami, and she was credited as such in older 90's works
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NobutoshiCanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NobutoshiCanna">Nobutoshi Canna</a>: Real name is Nobutoshi Hayashi, and like the previous case, he's credited as such in older works.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaisukeKishio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaisukeKishio">Daisuke Kishio</a> is one of the cases when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName">Stage Name</a> is his real-life one: his given name is written in hiragana, rather than kanji like his real-life one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HisakoKanemoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HisakoKanemoto">Hisako Kanemoto</a>: Real name is Juri Aikawa, and oddly enough she uses her real name in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KoumajouDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KoumajouDensetsu">Koumajou Densetsu</a></em> as Flandre Scarlet,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note66bcw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note66bcw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note66bcw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Albeit only in the original Japanese. In the English translation, she is credited under her stage name instead.</span> despite not being an h-game and also the rest of the cast uses both their real and stage names as well.
</li><li> Nozomi Sasaki, who voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Patricia Martin</a>, has an interesting twist on this: Both her real and stage name are the same, but her stage one is <em>always</em> written in hiragana, while her real name is written in kanji. This was done to avoid confusion because her real name in kanji shares the <em>same</em> characters with her fellow veteran voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NozomuSasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NozomuSasaki">Nozomu Sasaki</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoshKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoshKeaton">Josh Keaton</a>'s real name is Joshua Luis Wiener, given the fact that he's half Peruvian from his mother's side and half Ashkenazi Jewish from his father's side.
</li><li> Erin Grey Van Oosbree goes by her middle name Grey and married Christopher DeLisle in 1992 before divorcing him a year later, prior to starting her voice acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a> by taking her first married name. While she's frequently credited by her first married name, in recent productions, she's been credited as Grey Griffin (or Grey <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeLisle">De Lisle</a>-Griffin) after marrying Jared Griffin in 2012.
</li><li> After marrying Craig Strong in 1999, Tara Charendorff began being credited by her married name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong">Tara Strong</a>.
</li><li> Venezuelan voice actress María Teresa Guedes Medina dropped her second family name and merged her first and second name together to become Maythe Guedes.

It's much, MUCH easier to name all the aversions: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill">Lauryn Hill</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott">Missy Elliott</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WyclefJean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WyclefJean">Wyclef Jean</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheophilusLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheophilusLondon">Theophilus London</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithMurray">Keith Murray</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceStaples" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceStaples">Vince Staples</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeBudden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeBudden">Joe Budden</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeJones">Mike Jones</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KevinMcCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KevinMcCall">Kevin Mc Call</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrysonTiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrysonTiller">Bryson Tiller</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ObieTrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ObieTrice">Obie Trice</a> (who actually has a song about not having a stage name). <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalibKweli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalibKweli">Talib Kweli</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KendrickLamar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KendrickLamar">Kendrick Lamar</a> use their first and middle names, but this counts as more of a mononym than a proper aversion (Kendrick's real last name, embarrassingly enough, is Duckworth).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> goes by her middle name, her full name being Robyn Rihanna Fenty.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s original last name was Zimmerman, but he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan (first "Dillon", after Sheriff Dillon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em>; the current spelling is inspired by Dylan Thomas) many years ago.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a> has plenty.
<ul><li> Among the original lineup, Chaim Witz became Gene Simmons, Stanley Harvey Eisen = Paul Stanley, George Peter John Criscuola = Peter Criss, and Paul Daniel "Ace" Frehley.
</li><li> Among the replacements, Paul Caravello = Eric Carr, Vinnie Cusano = Vinnie Vincent, Mark Norton = Mark St. John.
</li></ul></li><li> In the world of music, David Jones adopted the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> to distinguish himself from Davy Jones of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> is something of an exception, as he legally changed his name to Elton John before he became famous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lights">Lights</a> had her name legally changed to such. It was the only way she could use the name, as there was already a signed band called "Lights".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s first line up were a subversion of this. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy</a>" and "Geezer" are actually the substantially less cool John and Terry, but they were given the nicknames in school and they stuck.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio">Ronnie James Dio</a> is actually Ronald James Pavadona, but he assumed a stage name modeled after mafia boss Johnny Dio.
</li><li> Similarly, the late Bon Scott of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> was born Ronald Scott (his mother still refers to him as "Ron" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> <em>Behind the Music</em> episode featuring AC/DC), but, as he was from Scotland, his classmates nicknamed him "The Bon Scott", or Bon for short.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a> of the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> was born Farrokh Bulsara. Although he had been nicknamed Freddie since he was a schoolboy.
</li><li> Sabrina Bryan, one of The Cheetah Girls, is best known by her full name of Reba Sabrina Hinojos (as director Oz Scoot puts her on one of his made for TV feature films on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a></em> in 2003).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirEnGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirEnGrey">Dir en grey</a>: Both the vocalist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kyo">Kyo</a>, and the bassist, Toshiya, are guilty of this. Toshiya's full name is Toshimasa Hara, and while Kyo's real name is debated by most fans, most sites credit him as either "Tooru Niimura" or "Toru Nishimura". The Tooru Niimura/Nishimura thing is a bit of a joke that international fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">took seriously</a>. Tooru Niimura is the name of a famous Japanese pornography director, and Kyo signed his name as Tooru Niimura on several of his written works as a joke. Nishimura is a mistranslation of Niimura. No one knows for certain what Kyo's birth name is, especially since he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLiar">Self-Proclaimed Liar</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Trent Reznor's</a> full name is Michael Trent Reznor, but as he has explained, "My father is Michael Reznor."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> (the first lineup, at least) all took their names from the juxtaposition of an American icon and a serial killer. In the case of the titular frontman (born Brian Hugh Warner), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a>.
</li><li> Vincent Furnier took a feminine first name and named himself and his band after that name: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>.
</li><li> William Michael Albert Broad got a "William is idle" comment on a report card, so he took the stage name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Billy Idol</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Buckethead">Buckethead</a>, a guitarist who doesn't only have a stage name (almost everybody only knows his first name, "Brian"), but also a stage <em>identity</em> (which consists of a rather creepy man from a chicken farm, who wears a KFC bucket on his head and a mask to hid his allegedly mangled face). He will never wear anything else when performing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> was originally, and still is legally, Richard Starkey. The cowboy-based nickname partially emerges from his ringed fingers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> is actually James Paul McCartney, but has also been credited under a number of unusual names - some notable ones include The Fireman, Apollo C. Vermouth, Percy 'Thrills' Thrillington (who had a self-titled album) and Paul Ramon, whose name was taken by all of The Ramones (see next example).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> was fond of the pseudonym 'Dr Winston O'Boogie' (Winston was his middle name, after Winston Churchill).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> did some guest guitarist spots hidden under the pseudonym <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousItalian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousItalian">L'Angelo Misterioso</a> (The Mysterious Angel).
</li><li> Mike McGear, of fellow Liverpool group The Scaffold, was, in reality, Peter Michael McCartney, brother of Paul. He invented the new surname ("gear" being a synonym for "fab" at the time) to avoid accusations of leeching off his brother's fame (and other unwelcome comparisons).
</li></ul></li><li> Beatallica has stage names combining the Fab Four, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Xtreme Kool Letterz</a>: Jaymz Lennfield, Krk McBurtney, Grg Hammetson, and Ringo Larz.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a>: Dee Dee Ramone (Douglas Colvin), Johnny Ramone (John Cummings), Joey Ramone (Jeffry Hyman), Tommy Ramone (Thomas Erdelyi), Marky Ramone (Marc Bell), Richie Ramone (Richard Reinhardt), Elvis Ramone (Clem Burke) and C. J. Ramone (Christopher Joseph Ward). The surname came from the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> hid his identity in hotels by registering under Paul Ramon.
</li><li> Also Beatles-inspired: Buster Bloodvessel (Douglas William Trendle), the hefty, skinheaded frontman of UK ska group Bad Manners. Buster Bloodvessel was the name of Ivor Cutler's character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour">Magical Mystery Tour</a></em> film.
</li><li> Each member of the band Malice Mizer go under stage names, many of which have hidden their actual identity.
</li><li> Miyavi (formerly of Dué le Quartz, now a solo artist) doesn't seem to much care — it's pretty widely known that his real name is Takamasa Ishihara. Things like his Facebook page are generally under the name Miyavi Ishihara, however, because it entertains him more.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManWithAMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManWithAMission">Man With a Mission</a>, whose members are named Tokyo Tanaka, Kamikaze Boy, Jean-Ken Johnny, DJ Santa Monica and Spear Rib. Their real names (or faces for that matter, since they always wear masks) are unknown.
</li><li> Kevin James LaBrie of Dream Theater assumed the stage name James LaBrie because there were already two Johns in the band (John Petrucci on guitars and John Myung on bass) and they didn't want another name match with keyboardist Kevin Moore.
</li><li> W.A.S.P. frontman Blackie Lawless is a good example. Everyone knows him as Blackie, mainly because Stephen Duren is a somewhat boring name for someone that wore a circular saw codpiece.
</li><li> Pick a black metal musician. Any black metal musician. They come in four flavors: nods to other bands or songs (Hellhammer, Euronymous, etc.), references to violence or other taboo subjects (Necrobutcher, Nocturno Culto, etc.), references to fantasy or paganism/the occult (Fenriz, Count Grishnackh, etc.), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">"evil" sounding gibberish</a> (Ihsahn, Samoth, Gaahl, Abbath, Horgh, Zingultus, etc., etc.). Like most everything about black metal, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">completely ridiculous and silly</a>, yet fans take it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">very seriously</a> and get offended when people remind them that it is ridiculous and silly. All of the aforementioned stage names are real musicians.
</li><li> Prior to becoming famous, the musician Declan MacManus changed his name to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>. However, in the mid-80s, Costello legally changed his name <em>back</em> to Declan MacManus. Although he continued to record and perform as Elvis Costello, his songs started being credited to MacManus. This began around the same time he co-wrote several songs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, and he's said that part of the reason for the change back was just because he thought "McCartney / MacManus" would look cool.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting">Sting</a> was born Gordon Matthew Sumner and got his nickname from a yellow and black striped sweater that he liked to wear on stage. Even his family call him Sting today.
</li><li> German singer Freddy Quinn, best known for schlager/shanty-type songs in Germany, was born Franz Eugen Nidl-Petz. And he's actually Austrian.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> bassist John Paul Jones was born John Baldwin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> was born "Destiny Hope Cyrus". The "Miley" came from "smiley", due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">her upbeat nature as a young child</a>. She legally changed her name though. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a>, however, is still a stage name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">defictionalized</a> from her TV character on a television show. After her 2018 marriage, her name is legally Miley Ray Hemsworth but she still uses Cyrus professionally.
</li><li> While reading the original cast list of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em>, it's easy to assume no one is actually born with a name as pretty as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahBrightman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahBrightman">Sarah Brightman</a>. However, that <em>is</em> her real name - but her costar Michael Crawford was born Michael Dumble-Smith.
</li><li> Spanish singer and actress Charo is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">María Rosario Pilar Martínez Molina Moquiere de les Esperades Santa Ana Romanguera y de la Najosa Rasten</a>.
</li><li> Nicholas James Bates became Nick Rhodes for "aesthetic reasons". His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">Duran Duran</a> bandmate Nigel John Taylor goes by his middle name.
</li><li> A rare Japanese example: Masato Shimon, who changed his name from Masaharu Fujikawa, has gone under several names, including Akira Tani, Kouichi Fuji and Ryou Kisao.
</li><li> Alecia Beth Moore decided to use the stage name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a> (either with an I or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle">exclamation</a>). She's said in interviews she got it as a nickname in high school from Mr. Pink in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> bands:
<ul><li> Every member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a>; the lead singer shortened from from Vincent Neil Wharton to Vince Neil, the drummer shortened from Thomas Lee Bass to Tommy Lee, the guitarist's real name is Robert Alan Deal but he uses the cooler stage name Mick Mars, and bassist Frank Carlton Serafino Ferrana Jr. legally changed his name to Nikki Sixx when he was eighteen, before Mötley Crüe had even formed.
</li><li> Everyone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison">Poison</a>'s classic lineup. Vocalist Bret Michael Sychak shortened his name to Bret Michaels, bassist Robert Kuykendall shortened to Bobby Dall, and drummer Richard Ream changed his name to Rikki Rockett. Original lead guitarist Matt Smith, the only original member who used his real name, was replaced by Bruce "C.C. DeVille" Johanneson. C.C. was then replaced by Richie Kotzen (his real name), and Kotzen by Blues Saraceno (surprise, surprise - his real name as well!).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatle-esque</a> glam rockers Enuff Z'nuff featured men named Donald Vandervelde, Gregory Rybarski, and Victor Cerny. To fans, they're vocalist Donnie Vie, guitarist and band namesake Chip Z'nuff, and drummer Vikk Foxx respectively.
</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Warrant">Warrant</a>'s members went by their real names, but the unfortunately-named John Kennedy Oswald (later changed legally to John Patrick Oswald) went by the more glam-friendly name Jani Lane.
</li><li> Likewise, everyone in Faster Pussycat used their real names, save for their vocalist, Gustave "Gus" Molvik, a.k.a. Taime Downe.
</li><li> Bulletboys singer Mark Maytorena's real name is a bit of a mouthful, so he tweaked the spelling of his first name and shortened his last name, becoming Marq Torien.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister">Twisted Sister</a>: Daniel "Dee" Snider, John "Jay Jay" French Segall, Eddie "Fingers" Ojeda, Mark Glickman = Mark "The Animal" Mendoza and Anthony Jude "A. J." Pero. In Pero's case, he usually went by Tony, but partly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>, had to go by "A.J." since the band had just recently had another drummer named Tony. His new nickname stuck till his death in 2015.
</li><li> While better known in the hair metal scene as a club owner and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> VJ, Riki Rachtman wasn't born as Richard as one may expect, but as David Alan Rachtman.
</li><li> L.A. Guns guitarist and band namesake Tracii Guns was born Tracy Ulrich.
</li><li> Finnish band Hanoi Rocks mostly opted for Western-sounding pseudonyms: Matti Fagerholm became Michael Monroe, Antti Hulkko became Andy McCoy, Jan-Markus Stenfors became Nasty Suicide, and Sami Takamaki became Sami Yaffa. English drummer Nicholas "Razzle" Dingley mostly went by his real name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SkidRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SkidRow">Skid Row</a>'s Sebastian Bach is actually Sebastian Bierk. You've also got bassist Rachel Bolan, who is male — his birth name is James Richard Southworth, and his stage name partly a tribute to T-Rex singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarcBolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarcBolan">Marc Bolan</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe">Europe</a> is all over the place when it comes to stage names. Lead singer and only constant member Joey Tempest was born, and legally remains, Rolf Magnus Joakim Larsson. On the other hand, all three of the band's bassists used their real namesPeter Olsson (original), Marcel Jacob (briefly in 1981), and John Levén, who has performed on all of the band's studio albums. Original and current lead guitarist John Norum uses his real name, but Kee Marcello (who took over when Norum left in 1986, but didn't come back when the band ended a hiatus in 2003) was born Kjell Hilding Lövbom. Original drummer Tony Niemistö became Tony Reno. His successor on drums, Jan-Håkan Haugland, performs as Ian Haugland. Longtime keyboardist Gunnar Mathias Michaeli performs as Mic Michaeli.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>'s Paul Hewson is better known as Bono (from his early stage name "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin">Bono Vox</a> - <em>good voice</em> - of O'Connell Street"; Brazil still adds a "Vox" as his surname) and his bandmate David Evans is The Edge.
</li><li> Ryan Ross, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">formerly of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco">Panic! at the Disco</a> and now of The Young Veins, had his name changed from George Ryan Ross III. Spencer James Smith V is another former member who dropped his numerical name for the simpler, snippier Spencer Smith.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a> has two instances - Peter Lewis Kingston Wentz III is now known as Pete Wentz, while Patrick Martin Stumph went from Patrick Stump to Patrick Vaughn Stump.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>: Geddy Lee was born Gary Lee Weinrib ("Geddy" comes from his mother's heavy accent), and legally changed his first name to Geddy. Alex Lifeson is really Aleksandar ivojinović ("Lifeson" is a literal English translation). Neil Peart was really Neil Peart.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MuddyWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MuddyWaters">Muddy Waters</a> was born McKinley Morganfield.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HowlinWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HowlinWolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>'s real name was Chester Arthur Burnett.

</li><li> Steven Georgiou went by the stage name Cat Stevens, apparently inspired by a girlfriend telling him he had eyes like a cat. After converting to Islam he legally changed his name to Yusuf Islam ("Yusuf" being the Arabic form of "Joseph", a name he'd always liked) — he has recently begun recording music under the single name "Yusuf", in his words "because 'Islam' doesn't have to be sloganised".

There's a book called <em>Bliss</em>. The main character's name is Harry Joy and his grandfather is Vance Joy. He's the storyteller and a crazy old man. Plus, I thought it was a cool name."

The name change partially came about when he was a boy. When his parents divorced, his mother resumed her maiden name of Malmsteen and gave the same surname to their children.

</li><li> All the members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> had slightly altered names when they started their respective careers in the 1960s. Anni-Frid Lyngstad started calling herself Frida while performing in a jazz band, Göran Andersson called himself Benny while performing in a rock band, and Agnetha Fältskog added the H to her name to distinguish herself from another Agneta in a band she sang in. Björn's a slightly different case since his father was the one who changed his surname to Ulvaeus, because he felt Andersson was too common. (The elder Ulvaeus certainly had a point, because otherwise all the credited composers in ABBA songs would be "S. Anderson, B. Andersson, and B. Andersson", and <strike>chaos</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity</a> would have ensued.)

</li><li> Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have produced all their albums since the mid-'70s using the name "The Glimmer Twins".
</li><li> The band also credit the stage name Nanker Phelge for songs they've written collectively.

Furthermore, Lemmy (Ian Fraser Kilminster - see Motorhead example) filled in on bass for a period in the '70s while they were between bassists, and Sid Vicious (John Simon Ritchie) was going to try for lead singer, but failed to turn up for the audition.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a>: Frontman Mark Arm was born Mark Thomas McLaughlin. The stage name came from some sort of in-joke about using body parts as insults.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLegend">John Legend</a>s name is actually John Stephens. It was a nickname a friend from high school called him that grew into his stage name. He felt like his real name wasnt marketable because both John and Stephens are very common names.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StVincent">St. Vincent</a>s name is Annie Clark but uses a stage name because there is a Canadian actress by the same name.

X-ene. <em>Get it?</em>) Guitarist Billy Zoom was born Tyson Kindell; John Doe's real name is John Nommensen Duchac. Drummer D.J. Bonebrake, meanwhile, was born...Donald J. Bonebrake.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a> was born Marvin Lee Aday. The stage name was originally a childhood nickname given to him by his parents, because, for the opening months of his life, his skin was the colour of raw meatloaf.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a> was born Anna Mae Bullock. Her marriage to Ike Turner doesn't really subvert this  she had already been performing with him under her stage name for around two years before they actually got hitched.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s legal name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. She chose the name from the song "Radio Gaga" by Queen, given to her by her producer for her theatrical approach to music. Contrary to what some sources say, Gaga had been quoted many times saying that she makes "absolutely no distinction between Stefani and Gaga." She calls this her "favorite question."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop">Iggy Pop</a> was born James Newell Osterberg.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a> has Michael "Mike Dirnt" Pritchard (the surname is how he imitates a bass' sound) and Tré Cool (as if Frank Edwin Wright III is not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">"Awesome McCool" Name</a> enough). Yet Billie Joe Armstrong is the singer's actual name. That said, the side project the Foxboro Hot Tubs lists its members as Michael Pritchard, Frank Edwin Wright III, and the Reverend Strychnine Twitch. (And Green Day's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">tour guitarist</a> Jason White is Frosco Lee.)

</li><li> Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich started off performing under their nicknames, spotlighted this by naming the band after them, then racked up three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Other Darrins</a> as replacement band members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">adopted their predecessors nicknames</a>.

In the years before Slash and Duff returned, only a few also fit the trope, such as Ronald Jay Blumenthal = Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal (though he's also simply referred to as "Bumblefoot") and Daren Jay "DJ" Ashba.
<ul><li> The funny thing is that one of the bands William Bailey (born William Bruce Rose Jr., before his mom remarried) was in before GNR was called A.X.L. That band broke up and William Bailey used the name for himself.

If they don't choose a cool stage name, they will go by their given name only. In Korean you are NEVER called by your given name, unless your are foreign or possibly by your close family. So, 'Hong Gil Dong' would be called as 'Hong Gil Dong', but if he was a singer he would just be 'Gil Dong' unless he chose a different stage name.

</li><li> British singer Christopher Hamill dropped his first name and rearranged the letters of his last name to become Limahl. His former band, Kajagoogoo, were mostly aversions; all used their real names except Jez Strode, and even he used his real family name and a nickname (real first name Jeremy).

</li><li> Alaina Marie Beaton once gave the impression of being more than one person with the stage name Porcelain and the Tramps. She is now known as Porcelain Black.
</li><li> LiSA's stage name is doubly apt, reflecting both her old band <strong>L</strong>ove <strong>i</strong>s <strong>S</strong>ame <strong>A</strong>ll, and her real name, Risa.
</li><li> Randy California, singer and guitarist for the psychedelic rock band Spirit, was born Randy Craig Wolfe. The stage name originated earlier in his career, when he became the newest addition to the group Jimmy James And The Blue Flames, fronted by a then-unknown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>: The band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">already had a member named Randy</a>, bassist Randy Palmer, so Hendrix came up with differentiating them by their home states - Palmer became Randy Texas and Wolfe became Randy California.

<ul><li> Richey Edwards of the band was commonly referred to in the early 90s as Richey James, but his disappearance made Edwards the more frequent use. Richey James Edwards sometimes occurs too.

</li><li> Chuck Dukowski was born Gary McDaniel. His stage name was inspired by a Zippo lighter he found with "Chuck The Duke" engraved on it; "The duke" became "Dukowski" because he thought "Chuck The Duke" would sound too "macho", and because he wanted to take on a Polish-sounding name as a form of protest against Polish jokes. He's also been credited under his real name and the slight variation "Charles Dukowski".

</li><li> Raymond Ginn, brother of founding member Greg Ginn, was a member of a very early lineup of the band, but is much better known for designing album covers, fliers, and other artwork for the group under the name Raymond Pettibon. The last name Pettibon came from a nickname given to him by his father, "petit bon", meaning "good little one". It's been speculated by others that he originally wanted to avoid using his birth name because "Ray Ginn" sounded too much like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Reagan</a>".
</li><li> Greg Ginn was credited in the liner notes to Black Flag's <em>My War</em> under both his own name and "Dale Nixon", as an attempt to downplay the fact that the group was without a bassist and Ginn had to record those parts himself. The name has subsequently been used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> by other groups, either because someone in the band played multiple instruments or because the real musician couldn't be credited for contractual reasons: For instance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> was credited as Dale Nixon for his work on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Melvins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Melvins">Melvins</a>' <em>King Buzzo</em> EP.

However, this was for more traditional reasons: she got married to a man named Dennis Benatar, but they divorced before her music career started. She had already established herself by the time she married her guitarist/manager Neil Giraldo, so no professional name change there.
</li><li> John Michael Stipe dropped his first name and started going by Michael Stipe.

He continued to be billed as Raphael Wiggins as part of the group Tony! Toni! Toné!, but for the group's final album and his subsequent solo career, he became Raphael Saadiq. Because "Saadiq" is Arabic for "man of his word", there were rumors he had converted to Islam: He'd later clarify that he had not - he wanted to change his surname to differentiate himself from his brother, Dwayne Wiggins (who had also been in Tony! Toni! Toné!), and just thought "Saadiq" sounded cool.

</li><li> North Vietnamese communist leader Hồ Chí Minh (born Nguyễn Sinh Cung) constructed his final <em>nom de guerre</em> from the common Vietnamese surname "Hồ" with the given name "Chí Minh" (= enlightened will).

</li><li> Ján Ludvík Hoch, a Czechoslovakian Jew, arrived in Britain in 1940 as a refugee from the Nazis. Having joined the army, helped liberate Europe, and received an officers commission and promotion to captain, he was made to adopt a new name: Ian Robert Maxwell. Robert Maxwell, as he later styled himself, went on to achieve fame and infamy with the rise and fall of his media empire, and his eventual death by drowning.

<ul><li> Ron Artest, on the other hand, changed his name to Metta World Peace in part because of some religious awakening, but mostly to distance himself from his own reputation.

</li><li> Brazilian artists who worked for Marvel or DC use "Americanized" versions of their names. It started when an editor at Malibu Comics thought Deodato Taumaturgo Borges Filho was too Latino to get accepted, so it became Mike Deodato Jr. (at times he drops the Jr., alluding to how "Filho" = son). Then Eduardo Barros became phonetic with Eddy Barrows, and José Edilbenes Bezerra built Ed Benes out of his middle name.
</li><li> Jaime King used the name James King during her modelling career because there was already a model named Jaime in her agency.

The show's host had to change his on-air name to match the series title. While his legal name remained James Kenneth McManus for the rest of his life, he decided he liked his new on-air name. McManus went on to become a sportscasting legend, most notably on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WideWorldOfSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WideWorldOfSports">Wide World of Sports</a></em>, as Jim McKay.
</li><li> Longtime TV and radio host Larry King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger.

He legally changed his name to "Larry King" within two years.

When she went on her misguided vendetta against Koro-sensei, she instead used another stage name from a character she played in the past: <em>Kaede Kayano</em>.

</li><li> Piccolo uses the alias Ma Junior whenever he enters the Tenkaichi Budokai to hide his true identity as the reincarnation of the Great Demon King Piccolo. The "Ma" (マ) in "Ma Junior" is a pun of "Ma" (魔) which means "demon", making it sound like "Demon Junior".
</li><li> While it is unknown whether the name of human God possessed to enter the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai is actually named Shen or not, the name does serve as an alias for God. "Shen" (シェン) is a pun of "Shen" (神) from Shenlong, which uses the same kanji for "god". That alias serves as a hint for Son Goku to figure out who Shen really is.
</li><li> Subverted with Shin. When he enters the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, he uses the name Shin (シン). Like in the case of Shen, it's a pun on "Shin" (神), which is part of the title called "Kaioshin".
