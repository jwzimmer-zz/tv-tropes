This can also happen to someone whose picture of the opposing position is such a grotesque caricature that it renders them unable to tell parody from reality. Reality and parody are further blended by the fact that something that started as a parody might turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical">Windmill Political</a> that some people take as gospel and go to a very serious (if not literal) war.

Poe phrased his law thus: "Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake it for the genuine article."

Unfortunately, the actor playing Hitler himself was so terrible that the audience assumed that it was a parody, and the show sold out.

Random House accepts the book at face value as a fierce portrayal of the Black experience and pays six hundred grand for it.

The Toth persona was a parody of a low-information Nixon supporter: jingoistic, clueless, earnest, and maddeningly obtuse. It is the printed pre-cursor to Stephen Colbert. The targets of his correspondence often took his letters at face value and sent sincere replies. Occasionally "Toth" would string them along through several rounds. One example: Toth wrote a letter to the "Mr Bubble" corporation asking how he was supposed to use the product given the admonition on the box to "KEEP DRY". An excerpt from the lengthy reply: "It is true, we do say on our box: Free Flowing 'MR BUBBLE' must be kept dry. By this statement we mean that the box of powder should be protected against dampness, such as moisture in the bathroom if the box is not put away. The box of 'MR. BUBBLE' should be closed and placed in a cabinet until the next use. Some people tell us they transfer the 'MR BUBBLE' powder to a plastic container, or even a large coffee can, to keep dampness out of the powder. Some have mentioned they keep a measuring scoop in the can for convenient measuring of the proper mount of powder to use in each bath. Over-use is only wasteful."

A quick glance at the comments on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> page shows how many people thought they were for real. Given that each of those sketches involved John Clarke playing all of the political figures without any change in voice, costume, or makeup, anyone who watched more than one should have very quickly realized that he was not both Prime Minister Rudd and Senator Stephen Conroy, but was in fact a sketch comedian. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">he was not Rudd's successor, Julia Gillard</a>.
</li><li> Performance artists The Yes Men have made a career out of this, or at least they did during the Bush administration. One of their projects included passing out surveys  <a class="urllink" href="http://theyesmen.org/petitions/pdfs/petition-terrorathome.pdf">http://theyesmen.org/petitions/pdfs/petition-terrorathome.pdf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>  under their "Yes, Bush Can!" slogan letterhead, urging people at Republican rallies to specify the rights they were willing to waive in the name of the War on Terror. They had assumed people would be shocked, but instead the audiences filled them out and turned them back in. Before reaching unavoidable notoriety, the Yes Men had managed to pull off their satire so effectively, that serious business and economic forums were <em>inviting</em> them to speak; of course, they gleefully complied. One such presentation of note, given at an international textile industry conference, had them deconstructing the U.S. Civil War as secretly fought because the North didn't want to lose access to cheap Southern cotton, and ended with them demonstrating a prototype employee-monitoring device that hangs off the user and resembles a giant golden penis. The audience ate it up. The Yes Men themselves expressed astonishment at just how far into the absurd they could go and still have so-called professional audiences taking them seriously.
</li><li> Swedish humor show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grotesco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grotesco">Grotesco</a></em> featured a song called <em>Det är bögarnas fel</em> ("It's the gay men's fault") which became a hit and can be watched <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/T1lvMJ-l0_A">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It's a textbook example of this trope. The song is sung by a reverend who claims that gay men are to blame for every single bad thing in the world and sings that "I don't know the line and verse, chapter or part, but somewhere in [the Bible] it says that it's the gay men's fault." He and lots of other singers then go on to give gay men the blame for things that clearly aren't gay men's fault. One woman sings that "My son shot four people to death with the hunting-rifle. Somehow, I feel that it's the gay men's fault." A man sings that "I once ate porridge and confused curry for cinnamon, and that wasn't carelessness; no, it was the gay men's fault." It's almost impossible to imagine how it could be more obviously satiric, and <em>still,</em> when it was performed live on the family show <em>Allsång på Skansen,</em> somebody reported the show to the police for being upsetting to homosexuals.
</li><li> Another Swedish comedian, Ronny Eriksson, wrote a song in the late eighties that parodied racism. The song, titled "<em>Storswänsken</em>" ("the Great Swede") is sung from the point of view of a person who's opposed to every single thing that was invented outside Sweden. It contains lines such as "Don't believe for a second that the earth is round, 'cause some darkie thought that up", "Get rid of the alphabet and all damn numbers" and "down with science". About twenty years later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic">young Swedish racists began to sing the song as their anthem</a>. Eriksson's only comment was that clearly, some people are too stupid to realize when they are being insulted.
</li><li> Noted by Doug Stanhope in his <em>No Refunds</em> Tour, when he recalls performing at Edinburgh Fringe Festival. When commenting on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a> antisemitism controversy, he noted that people shouldn't care what Gibson thinks and the media shouldn't give Gibson any attention. Cue Stanhope noting he actually needs the publicity, he jokingly noted he'd happily say "I hate the Jews" for a little media attention, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">only for a journalist to take it as an antisemitism admission, before quoting him saying "I hate the Jews."</a>
</li><li> Stand-up comedienne Suzi Ruffell got into trouble for a stand-up routine intended to illustrate how white British people, without intending to and with the best of intentions, can come over as being somewhat racist. Before she knew it she was being dubbed "racist comedian Suzi Ruffell" and similar inaccurate descriptions.
</li><li> Fred Armisen's <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nECoe4eCp_o">Complicated Drumming Technique: Jens Hannemann<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was a parody of drumming instruction videos featuring needlessly complex and masturbatory parts with extremely large drum setups that contained components that were either largely superfluous or used to the point where the part was irreducibly complex and would not easily translate to smaller setups. Many viewers who were not aware of the video's origins, but were aware of the kind of videos that Armisen was parodying took it completely seriously.

There's evidence both ways  on the one hand, a number of ideas seem weirdly out of place (Snape being evil, callouts to Tom Bombadil or Bela Lugosi's Dead) and the story's deterioration in spelling and grammar doesn't quite match up with the supposed loss of its editor. On the other hand, people who were around at the time of the story's publication have pointed out that its level of quality was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">actually pretty typical.</a> Its publication time doesn't help, as it happened at <em>just</em> the point when all its common tropes were being discredited.

When it was shown to test audiences, they took it just as seriously as the real thing.
</li><li> Many people think <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeeMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeeMovie">Bee Movie</a></em> is unintentionally stupid (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">which may explain</a> its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> status) when a stupid movie was actually what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySeinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySeinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> was going for.

Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">the film ended up a box-office bomb as a result</a>.
</li><li> In documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Religulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Religulous">Religulous</a></em>, Bill Maher disguises himself and starts preaching the <em>actual</em> tenets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Scientology</a> on a park; naturally, most people laugh at him and call him crazy, unaware that those were Scientologists' real beliefs.
</li><li> A minor example of this happened after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a> made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a>.</em> She commented later, with some surprise, "Adults find it funny. They are the ones who are laughing. Young people watch it like a reality show. It's much too close to their real experiences so they are not exactly guffawing." She apparently meant it to be parody, but didn't take it far enough and it was too realistic for kids to get the joke.
</li><li> For that matter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em> (of which <em>Mean Girls</em> is a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>) was originally meant to be nothing more than a spoof of high school shooting cases, even taking place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">suburban Ohio</a> to make things all the more ridiculous. Many people, however, interpreted the film as a genuine deconstruction of high school cliques and teen movie cliches, and it was soon branded a top-tier high school movie.
</li><li> Prior to the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a>'s sci-fi epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>, a curious blog popped up called "<a class="urllink" href="http://stopavatarmovie.blogspot.com/">Stop Avatar Movie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." The blog's editor claims to be a transgender woman who is offended by the "heterosexual themes" found in the movie (namely, the apparent lack of non-heterosexual, non-cisgender characters), and urges people to boycott it. She goes so far as to make <em>Avatar</em> the scapegoat for anything in the wider culture that is or could be remotely construed as homophobic/transphobic, regardless of whether or not the thing or incident being discussed has anything to do with the film. The political and social views expressed on the blog are so extreme that even actual gay people are divided on whether the author is just a very dedicated troll, or legitimately insane. For all we know, the blog could have been started to covertly <em>help</em> the film; at one point, the writer actually encourages the offended to <em>buy tickets</em> and then not see the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CSATheConfederateStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CSATheConfederateStatesOfAmerica">C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America</a></em> is a mockumentary based on an alternate history where the Confederacy wins the Civil War. Said mockumentary details an America, with slavery as part of modern way life, bat-shit crazy politics dictated and decided in part by the desire and need for human chattel, and numerous fictional, parody products with extremely racist overtones. Then the mockumentary comes to its conclusion, and you find out that a lot of those ridiculous, over the top products that couldn't possibly exist, actually did, and were actually being sold for decades. The whole totalitarian plot to conquer the entire New World from top to bottom, that sounds like the alternate ending for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildWildWest">The Wild Wild West</a></em>, or possibly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: yeah, that was actually the plan all along, and something the Confederacy would have attempted had they won the Civil War. Suddenly, the mockumentary, while still a bit ham-handed in presentation, becomes a little more uncomfortable to watch...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondTheValleyOfTheDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondTheValleyOfTheDolls">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a></em> is an infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">over-the-top parody</a> of sexploitation films. However, when screenwriter and director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> and Russ Meyer later met the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>, they were nonplussed when Johnny Rotten expressed his admiration for the movie because it was <em>so true to life</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat">Borat</a></em> was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and the European Center for Antiziganism Research for its depiction of Borat's racism and Antisemitism. The film is actually parodying such beliefs and attempting to expose acceptance of them in Borat's unwitting interview guests. In fact, Sacha Baron Cohen is himself a practicing Jew.
</li><li> At one point, there was a popular image macro making the rounds on Facebook which made fun of fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em> who supposedly contradict Tyler's "don't talk about Fight Club" mantra by... well, talking about <em>Fight Club.</em> Of course, in the film itself, Tyler coins that saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReversePsychology">specifically because he knows people will disobey it,</a> and thus expand his sphere of influence.
</li><li> Some audiences complained that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">"the actor playing Joseph McCarthy"</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodNightAndGoodLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodNightAndGoodLuck">Good Night, and Good Luck.</a></em> was "too over-the-top". The film used actual archived footage of the real McCarthy.
</li><li> When it was released in 1997 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> was very easy to mistake as a genuine attempt at making an ultra-patriotic action movie that turned out rather poorly. A decade later its actual nature as a pure and unrestrained satire became painfully obvious as the entire plot of the movie turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">frighteningly prophetic</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1of1c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1of1c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1of1c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When a hopelessly outclassed enemy did attack a major American city with a very low-tech but devastating surprise attack, the reaction turned out almost identical to the movie, including all the delusional mistakes and propaganda.</span> Meanwhile, the director of the film in question (who wasn't American and had an entirely different cultural background) still nods politely at interviewers who "discover" the parody in the movie. It is fairly certain that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulVerhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a> knew full well what he's been shooting, considering the movie itself has a number of straight visual quotes from Nazi propaganda and newsreels from both sides of the war, and arguably recreates a typical, infectious Soviet cinema plot about "new country" builders coming from Komsomol youth, overcoming their personal shortcomings (not only ideological, but emotional and professional) in the battle for the bright future of mankind. It helps that the screenwriter of the film is E. Neumeier, the author of equally snarky and incisive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987">RoboCop (1987)</a></em> (which Verhoeven also directed).
<ul><li> This is in direct contrast with the original novel by Robert Heinlein, who was completely serious about the political messages of the story.

The main character starts out as a decent person, but after being convinced to give up rock music, becomes a raving judgmental maniac.
</li><li> James Nguyen claims his film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic">Birdemic</a></em> is a masterpiece, despite the poor editing and writing, among other flaws.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> was actually an adaptation of a serious airplane disaster movie called <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hour!_(1957_film)">Zero Hour!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. While obviously a lot of jokes were added, most of the script - Ted and Elaine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">Glurge</a> filled romance, the goofy premise, the fish poisoning, the sick little kid - is lifted straight from <em>Zero Hour!</em>, where it was all played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">completely unironically</a>. It's actually kind of fun to watch the two back to back and see how little was changed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em> is a comedic adaptation of <em>Red Alert</em>, a book that played the same premise totally straight. Other than the ending and the inclusion of Dr. Strangelove himself, the story is almost slavishly accurate to the book. Notable because Peter George, the author of <em>Red Alert</em>, actually helped write <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, making it seem like even he realized how easily his book could slide into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> territory.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JosieAndThePussycats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JosieAndThePussycats">Josie and the Pussycats</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> was parodied by way of cranking it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptoEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptoEleven">Upto Eleven</a> even though the movie did not make any money off the products and the entire plot of the movie was parodying how media is used to sell products. However, about half the audience and critics got it as self-referential satire, while the other half just thought it had way too many product placements.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale">A Knight's Tale</a></em> was released, some movie critics somehow mistook it for a genuine Middle Ages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a> and castigated the movie for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>. The movie is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> and deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a> of sports stories only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">in the Middle Ages with knights</a>, so any historical errors were entirely intentional. The filmmakers joke about this on the DVD commentary, remarking that you'd think they'd have gotten the hint when the movie literally opens with medieval peasants singing "We Will Rock You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForkliftDriverKlaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForkliftDriverKlaus">Forklift Driver Klaus</a></em>, a German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyHilarious">Bloody Hilarious</a> parody of workplace safety films, is frequently linked by Anglophones with "look at those crazy Germans" comments suggesting that it's been mistaken for a serious workplace safety film.
</li><li> Two movies: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JesusBro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JesusBro">Jesus, Bro!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetThereBeLight2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetThereBeLight2017">Let There Be Light</a></em>.

This causes them to go through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">Easy Evangelism</a> where they lose the respect of their original community, end up getting advice from other Christians, and reconciles with old flings. Now heres the key; one is a satire on Christian propaganda films, while the other <em>is</em> a Christian propaganda film. If you decide to watch both films back-to-back, it'll be hard to tell the difference.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> includes the female droid L3-37, who is obsessed with "droid rights."

Most interpretations read it as a satire of British attitudes towards the working-class of Ireland. It created a scandal because some people didn't get the joke (Swift intended a scandal, but not like that). Modern readers who take it seriously justify their stance with Swift's misanthropy and deteriorating mental condition later in his life. At the time of the writing, however, he had no such attitudes or problems.

The poem caused public commotion in the time, because he wrote that the vices of the people can be useful to the society, but today is regarded as a serious economic tract and many economists complain that it's hard to interpret him. It's hard because Mandeville wrote it as a satire; he didn't have any pretension to make a scientific tract.

To his bafflement, their objection was on the assumption that he was saying the world <em>was</em> like this.

The book's article on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> explicitly calls it a comic portrayal, however, which is circumstantial evidence for the "it's a joke" interpretation, despite the author appearing serious in interviews, and despite him getting a sincere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">British</a> anarchist to write the preface.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> writer J.K. Rowling has had problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on the matter. You see, she made the mistake of giving a random extra in the first book the same family name as Harry Potter's very own mother. The boy in question was called Mark Evans. Once Harry's mother's name was revealed (this was before <em>The Half-Blood Prince</em> was released), fans began speculating that Mark would become very, very relevant to the plot, and asked Rowling if that was the case. Amused by how far the rumor had gotten, she joked that he was indeed a major character and that he was, in fact, the mysterious Half-Blood Prince the upcoming book was named after. <em>Everybody took it dead seriously</em>, to the point that someone went and created a page for Mark Evans on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, when British satirical site The Daily Mash published an article claiming that the <em>Harry Potter</em> series took place entirely in Harry's head, someone on the Harry Potter Wiki took this seriously and edited accordingly.

It doesn't help that it started with the real claim that Anthony Goldstein is Jewish.
</li></ul></li><li> At least two of A.P. Herbert's <em>Misleading Cases in the Common Law</em> were reported elsewhere as real court cases. The most famous is "The Negotiable Cow", in which Albert Haddock writes a check to the Inland Revenue on the side of a cow. There was also "Is It a Free Country?" which shocked one American legal commentator who believed a British judge had actually said "It cannot be too clearly understood that this is <em>not</em> a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is."
</li><li> Frederick Crews wrote two satirical essays-<em>The Pooh Perplex</em> and <em>Postmodern Pooh</em>-mocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic">obsessive over-analyzing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Faux Symbolism</a> in literary circles by applying that same analysis-style to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> and playing it with a straight face.

</li><li> Plato's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Symposium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Symposium">Symposium</a></em> contains a sequence where the playwright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory">"Just So" Story</a> explaining his idea of what love is, about how everyone was once a four-legged four-armed intersex person, but the gods cut them in half for their egotism and they're now searching for their missing halves. It's not uncommon to find versions of this story on myth-focused websites as an example of an actual Greek creation story, as it doesn't seem that much more absurd (and many even consider it one of the first examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">One True Love</a>). In context, though, it's meant as a mockery of creation myths, between the absurd imagery and the fact that Aristophanes is drunk off his ass.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall">The Kids in the Hall</a></em> sketch "Kitty History" parodied many historical conspiracy theories. As seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Lvv1f5Qu4">in the comments of this upload<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, many people thought the sketch was seriously supporting those theories.
</li><li> After Gordon Ramsay's creative insults in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a></em>, a lot of people thought <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/PV3_UHG73oQ">the "Idiot Sandwich"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> line was from an actual show. It actually came from a parody of Hell's Kitchen called "Hell's Cafeteria", wherein two talk show hosts play the role of contestants.
</li><li> Various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndLaughShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndLaughShow">Point And Laugh Shows</a> (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow">Talk Shows</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a>) occasionally feature (dis)honored guests that are <em>so</em> over-the-top that no one in the audience can be certain whether they're for real, actors, or some combination thereof.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> had a large faction of fans claiming that the fourth series would actually have four episodes rather than just three, a theory that became increasingly popular in the fanbase after the third episode and apparent series finale aired. Many argued that the episode was so laughably implausible, answered so few questions, and featured so many bizarre events that it couldn't be real, and was intended to seem like an impossible and nonsensical story to clue in the audience, and therefore the fourth episode would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelusionConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelusionConclusion">explain it to all be some kind of dream or hoax or false reality</a> and provide a "proper" conclusion. A week later, that faction of the fanbase discovered that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AppleTreeYard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AppleTreeYard">Apple Tree Yard</a></em> (which replaced <em>Sherlock</em> in its timeslot) was a real show, and the episode was not, in fact, written poorly on purpose.
</li><li> Whenever a country sends an act to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> that's obviously intended as a parody of the kind of novelty songs that show up at the contest, they inevitably just transform into the exact kind of song they're trying to mock.
<ul><li> Three notable examples are the 2008 trio of Ireland's Dustin the Turkey with "Irlande Douze Points"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3lc8e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3lc8e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3lc8e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A song by Dustin, a puppet turkey on Irish children's television, lamenting Ireland's lack of recent success at the contest and begging for points to a techno beat</span>, Estonia's Kreisisradio with "Leto svet"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gil0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4gil0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gil0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A bizarre song by three Estonian comedians sung in pidgin Serbian, Finnish, and German as a parody of countries singing in random languages to score points. One bit, involving two of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">humping a piano</a>, was supposedly a metaphor for what these novelty acts do to music</span>, and Spain's Rodolfo Chikilacuatre with "Baile el Chiki-Chiki."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5sbnw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5sbnw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5sbnw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A parody of dance crazes performed by a Spanish comedian purposefully intending to create, in his own words, "the most ridiculous song it is possible to play." The performance played up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> to the nth degree, particularly by having one of the female backing dancers being out-of-step and falling over trying to keep up with the rest</span> While all were deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>, when they were put in the same context as actual wacky Eurovision acts with more earnest intents (such as France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Latvia the same year), they just fell into the same traps and are often treated the same way, making appearances on "Worst Eurovision Songs" lists and usually being ranked as the worst of their year by fans, regardless of whether or not they know they're satirical.
</li><li> 2006 saw two similar acts, Iceland's Silvia Night with "Congratulations"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6ujow');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6ujow" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6ujow');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Silvia being a creation of an Icelandic comedian and musician mocking vain celebrities, with a purposefully over-the-top stage show and braggadocios lyrics proclaiming she was obviously going to win</span> and Lithuania's LT United with "We Are the Winners" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note79hqo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note79hqo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note79hqo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A group, mostly made up of local news and sportscasters as opposed to musicians, proudly declaring that they were the winners of Eurovision and that people should vote for them, styled after a football chant</span>. Both acts were greeted with loud jeers following their performances in the semi-final round, as fans took their attitudes at face value. It backfired for Iceland, since the song wasn't funny enough to escape Silvia's annoyingness (topped off with her actress staying in character the whole time, to the point of yelling at the Greek stage crew) and they didn't qualify. However, the viewers at home caught on to Lithuania's gag quicker than the fans in the arena: not only did Lithuania secure their first-ever qualification (to the loud consternation of the crowd), they managed their best finish <em>to date</em>, taking sixth place in the grand final, with Ireland even awarding the song twelve points. Even Finland's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lordi">Lordi</a>, the eventual winners, sang the song's chorus when they entered the winner's press conference afterwards.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/EmhfdQlOiy0">"Text Me Merry Christmas"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightNoChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightNoChaser">Straight No Chaser</a> is either a sincere song about lovers texting each other at Christmas because they can't be together or a satire about how vapid people who text each other constantly on their phones instead of interacting in more human ways are. The lyrics never directly wink at the audience, but both of the singers are depicted as being alone on Christmas rather than being with family which would keep them apart, and there are a few lines which are difficult to stomach. Naturally, the audience is split between those who think it is satire, those who believe that it <em>must</em> be satire because the alternative is too depressing, and those who think that it is a sweet modern-day Christmas song about being apart at the holidays.
</li><li> "The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ylvis">Ylvis</a> was made by a pair of talk show hosts and was supposed to be a parody of runaway formulaic pop hits that became... a runaway formulaic pop hit.
</li><li> People taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt">Anal Cunt</a>'s songs literally. Or for that matter, anything fronted by Billy Milano (S.O.D. and M.O.D. most notably). Flame wars have been fought over whether songs like "Speak English or Die" are satire or serious.
</li><li> Sylvan Esso's "Radio" is satirizing what artists will do to get air play on radio or make click-bait videos, but the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/effZUjig794">music video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is itself a super-hyped up "sexy" video that without context of the song is exactly the kind of video the song is parodying, and hearing the song on a pop-radio station would be like reading a news article on a site known for fake news about how news articles are faked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith">Toby Keith</a>:
<ul><li> The song "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue." Is it a genuine (if a little overheated) expression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a>, or an ironic glorification of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a> (Flavor 2) mentality? It's really hard to tell. The song starts off sincere and heartfelt enough, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">the abrupt shift from "melancholy" to "kickass"</a> is bizarre enough to inspire at least a few self-aware chuckles. It gets even more confusing if you watch the music video, which backs up the lyrics with an intense montage of various U.S. military bombs, missiles, and fighter jets, looking almost like a Technicolor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em>. On balance: since most country songs don't feature so much violent or militaristic imagery, it's easy to see this as a spoof; however, the song's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a> and throat-grabbing finale make you <em>want</em> to take it at face value. So, all things being equal, it's all probably being played straight. According to Keith himself he originally wasn't going to record the song <em>at all</em>; it was intended to be used only in live shows for military personnel until he was talked into recording it when they loved it. So it's almost certainly dead straight, but the context changes it. Glorifying America's military wrath <em>to the military itself</em> isn't quite the same as just shouting it in the street (especially when one factors in the military's distinct penchant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>).
</li><li> There's also his more overtly satirical "American Ride" from 2009, which got him considerable heat from both the political right and left for its political barbs. But as several music critics and even Keith himself pointed out, the song pokes fun at <em>both</em> sides of the political spectrum. (It should also be noted that it's one of the only singles in his career that he did not write.)
</li></ul></li><li> In a combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> recorded the album <em>Thick As A Brick</em> as a deliberately over-the-top <em>parody</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">concept albums</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> genre, after the previous album <em>Aqualung</em> was mistakenly called a concept album by the music press. It is widely considered one of the best progressive rock albums ever made, by music fans and journalists likely unaware that the work was a parody. Bandleader Ian Anderson still gets remarks from fans about how much older the fictitious child prodigy poet (Gerald Bostock) depicted in the cover art and album credits who "wrote" the lyrics to the album must be now in the present day.
<ul><li> However, the follow-up album <em>A Passion Play</em> is apparently a straightforward example, despite having the same structure.
</li><li> Years later, Anderson also claimed that it was a parody of the concept albums by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a> however at the time <em>Thick as a Brick</em> was released, neither Yes nor ELP had even released one (Yes' would come two years later with "Tales From Topographic Oceans" and ELP would never release a concept album in their history) so it is quite possible that Anderson is being a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>. He would finally embrace the concept in June 2012 when he released "Thick as a Brick 2." Though ELP had the album <em>Tarkus</em> and King Crimson made <em>Lizard</em> (both of them having sidelong epics) and Yes and Genesis had a penchant for long songs since the beginning. Maybe the success of <em>Thick as a Brick</em> helped bring it out further into the mainstream, essentially encouraging the trend of concept albums.
</li></ul></li><li> Biz Markie's "Just a Friend" made two VH-1 Top 100 lists and was praised for its "sincerity" even though Biz is not only a rapper but also a comedian, and the song's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> is played for humor.
</li><li> Jimmy Cross' "I Want My Baby Back" was meant to be a mockery of those morbid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageDeathSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageDeathSongs">Teenage Death Songs</a> from the '50s and '60s, but was voted one of the worst songs of all time by listeners who didn't realize this and mistook it for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">dead</a>-serious necrophiliac love ballad.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheRapCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheRapCritic">The Rap Critic</a> states this as the problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Kesha</a>: She's supposedly a parody of current music, but when "serious" artists are making songs that are just as ridiculous, it's hard to tell.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>'s Zoo TV tour was intended to be an overt parody of mass media, but ironic content was so subtle that may fans believed their appreciation to be genuine. Their subsequent Pop Mart Tour upheld the theme of parody. This time, the target was consumer culture; and fans were just as baffled as they had been by Zoo TV.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a> claim that their "You Gotta Fight for your Right to Party" song is actually meant to mock party-goers and the whole 1980s party scene, but it's universally appreciated as a party song. This applies to much of <em>Licensed To Ill,</em> their debut album, in general; it was a frat boy classic at the time, but the band became pretty embarrassed about the content in later years. MCA openly denounced their previous treatment of women in their 1994 single "Sure Shot."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blur">Blur</a>'s "Song 2" was just a late-in-the-game parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">Grunge</a>, that the band threw together in the studio. It is one of the most beloved grunge songs ever released, and their breakthrough single in America.
</li><li> An entire <strong>genre</strong> of music, called <em>disco polo</em> was created in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a> as a parody of disco music in the 80s and remains popular to this day (especially at parties). Not many people get the joke anymore, but it doesn't stop millions of people around the world from enjoying it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s "Born in the USA" is a bitterly sarcastic song about an emotionally scarred Vietnam veteran who can't find work and is pissed at Uncle Sam for screwing him over. People who don't listen to anything beyond the chorus, however, assume that it's a patriotic song. More than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk">War Hawk</a> politician (most infamously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>) has tried to use it for their campaigning.
</li><li> One look at SongMeanings.net should give you a pretty good idea of how an over-the-top spoof can be mistaken for reality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a> song "Cool To Hate," for example, is very clearly meant to be a parody of over-the-top teen angst. Yet, many commenters take it at face value and interpret it as a literal "call to arms." Of course, whether or not <em>those</em> are real or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a> is another matter entirely...
<ul><li> Really, a lot of The Offspring's material is open to this. They write a lot of satirical songs, though without listening carefully to the lyrics, it can be hard to tell what's meant to be taken seriously and what isn't.
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the darker examples of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> started getting neo-Nazis at their shows after they wrote a sarcastic song entitled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">Kill the Poor</a>" (and another entitled "California über Alles"). They wrote the song "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" in response. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NapalmDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NapalmDeath">Napalm Death</a> later covered it for the same reason: because neo-Nazis and boneheads started appearing at their shows as well and they wanted them to know in no uncertain terms that they were not welcome.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a> did an over-the-top spoof of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSatanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSatanism">Hollywood Satanism</a> at the 2014 Grammy Awards. Unfortunately, many people missed the joke and assumed she was a real life satanist<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8y9vv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8y9vv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8y9vv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">nevermind that it's called "Hollywood Satanism" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">for a reason</a></span>. It probably didn't help that, around this same time, her "turbulent" relationship with her fundamentalist Christian parents was being extensively covered by the media.
</li><li> German "Neue Deutsche Welle" band Geier Sturzflug and their greatest hit "Bruttosozialprodukt". It was meant as a scathing critic of capitalist work ethos. Promptly it got played at a party convention of the CDU (who thought it was a hymn to capitalist work ethos).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liturgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liturgy">Liturgy</a> had always been a polarizing band, but by the time of the release of their third album <em>The Ark Work</em>, even the relatively positive reviews of the album said they couldn't tell if the album was intended completely seriously, or if the band were trolling their listeners.
</li><li> This trope can be inferred to be the main cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Psy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Psy">"Gangnam Style"</a> achieving the kind of popularity it received in the west. The song was written as a satire of the culture of affluence surrounding the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea, and the people who haplessly try to imitate it; its music video compounds this mockery by featuring Psy portraying a man pretending to be a part of the Gangnam lifestyle, among other things acting like a sandbox in a kid's playground is a luxurious beach and floundering around in another man's hot tub as if it were a private swimming pool. The infamous horse-riding dance, when put in this context, is also intended to be a jab at the association between being wealthy and owning many prized steeds. Once the video reached the west however, the low amount of Korean-speakers there and the lack of a good translation from the get-go caused most viewers to take the bizarre imagery at face-value, giving Gangnam Style a reputation as a wacky K-Pop video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas">The Black Eyed Peas</a> decided to parody the misogyny and materialism of modern crunk rap by putting out the most ridiculous song they could come up with: "My Humps". Of course, since it's still done in the same style as the genre it's parodying, most people didn't realize it was supposed to be a parody until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanisMorissette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanisMorissette">Alanis Morissette</a> covered it in <em>her</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">Signature Style</a> and the Peas showed their approval of it.
</li><li> Italian britpop/indie rock band Velvet wrote a song titled "Boyband", which gently mocked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy Band</a> phenomenon that was at the height of its popularity at the time (2001). The lyrics and videoclip made clear the satirical intent of the song, but most listeners took them seriously, and the song being more pop than rock didn't help. They never managed to disassociate themselves from the stigma of being "another vapid boy band" despite being active to this day and releasing several critically acclaimed albums. To the general public they're just a forgotten boy band buried among dozens of similar acts.
</li><li> The infamous Paul Is Dead conspiracy started as (probably drug-addled) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> by American college students, but most of the "clues" originated from a satirical student newspaper article by Fred LaBour (aka Too Slim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RidersInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RidersInTheSky">Riders In The Sky</a>) which soon spread like wildfire. Despite this though the theory won't die as long as there's nuts around though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> wrote "Short People" as a parody of bigotry, working on the assumption that the idea of somebody being consumed with hate for... well, short people would be so ridiculous that nobody could fail to get the joke. Cue a large amount of hostile criticism accusing him of cruelly mocking those lacking in height.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PCMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PCMusic">PC Music</a> is a complicated example. The label/art collective is infamous for its uniquely post-ironic, avant-garde, and 2000's commercial pop-era-inspired aesthetic with exaggeratedly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">borderline parodical music</a>, believed to make a comment on pop music, consumerism, and internet culture, but critics have a hard time deciding whether they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">an affectionate celebration</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody">a cynical deconstruction</a> of those concepts. The fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">most of its acts tend to be private or straight-up anonymous</a> and thus silent regarding the matter doesn't help to bring answers.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a></em> and its sister site <em>ClickHole</em> is the embodiment of this trope, their satirical articles often being mistaken for real ones, while real extremist articles are often suspected of being Onion articles.
<ul><li> An article called "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> Sparks Rise In Satanism Among Children", in which six year old girls claim that "Jesus died because he was weak and stupid", was copied into a furious chain letter and circulated about the web. Commentators noted that many of the article's more obviously parodic passages were excised from the letter, suggesting that the poster may not have believed it him/herself. Regardless, it worked, triggering a panicked reaction among fundamentalists, in spite of (or perhaps because of) it ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">J.K. Rowling praising Satan</a>. The very same article led to a concerned parent sending mail to <em>Reader's Digest</em>, criticizing them about interviewing Rowling. After a bit of back-and-forth, the reader mentioned reading about it on <em>The Onion</em> whereupon <em>Reader's Digest</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160806051105/http://robinabrahams.com/2010/04/01/april-fools/">pointed out that it's a humor paper, and Rowling is not really a Satan worshiper.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Their videos have also undergone this trope, one of the most infamous cases being the video "Martial Law Plans Revealed?" <a class="urllink" href="http://idle.slashdot.org/story/10/07/21/1529256/Onion-Story-Gets-Blown-Out-of-Proportion">taken seriously by some conspiracy sites.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The AV Club posted an article about how <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110217071044/http://www.avclub.com:80/articles/glenn-beck-restores-honor-to-spiderman-turn-off-th%2C50001/">Glenn Beck loved the Spider-Man musical<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GlennBeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/GlennBeck">Glenn Beck</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark">Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</a></em> are polarizing topics which often spark fierce discussions, a lot of people thought this was just <em>The Onion</em> making stuff up, even though the AV Club is the non-satire section. It's not a joke; he really did enjoy the musical.
</li><li> The blog <a class="urllink" href="http://literallyunbelievable.org/">Literally Unbelievable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> chronicles people taking <em>Onion</em> and <em>ClickHole</em> articles at face value and posting about them on Facebook. It is as hilariously depressing as it sounds. Poe's Law applies recursively here, as it's impossible to tell whether the Facebookers are just playing along with the joke.
</li><li> The most controversial <em>Onion</em> example is their "Kelly" political cartoons, which still have people arguing about whether they're expressing or parodying conservative ideas. Although the real focus of the cartoons is less ideological than parodying the artistic cliches of bad, lazy political cartoons independent of any specific viewpoint.
</li><li> A high-profile victim of <em>The Onion</em> is US Congressman John Fleming (R-LA), who posted a link to the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex,20476/">"Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex" story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/02/congressman-falls-months-old-onion-story-about-planned-parenthood-abortionplex/48344/">on his Facebook page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Iran's FARS news agency fell for an Onion article that said more Americans would prefer Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be president than Obama. This is somewhat understandable from a country that believes Hollywood is controlled by Washington.
</li><li> China's <em>People's Daily Online</em> reported as straight news the <em>Onion</em> story declaring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un the "sexiest man alive for 2012."
</li><li> The British newspaper <em>The Independent</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/content/indy-voices-falls-onions-fake-miley-cyrus-editorial">printed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a "CNN statement" on their saturation coverage of a "shocking" dance routine by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> that was actually a satirical <em>Onion</em> column speculating on their motivation.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/42-million-dead-in-bloodiest-black-friday-weekend,30517/">42 Million Dead In Bloodiest Black Friday On Record<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Given that such a massive death toll would easily dwarf not only 9/11 but all US wartime deaths combined, and would result in a significant change in our way of life, one would think that no one could believe such a ridiculous story. Cue readers e-mailing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> and other sites, wondering if this story was true. It raises the question, which was an example of this trope, the original article, or the people wondering if it was true?
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate">FIFAgate</a> happened, one of the fourteen FIFA executives indicted tried to reject those charges and claimed they were part of a U.S. conspiracy against FIFA. How? By citing an <em>Onion</em> article headlined "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.theonion.com/article/fifa-frantically-announces-2015-summer-world-cup-u-50525">FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup In United States<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
</li></ul></li><li> While <em>The Onion</em> is perhaps the most famous satire newspaper on this list, other satire newsletters and satire news sites like <em>The Daily Currant</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WeeklyWorldNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WeeklyWorldNews">Weekly World News</a></em> can also fall victim to this. One famous example from the <em>Daily Currant</em> happened when marijuana was legalized in Colorado on January 1, 2014. They published a story titled "<a class="urllink" href="http://dailycurrant.com/2014/01/02/marijuana-overdoses-kill-37-in-colorado-on-first-day-of-legalization/">Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which naturally got well circulated on social media and elsewhere. Apparently, it was so convincing that Annapolis, Maryland Police Chief Michael Pristoop <a class="urllink" href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/25/citing-joke-annapolis-police-chief-testi">cited it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://rt.com/usa/marijuana-legal-maryland-satire-927/">when testifying in front of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about the legalization, having overlooked the three clues that it was a satire:
<ul><li> The article was published in 2014, but it cited <em>The Rocky Mountain News</em> as a source, which went out of business in February 2009.
</li><li> The article also cites an interview with a Dr. Jack Shepard. That's the name of a character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST">Lost</a></em>.
</li><li> One of the supposed 37 victims was a guy named Jesse Bruce Pinkman. Jesse Pinkman is the supporting lead on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> has numerous examples of rumors that were sparked by articles from these and more.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/borowitzreport">The Borowitz Report<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a satirical news blog hosted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheNewYorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheNewYorker">The New Yorker</a>'s</em> web site, which frequently confuses people (especially their right-wing US satire).
</li><li> <em>The Mirror</em> released an article in 2011 listing <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/why-one-direction-are-better-than-the-beatles-156810">ten reasons why One Direction was better than the Beatles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Several months later the same writer wrote an article titled "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/one-direction-better-than-the-beatles-column-846895">Hey dude, get a sense of humour:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> How I got death threats for joking that One Direction are better than The Beatles"
</li><li> Syndicated columnist Jack Kilpatrick once wrote a column purporting to be an interview with an ACLU leader named Eton "Si" Eritas. Eritas claimed he was determined to remove all traces of religion from America, going so far as to change the names of any cities with religious connotations, such as San Francisco and St. Paul. This column shocked many people and sparked countless columns and letters to the editor flaming the ACLU. The only problem? Eritas didn't exist. Eton "Si" Eritas, spelled backwards, is "Note: Is Satire."
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PrivateEye">Private Eye</a></em> ran a mock-up <em>Daily Telegraph</em> cover, parodying the MP Expenses Scandal the paper broke by targeting its proprietors, the reclusive Barcley Brothers, they received a letter threatening them with libel action. Their response was that it was in the "joke" section of the magazine, it clearly wasn't a real news story, and they didn't think there was a case to answer.
<ul><li> <em>Private Eye</em> gets this from many newcomers who don't know where the cut-off points between the 'investigative journalism' pages and the 'parody' pages are. There are a lot of otherwise intelligent people who think <em>From the Message Boards</em> (a parody of Internet arguments which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternetToughGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternetToughGuy">contains</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emoticon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emoticon">everything</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">you'd</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">encounter</a> in a real Internet debate) is genuine.

</div></li><li> Right-wing British paper "The Daily Mail" printed an article about a study which demonstrated that, on average, <em>right-wing voters are less intelligent and more racist</em> than left-wing voters. While many chose to believe that the article was satire (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">as no paper would be stupid enough to flat out insult their readers</a>), a number of upset readers were very upset by the article, which prompted Guardian writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker">Charlie Brooker</a> to deconstruct it.
<div class="indent">In what has to be a deliberate act of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a>", last Friday it carried a story headlined <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/05/daily-mail-calls-rightwingers-stupid">"Rightwingers are less intelligent than left wingers, says study"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In terms of enraging your core readership, this is the equivalent of Nuts magazine suddenly claiming only gay men masturbate to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></em> babes.
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd>Many people mocked the intelligence of those who believed that the article was real, believing that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCleverByHalf">clever enough to see that it was satire</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">They were wrong</a>.

As was noted by the study, it is not that being conservative makes you stupid and racist, but that people who are stupid and racist are more likely to become conservative. This does <em>not</em> mean that those on the left are necessarily smart and unprejudiced, as the effect is relatively small and there are plenty of stupid people to go around. The authors of the study noted it may also be an artifact of <em>extremist</em> views appealing to the stupid, with extremist views being more often associated with the right than the left in the US and UK.

</li><li> Douglas G. McGrath had a regular humor column in <em>The Nation</em> which was supposed to be the fictionalized diary of a high-ranking bureaucrat in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a> White House. In one column, he had then-Vice President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DanQuayle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DanQuayle">Dan Quayle</a> giving a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars where he said, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The Civil War</a> was the best war we ever had because when you're fighting with yourself you're always going to win." In Paul Slansky and Steve Radlauer's 1992 book <em>Dan Quayle: Airhead Apparent,</em> he claimed that the newsletter <em>The Quayle Quarterly,</em> dedicated to his mistakes, had contacted him because people had been contacting <em>them</em> to find out if the quote was real or not. McGrath said that if you were to put that fake quote on a page of real Quayle quotes, "you wouldn't even blink. It's the most interesting thing I know about Quayle: you can make up any quote, the more ridiculous the better, and it'll sound real." In other words, Quayle, much like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

The way the news was written was so realistic that a large number of Spanish-speaking sites and even radio programs had echoed it as something real.

</li><li> A lurid story alleging that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had executed his uncle by having him eaten alive by dogs was printed as potentially true by many English-language news outlets but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/06/story-kim-jong-un-uncle-fed-dogs-made-up">turned out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to derive from a Chinese-language comedy blog.

"It is tempting to decry frustrating restrictions on academic research as violations of academic freedom. Yet I would encourage student and worker organizers to instead use a framework of justice. After all, if we give up our obsessive reliance on the doctrine of academic freedom, we can consider more thoughtfully what is just." The almost entirely negative responses in the comments include numerous accusations that the author is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll</a> or a satirist, with one guy saying "Was this cross-posted on <em>The Onion?</em>" while another person says "There's something grimly admirable about an article that manages to be its own parody."

</li><li> Since the end of 2013, there has been a lot of debate in the Netherlands regarding the jolly helpers of their depiction of Saint Nicholas, since these helpers <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vrijalmelo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/intocht_zwarte_pieten.jpg">look like a toned down blackface<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. In early September 2014, the manufacturers of Playmobil dropped the production of figures that depict this helper. In response to this, a newspaper columnist proceeded to write a faux news article claiming that some people managed to ban a chocolate spread from a Dutch supermarket chain because they found it to symbolize Apartheid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">by having brown and white spread divided in 6ths in one jar, rather than being one uniform blend.</a> The article states that the fictitious protesters argued that the higher ups of the store chain "wouldn't argue that it was a harmless kids spread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">if Hitler would have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">had it on his sandwiches</a>" and were actually taken seriously.

While the website has a disclaimer (in small print) saying "All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney", many of Obama's detractors cited it as legitimate news.

In order to work people have to mistake the real ideology for the negative exaggeration.
</li><li> Radio host Phil Hendrie makes a <em>living</em> on this trope. His radio show consists of a stable of guests that he regularly interviews (the president of a home-owners association, the owner of a restaurant that supposedly sponsors the show, the head of a local activist group, etc.) discussing a current event of some sort, with the guest having some wild, ridiculous, and sometimes offensive opinion on the matter. This prompts listeners to call the show and incredulously berate the guest, whose rhetoric becomes more and more ludicrous as the segment goes on. The joke? All of the guests are voiced by Hendrie, who essentially is having a conversation with himself using a phone handset in the studio.
<ul><li> Hendrie is <em>very very good</em> at doing two distinct voices, keeping them straight, and "interrupting" himself realistically, so those who tune in to the program in the middle without ever having heard of Hendrie before can be excused for not realizing he's performing both the host and guest parts. However, there's also a meta level to this; it's sometimes difficult to discern whether the callers actually believe the guests are real or whether they're just playing along (given Hendrie's vocal talents, it wouldn't be impossible that he plays some of the more ridiculous callers himself).

The responses to this news portrayed by the episode were deliberately silly (eg Jeremy Corbyn calling for "urgent negotiations" with the <em>missiles</em>), but after the episode aired, the continuity announcer reassured "the concerned woman who phoned" that Trump hadn't really started nuclear war.

It was believable enough that many were fooled into thinking it was the real "Shoe." A couple weeks (and a few more posts) later, he revealed himself to be a fake. Yet the joke succeeded enough that, a couple months later, the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a> printed a letter from the imposter in their "Login" section and responded by commending him for the prank.
</li><li> Every year, the April issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GameInformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GameInformer">Game Informer</a> prints several pages of "Game Infarcer", with PARODY clearly stated at the bottom of these pages, that include ludicrous articles and reviews. Without exception, the next month's issue's letters columns is always full of letters from either people who didn't get the joke, or who did and are playing along. It's impossible to tell the difference between the two.
</li><li> When the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> series got a spin-off game for the 3DS, a person decided to make a satirical <a class="urllink" href="https://www.change.org/p/all-pikmin-fans-around-the-globe-petition-for-nintendo-to-cancel-pikmin-3ds">change.org<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> petition about trying to get the game canceled, in response to legitimate petitions on the site over more hot topic games at the time. Despite the writer going out of his way to take potshots at how pathetic these kinds of petitions are and the people who make them, and while a major part of the fanbase instantly managed to peg it as a satire, <em>unfortunately</em>, there were still a few out there who thought the petition was legitimate, either raging over how stupid it was or legitimately signing it.
</li><li> While it certainly has moments of sincerity, it is hard to count the amount of people that think <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatofulBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatofulBoyfriend">Hatoful Boyfriend</a></em> is a dead serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtomeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtomeGame">Otome Game</a> and not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of them. Bonus points if it's used to show "how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">weird</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">Japan</a> is".
</li><li> The "Sanic" meme — a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">deliberately poor</a> drawing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> — is often mistaken for an actual piece of Sonic fanart, with a common misconception being that it was drawn by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em> creator Chris Chandler as a preteen. In reality, it originated from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo_gJwXxshQ">a parody art tutorial video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> titled "HOW 2 DRAW SANIC HEGEHOG". Plus, "Sanic" is depicted with blue arms, a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> of Chris-Chan. While you'll see a lot of genuine Sonic fanart that's of... <em>questionable</em> quality, the "Sanic" drawing was very much done for laughs. Apparently Sega loved it enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">a shirt with its design</a> made its way into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em>, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020">the movie</a>.
</li><li> A piece of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> fanart made the news when <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/team-fortress-2-poster-mistaken-for-us-propaganda-on-russian-state-television/">a Russian television program about American WWI propaganda mistook it as an actual American propaganda poster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Evidently the ones that picked it out didn't know a word of English, and if they did, the words "Join Team Demoman" eluded them. It's not just non-English speakers that didn't get the joke, as reportedly several inattentive history teachers also used that poster in their lectures.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> is very fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody">Self-Parody</a>, but it often falls into this because it is very hard to come up with a "parody" Servant that is more ridiculous than canon <em>Fate</em> characters that are meant to be taken completely seriously. For instance, Okita Souji is a character with an inexplicable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip">Historical Gender Flip</a>, a silly catchphrase, tons of fanservice, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign">Reused Character Design</a>, and is meant to be a joke, while Nero Claudius is a character with an inexplicable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalGenderFlip">Historical Gender Flip</a>, a silly catchphrase, tons of fanservice, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReusedCharacterDesign">Reused Character Design</a>, and is meant to be taken seriously - the only difference is where they originated (Souji from a parody side-manga, Nero from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra">a main-line game</a>).

The animation behind the videos was purposely kept bad, as was the voice acting. However the dialogue, grammatical errors, and storyline the videos were based on are all real and was done with the serious attempt to get them made into a movie. Aside from the few who know the story behind <em>The Light of Courage</em>, most people can't seem to figure out whether it's real or not. It was based on a horrible fanfic that its creator took completely seriously, then someone else created the parody by adding purposefully badly done animation and voice acting. Also the case for the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HalfLifeFullLifeConsequences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HalfLifeFullLifeConsequences">Half-Life: Full Life Consequences</a></em> video, though this one is more universally recognized as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic">Troll Fic</a>.

Ironically, it's also possible that this rumor is another example of this trope.

</li><li> The now-defunct website marryourdaughter.com was a website purporting to sell teenage girls (some as young as 13) to prospective husbands (provided they submitted a "suitable" proposal).

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://dailycurrant.com/2013/05/16/ann-coulter-walks-out-of-star-trek-claims-too-many-minorities/">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the satirical newspaper <em>The Daily Currant</em> claiming that Ann Coulter stormed out of a showing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em> yelling that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> had "too many minorities". At least half the comment section missed the joke, although a possible explanation is that after some of the stuff Coulter really <em>has</em> said, it's easy to believe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a></em> is fond of creating exaggerated parodies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> characters, particularly the captains. Two notable aspects are that Picard loathes children, and Janeway is an insane, capricious tyrant. Both of them managed to exceed his parody versions of them in the show; Picard when he praises Riker for letting a little girl die (rather than save her with his Q-granted powers), and Janeway when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">wipes all records of a crewmember</a> and bans the crew from ever speaking of her again (to resolve an issue with the Doctor's programming).
</li><li> After the public backlash against celebrities like the King of Spain and several other people who posted pictures of themselves posing with dead animals they killed on hunting trips, Jay Branscomb posted a picture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> posing with the sick Triceratops model from his film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>, adding the caption: "Disgraceful photo of recreational hunter happily posing next to a Triceratops he just slaughtered. Please share so the world can name and shame this despicable man". Despite the fact that dinosaurs have been extinct for over 65 million years, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2688463/Steven-Spielberg-Im-disappointed-Online-uproar-photo-famous-movie-director-posing-triceratops-just-slaughtered.html">many people took the post seriously<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

However due to the high quality of the film's presentation (it looks like something you'd see on primetime TV), some people didn't catch onto the joke, thinking that the creators were actually serious about making a full-length movie like this. Even Saban themselves mistook it as being serious and tried to have the movie taken down for copyright infringement (thankfully it was put back up later). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that this was the intention of the project, and the irony was how people <em>enjoyed</em> the entire thing genuinely.

Despite the fact that the article is clearly not serious (the claims are deliberately as over-the-top and absurd as possible) and meant as a parody, plenty of readers took it at face value and most comments around the Polish internet are along the lines of "man, the fundamentalist Christians who wrote this must be insane!"
</li><li> There is a loose group of German Web sites collectively known as "Die Redlichen" ("the upright ones"), who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

Such habits, as well as egregious individual posts such as somebody ranting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">he didn't need to get dirty with his wife for them to have children</a> make it rather obvious that these people are not being serious, but they will never admit it, so a few of them might just be actual kooks, and there is a rumor that a child protection group actually filed charges against one webmaster.
</li><li> In light of the controversy surrounding the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016">Ghostbusters (2016)</a></em> reboot, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostbusters/comments/4s829p/ok_so_obviously_the_reviews_arent_as_bad_as_we/">this Reddit post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from r/ghostbusters, where one user asks how to best "filter out" positive reviews of the movie, caught a lot of attention from the media (including outlets such as BBC.) It was widely circulated as proof of how misogynistic haters are seeking to censor all positive reviews of the movie. However, it was a sarcastic troll post, and even the user who posted it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4sduxx/ethics_list_of_writers_and_publications_that_were/d58qwqf">admitted as much<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (and mentioned he was dismayed by how many people took it seriously.)

In his commentary for the episode, Spoony revealed that his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome">Channel Awesome</a> producers subsequently assumed that the actual scene used the Queen original and that Spoony had found some crappy cover version and dubbed it over to make the scene look even worse, forcing him to clarify that the scene <em>did</em> use the cover.

He explains that he realized that they were so blatantly false compared to the episodes themselves that he's not entirely certain whether they're serious and lying or meant to spoof trailers of that nature.
</li><li> In 2017, a <a class="urllink" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/to-be-fair-you-have-to-have-a-very-high-iq-to-understand-rick-and-morty">Reddit comment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mocking the attitude of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> fans went viral, with a lot of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> taking it at face value, despite the obviously parodic intent of the comment.

The video was actually scripted and created as a satirical response to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">actual szechuan sauce protests</a> by the fandom that happened shortly before. Most people assumed the freak-out was real and became viral and continued to be used by the hatedom as a poster child for the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a>.

Unsurpsingly they were embarrassed after the public called them out on it and took it down without comment, although it also doesn't help that the article paints pot as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">"third world drug"</a>.
</li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Creamsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Creamsicle">Creamsicle</a> picture was a parody of the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLikeOtherGirls">Not Like Other Girls</a>.

It's so over the top that no one would believe it was real, right? Well, as a look at the comments will point out, many people took it seriously. On a plus side, the movie producers did get quite a bit of free publicity.
</li><li> The Bonsai Kitten web site, which admittedly was a very sick joke, was a joke nevertheless (close inspection of several of the photographs revealed that they were obviously posed, such as a kitten supposedly "in" a bottle being actually behind it). Still, the site drew tons of protests, including several chain letters, from those who failed to grasp the parody.
<ul><li> Even for those who accept it's parody, the argument goes that those who take it for real might try and do that to actual kittens.
</li></ul></li><li> The ManBeef web site garnered similar reaction. The joke was the site claimed to sell human meat and provide recipes for cooking human meat. The site had nowhere to actually begin human meat transactions, just in case someone was crazy enough to try (and there were a few).

Many were confused as to whether the videos were serious or not, but in this case the fact that it was believable as a Tea Party position <em>was</em> part of the point of the parody.

Comments against the blog consist of trolls trying to outdo each other, although including the occasional poster who is not in on the joke and would seem to believe it to be real.

It produces randomly generated rants formed from careful analysis of the HYS comments, and the results are not unlike the "From the messages boards" section in Private Eye: often sadly indistinguishable from the real thing. The source database has sadly not been kept up to date.

</li><li> Conservative former Virginia state senator Steve Martin (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin">that one</a>) made a Facebook post in which opposed abortion, calling it wrong even if "the child's host (some refer to them as mothers) wants to kill it". This caused outrage for apparently dehumanizing pregnant women as mere "hosts" rather than human beings in their own right. His actual intention was to sarcastically use the same language that a few pro-choicers have used, whereby an embryo/fetus should be considered a parasite and the mother the host. But this line of pro-choice argument is sufficiently obscure, and Martin's wording sufficiently awkward (the tone switches mid-sentence from "what I really believe" to "what the other side believes"), that it came across differently.
</li><li> This regularly happens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Internet memes</a>, particularly anything based around parody of a certain subculture. For instance, "le monkey face" was originally created as a parody of derivative and formulaic "rage comics," but it didn't take long for it to be unironically adopted. And then there's the phenomenon of MLG montages, which were designed to mock overproduced and obnoxious gameplay videos, but quickly developed a fanbase of people who viewed it as simply being the same as those videos, but with more of the stuff they liked (namely, lots of editing and effects combined with loud and unpleasant music).
<ul><li> Another example is Kekistan, <a class="urllink" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kekistan">originally created to mock identity politics.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Later on, it became a legitimate symbol of the alt-right, which is just the other side of the identity politics coin.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a Twitter account belonging to Steven Smith, Tea Party member and Representative of Georgia's 15th Congressional district, who's been known for making outlandish remarks such as calling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

That hasn't stopped people up to and including Senator Claire McCaskill from believing that he's real and completely serious; when called on it, most people who fall for it claim some variant of this trope, saying it's impossible to tell facetious versions of conservatives from the real thing.

On his Tumblr he states to be half-serious and half-parody, for what it's worth.
</li><li> After a French police dog was killed in a raid on a terrorist safehouse in Paris, believed to be linked to the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in the city, a Twitter user with the handle SupaSchweppes <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-34861540">created the hashtag #jesuischien<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("#iamdog") as a parody of sentimental hashtag slacktivism in response to terrorism.

</li><li> In a review for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge">Jaws: The Revenge</a></em>, the reviewer at <a class="urllink" href="http://jabootu.net/?p=589">Jabootu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> wrote that "Apparently the studio wanted the ending changed, but wasnt willing to authorize more than $75 to film the new sequence," in reference to the fact that the film's original ending was reshot to show the shark suddenly exploding for no reason after being impaled. The fact that the shark's new death scene was put together with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">a toy shark and a crude wooden boat</a> led to many people taking this literally and assuming for years that $75 <em>really was</em> how much the studio had been willing to shell out for the new ending. It wasn't until others clarified that the new ending also included an extra scene with the four lead actors (the cost of hiring whom would have been <em>way</em> in excess of $75) that this myth got dispelled.

Japanese commenters noted that no such ad ever aired in Japan, but applauded Mike for his efforts anyway.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> user named Tamtampamela had a channel on which she posed as a satire of fundamentalist Christians, but when she put up a video thanking God for the Japanese earthquake, saying that he had caused it to punish Japan's atheist population, it immediately went viral and she started receiving death threats, causing her to eventually come clean that it was a parody.
</li><li> Just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> user potholer54 was about to nominate a creationist for his 2008 Golden Crocoduck Award (given to the creationists who knowingly and most effectively lied to support their arguments), the creationist outed himself as a satirist.

</li><li> Several videos, such as the famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryGermanKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryGermanKid">Angry German Kid</a>" video were originally made to <em>satirize</em> how German politicians saw gamers. Unfortunately, if you ask around today, most people won't actually know it's faked because of how easy it is to put on a show for the camera.
</li><li> Another famous video, the Greatest Freakout Ever: At least 3/5 of the comments were "Boy, this is what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> does to people?!?", ignoring that you can replace "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>" with "Xbox Live" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a>" and it'd <em>still</em> make sense... or that. The internet still seems to be divided between those who think it was fake and those who think it was real, without any conclusive proof one way or the other.

The video ended up being posted to reddit's r/cringe subreddit, where commenters had a hard time telling whether he genuinely wanted to kill people or was just a massive troll.
</li><li> YouTube user 1stkirbyever ran into this while simultaneously <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/bLb25V5lqaE">demonstrating a glitch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> demo and parodying Sonic's infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a>.

</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CausticCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CausticCritic">Caustic Critic</a> boom of 2007, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">everyone with a camcorder was jumping on the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryVideoGameNerd">Angry Video Game Nerd</a></em> bandwagon, one particular user named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Armake21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Armake21">Armake21</a> chimed in. According to himself he was supposed to be riffing on reviewers who wanted to be the AVGN but had no idea how to write jokes beyond "swear at the TV". In terms of viewership, he was moderately successful. In terms of the parody... not so much: after a review of <em>Shinobi</em> for the NES he had to post a follow-up video demonstrating his previously-poor skill was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>.

The video consists of a real Arabic newscast with phony subtitles. President Obama's detractors quickly took the video as fact and posted it on several conservative blogs, until the poster, — who admits to being conservative but quotes the Trope Name directly (as shown) — cleared it up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/McJuggerNuggets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/McJuggerNuggets">McJuggerNuggets</a></em> falls into this a lot — one of the major questions fans and haters have is "Is this real or not?". The depiction of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">dysfunctional family</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">an abuser losing people to dominate and becoming less rational as time goes on</a>, multiple abusive relationships, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">nobody thinking to help</a> (especially not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">police</a>), as well as the fact that the main character Jesse regularly moves back to a house where he's clearly abused brings up a <em>lot</em> of people to suspect both.
<ul><li> After uploading a video of Jesse shooting his father dead, and a follow-up video showing him moving out of the country in a desperate attempt to escape his crime, he cries on camera admitting that he made a mistake that can never be forgiven. Immediately after he finishes, he gets up, walks out of the room, and points the camera at the door, showing that his dad is alive and well, his mom is nearby, and he is in his parents bedroom and <em>not</em> a hotel room like the video leads you to believe. Following this, Jesse came forth admitting that the entire Psycho series was indeed totally fake, and proceeded to upload bloopers and discussions about the show, even showing him giving his parents multi-thousand dollar checks for their help in the series. Jesse would also admit that, due to the lines of the show blurring from reality, he had actually been swatted before, and had the police called on his home multiple times by concerned or enraged fans. At one point, the police had even told him that he had to stop uploading the videos, which he responded that the show was nearing completion shortly. He continues uploading as he has before with new videos and series.

Crowder claims it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing">intentionally bad</a> to lampoon a wave of bad impression videos going around on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> at that time, but most commenters didn't get the joke.

The description implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">this was a serious attempt at bringing religion to the youth</a>, and at a glance one might believe it, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9u4nCnZn8">in-depth research<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows that the video is definitely satire. One of the main clues (ironically not mentioned in the analysis video) is that the word "swag" is used as a synonym for "coolness" in the song's lyrics, even though that particular meaning didn't exist when the video was supposedly made. The church shown at the start of the video shows no trace of ever existing, and its website only has one message, claiming the church shut its doors in 2004, even though the site's domain was registered in 2013 (around the same time as the creation of the account that uploaded the video). Also, trying to find even the tiniest scrap of information about Pastor Jim Colerick or Mary-Sue Colerick (the name of the pastor and his wife given at the start of the video) from Iowa is impossible, meaning the performers were using fake names.

Despite this, she was still given the rights to Timmy's fairies half the time. It was later revealed that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">perfect to a fault</a> as she often tried so hard to make everything great that she ended up overcompensating and ruining everything instead which led to people ostracizing her. Unfortunately, her sue qualities got played so straight that many people in the show's fandom mistook her for an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue">Canon Sue</a> and decried her inclusion and how she able to get fairies despite being "perfect".

The phrase, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">This is what Scientologists actually believe</a>" was put in because it would've been indistinguishable from the show's weird humor to those who didn't already know the story. Even then, some people <strong>still</strong> didn't believe it, because even that sounds like something <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> would do.

But a lot of reviews didn't even notice those elements, because we're talking about a show that once depicted Barbara Streisand as Mechagodzilla; ridiculous exaggeration to make a comedic point and incredibly simplistic and blatant messaging is pretty much <em>South Park</em>'s stock-in-trade.

Fortunately, when the episode actually aired, it quickly became clear that the rap was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">intentionally ridiculous</a>, as it was a <em>parody</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> edutainment from the 90's.

However, some fans mistook the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> for actual bad writing, even thinking the show was finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">Jumping the Shark</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> was worried that fans would react that way.

<ul><li> This wasn't the first episode that gave some of the Springfield recurring characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>; the previous season had the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2122ShortFilmsAboutSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2122ShortFilmsAboutSpringfield">22 Short Films About Springfield</a>" episode, which also served as the pilot for a potential spinoff titled "Tales of Springfield", albeit that one had the series' usual tone and none of the (intentional) bad writing this episode had.
</li><li> Second, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">many of the younger viewers had no idea the shorts were meant to be a parody of existing shows</a>, since, at least in the second and third short's case, were based on decades old works that had very short runs (for a good reason) and thus were pretty obscure. Lisa being replaced by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> teen in the third segment came as particularly baffling to some, not realizing something like that happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunchVarietyHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunchVarietyHour">The Brady Bunch Variety Hour</a></em>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali">Salvador Dalí</a> once sent a telegram for Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu, for his adoption of a scepter as part of his regalia. Dalí's intent was to mock him, but Ceauşescu, who had one of the biggest personality cults ever, took it seriously, and the text was published in the Party's newspaper. When he <em>did</em> find out it was a joke, he fired the editor who published it. Never mind that he was the one who ordered it to be published.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> went political and wrote a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/creationism-your-questions-answered">blog post<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> giving a statement of creationist beliefs, with the intention of making a point about people's inability to recognize irony. While many people did see the satire, a significant number of readers either thought he was being serious or assumed the site had been hacked. PZ Myers <a class="urllink" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/there_is_such_a_thing_as_bad_s.php">criticized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the article, pointing out that when there are so many people making the same claims without irony, the joke becomes undetectable to anyone who doesn't already know Ebert's stance on the issue.
</li><li> A little known example with Erwin Schrödinger. His infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat">Schrödinger's Cat</a> thought experiment was actually made by him as an absurd scenario to point out the flaw with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which claimed that two systems (such as two subatomic particles) which interacted but then separated would each have to be in a non-definite state until observed. Schrödinger thought this was silly and so came up with a scenario so absurd that it would show the flaws in the Copenhagen interpretation. His scenario was that if you locked a cat in a box with a gas vial of poison that would be smashed upon the decay of a radioactive isotope, then left the box closed and unobserved for a half-life of the isotope, the isotope would be in a superposition of being (i.e. "both or neither") decayed and not decayed, the gas consequently in a superposition of being released and not released, and the cat in a superposition of being both alive and dead. Many laypeople today know Schrödinger's name only from this thought experiment, and assume that he believed (or perhaps even "proved") that quantum mechanics meant that you could have a cat simultaneously alive and dead, when in fact this was intended as an absurd implication of an interpretation of quantum mechanics that Schrödinger wished to discredit. Moreover, a few experiments have placed particles or quantum-scale systems in situations were they do genuinely appear to be in two states simultaneously.
</li><li> There were "scientific" papers and conferences that swallowed and processed nonsensical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeigningIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeigningIntelligence">but imitating their style and language</a> papers, only to discover they were punned:
<ul><li> <em>Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/">by Alan Sokal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Alan Sokal, a physicist who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience">severely annoyed</a> at scientifically-illiterate deconstructionist philosophers trying to work quantum physics into their philosophy, submitted a paper to the journal <em>Social Text</em> which declared "quantum gravity"—and ultimately reality itself—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">to be a social construct</a>, and that somehow this was beneficial for left-wing politics. <em>Social Text</em> accepted it. No peer review, no attempt to verify the scientific 'facts'. Right after printing it he notified them it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">logically inconsistent rambling</a> as bad as he could write without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">using mushrooms</a>. Oops. <em>Social Text</em> was annoyed. According to the journal editors, they didn't agree with his argument and thought the paper was badly written, but at no point had it occurred to them that it wasn't a sincere effort. Sokal concluded that they had printed his paper because it came from a respected academic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiasSteamroller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiasSteamroller">flattered their political views</a>.
</li><li> <em>WMSCI 2005</em> accepted an article <em>Rooter: A Methodology for the Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy</em>. The only value it has for computer science is the fact that this garbage wasn't even written by a human, but by a pseudorandom text generator. Then these pranksters went to the conference, held a "technical" session and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">read a few more randomly generated speeches</a> with straight faces. <a class="urllink" href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">It's all there<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — along with the Open Source text generator.

Igor and Grichka Bogdanov published their papers in reputable scientific journals claiming that their calculations could puzzle out what things were like in the Planck era (the point immediately after the Big Bang). Subsequent criticisms of the papers by scientists and in Internet forums claimed that the poorly-written papers, filled with many commonly used scientific buzzwords used in nonsensical contexts, were meant as a big hoax. The controversy is frequently called the "reverse Sokal hoax" because A) the material was submitted to scientific journals rather than liberal arts journals, and B) the Bogdanovs consistently maintained that they were completely sincere.

A giant scandal (and much lulz, depending on your stance) ensued.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1985 MIT pranksters managed to get a sculpture included in an exhibition at MIT's List Visual Art Center. Titled "No Knife", it consisted of an overturned wastebasket on which was a dining hall tray, plate, bowl, glass, fork and two spoons. It was accompanied by an artist's statement describing it as "a study in mixed media earth tones", and going on to praise and interpret it ("The casual formalism of the place setting draws upon our common internal instincts of existential persistence to unify us with the greater consciousness of human bondage") in a parody of the style of art criticism. It took the gallery staff several hours to discover it was not actually part of the exhibition.

Even though <em>The SCUM Manifesto</em> is generally taken at face value, Solanas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon">did claim that it was satire</a>, with academics such as Laura Winkiel arguing on her behalf. Those who know Solanas have given inconsistent accounts of whether or not she herself claims it to be satire.
</li><li> In a strange case, creationist speaker Kent Hovind earned the P.T. Barnum "One Born Every Minute" Award when he incorporated information of the finding of man and dinosaur fossils co-existing and the government cover-up of this discovery, from a website into his lectures as evidence against evolution. In reality, the website was a fake one (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.nmsr.org/Archive.html">and somewhat conspicuously so<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) that the New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) had set up as an April Fool's Day prank.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: Scenes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> over-the-top parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheClouds">The Clouds</a></em>, were cited in Socrates' trial as if they were real evidence against him. You know, the one that ended with him forced to drink hemlock?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> mocked the way her opponents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">obsess over minor misstatements of hers</a> by releasing a blog post consisting entirely of erroneous statements made by President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>. At least some of her detractors criticized the new "mistakes" from Mrs. Palin. Reimagined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">common knowledge</a> that Sarah Palin said, "I can see Russia from my house!" ... via Tina Fey's parody (the actual quote was that you can see Russia from a certain place in Alaska, which is true as far as it goes).
</li><li> There's a minor political party in Russia called "Communists of St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast" (CPLO), that is best known for their public appeals, written in an over-the-top style of mock Soviet propaganda. They sent a hate mail to Steven Spielberg over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em>, and accused <em>Avatar</em> of ripping off from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers">Strugatsky Brothers</a>. Recently, they claimed that European probe Philae is a 'space pirate' and should pay for landing on a 'Soviet' Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet. Their philippics have been picked up by media and taken too seriously, so that the <em>real</em> Communist Party had to remind they have nothing to do with that. There's still a debate is CPLO parodying Communists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun">Just For Fun</a>, as an advertisement strategy, or if they're really nuts (which is unlikely).
</li><li> As a satire of excessive capitalism, an artist made a bench that you must pay to sit on; overstay your purchased welcome and the bench will <em>impale you with steel spikes</em>. And now, a Chinese park owner who didn't get the joke <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/838228-retractable-spikes-installed-on-park-benches-to-deter-lazy-bums">actually wants to install these in his park<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to prevent hobos from hanging around on the benches.
</li><li> At the First West Coast Computer Faire, Apple engineer Steve Wozniak had made several gag brochures for a successor to the MITS Altair called the "Zaltair." The ad copy was filled with absurd claims, like having 18 expansion card slots, a new "BAZIC" programming language that could be rewritten by the user, and a case that will "add to the decor of any living room." People bombarded the MITS stand with questions about the new model, and it wasn't until late in the day that anyone caught on to the joke. Today, these brochures are highly sought-after collector's items. What made it plausible was Woz's unorthodox sense of humor and that everything listed there <em>did</em> really exist at that time  the fictional computer just had little to do with those features. Except maybe 18 expansion slots  this was how many slots were in the full-feature <em>Altair 8800</em> MB, though not all of them could be used for expansion.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12fuog');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12fuog" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12fuog');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">MITS' S-100 bus was a passive backplane, and at least three to four slots were taken up by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CentralProcessingUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CentralProcessingUnit">CPU</a> board, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RandomAccessMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RandomAccessMemory">memory</a> board, I/O board etc.</span> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProgrammingLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProgrammingLanguage">Programming Language</a> that could be rewritten on-the-fly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13knlr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13knlr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13knlr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">John McCarthy's Lisp</span> was actually invented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheythink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheythink">back in '55</a>, but was virtually unknown in the microcomputer world, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">case might be successfully built</a> that the case that will "add to the decor of any living room" was present in Woz's own work  the fair was a venue where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleII">Apple ][</a> was first unveiled, and it was the first fruit of Steve Jobs' famous "computer as appliance" philosophy.
</li><li> In many retail stores, thinking you'll be funny by making a ridiculous statement, unreasonable demand, or just acting stupid will almost always elicit an entirely serious response from cashiers and customer service associates ("Can someone help me carry this carton of eggs to my cart?" "Can I pay in monopoly money?" "I'd like to speak with the CEO of this franchise."). Odds are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">if they've been there awhile, someone has probably already asked or demanded something far, far crazier and were utterly serious about it.</a>
</li><li> After years of secrecy English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CropCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CropCircles">crop circle</a> makers Doug Bower and Dave Chorley decided to fess up to their pranks in 1991, only to find many UFO-believers deciding that although the circles were man-made, the two must have been possessed by aliens who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">made the circles through them</a>. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Skeptoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Skeptoid">Skeptoid</a> sums up in an episode on crop circles:
<div class="indent">''It is an interesting world we live in, where you can tell a group of people that you made a crop circle with a rope, even show them how you did it, and they still insist that an unknown paranormal intelligence did it. Many of the people making these claims had built a cottage industry out of talking and writing about the circles, and their reputations and livelihoods were at stake.
</div></li><li> During a game in longtime New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter's final season (2014), the opposing Minnesota Twins featured a hilariously effusive "scouting report" graphic on their TV broadcast, which led to sportswriter Joe Posnanski <a class="urllink" href="http://joeposnanski.com/joeblogs/greatest-thing-ever/">musing on his blog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about how perfectly said graphic could work as satire.
</li><li> An "actual news that could be mistaken for satire" example, on Australia Day 2015, when Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot decided to have Prince Phillip of England made a Knight of the Order of Australia (knights and dames being something he re-introduced with much mockery from the general public and the media), <a class="urllink" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-27/benson-australia-day-a-tipping-point-for-abbott/6047686">media writers checking their sources was a common mention in comment articles that day<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Abbot's own ministers and the entire media went "WTF? <em>Seriously?!</em>", and First Dog on the Moon <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/27/its-over-its-now-impossible-to-satirise-tony-abbott">decided that Tony had pretty much transcended satire.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> 2017 saw a sudden explosion in "flat Earth" conspiracy theories. The problem is that while it had been smoldering away in the background for centuries, the sudden influx included so many parodists and people just along for the meme and there's no way to tell them apart from the genuine article. It's entirely possible that there are <em>no</em> genuine believers outside the same few religious fundamentalists that have always carried the torch. Indeed, fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, whose <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> fantasy novels are set on a flat world, have gleefully pitched in with tongue-in-cheek support for the Flat Earthers: a general attitude among Pratchett fans who are in on the joke is to criticize the Flat Earthers for not going far enough and for leaving out the necessary supporting infrastructure of elephants and world turtle necessary for the cosmos to work. Some of the best Pratchett-inspired "support" for Flat Earthism includes finely detailed arguments for the existence of elephants and turtle having been hushed up by NASA, and is indistinguishable from genuine flat-Earth advocacy.
</li><li> Roosh "The Douche" Vash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">published a satirical article advocating the decriminalization of sexual assault</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">inspired by A Modest Proposal.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">This got him banned from entering the United Kingdom</a> because people thought he <em>really was</em> advocating decriminalizing rape. However, to double dip this trope, the article was so unremarkable among his body of work (he was already famous as an anti-feminist and open rape apologist) that there's no way to tell if he really thought this was an obvious exaggeration or if it was a desperate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyRetcon">Parody Retcon</a>.
</li><li> The hysteria over the Large Hadron Collider theoretically being powerful enough to create micro-black holes <a class="urllink" href="https://www.inquisitr.com/1943961/satirical-newsite-sparks-cern-lhc-doomsday-fears-physicist-amit-goswami-warns-lhc-could-destroy-planet/">originated from a satirical article.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9qv8RSreIM&amp;t=">Trumpy Bear<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It is a teddy bear patterned after Donald Trump. It even has an American flag that unfurls from its back like a cape. The commercial itself plays like a parody straight out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>. However, shows like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">The Late Late Show</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/XHorfRgvLsI?t=104">here,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulw332DQ52M">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trumpy-bear">have shown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the product and the commercial are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gettrumpybear.com/">very, very real and sincere<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as were the patriotism and the testimonial from a Navy veteran.
</li><li> Similar to the flat Earth example, it's hard to tell how many people really believe in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Mandela Effect</a>, the belief that when you misremember something from the past, the "wrong" version you remember was actually true until reality changed somehow. Most of the posts on the Mandela Effect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">subreddit</a> feel like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a>, with people either pretending to be really dense (with obviously contrived misspellings of celebrity names, or thinking that well-known, very much alive celebrities really died years ago), or coming up with overly complex, nonsensical explanations of what might be causing the effect (Parallel universes colliding! Time travelers deliberately messing with things!), all seemingly to goof around with the small handful of posters who feel it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.
</li><li> Russian film-maker Anton Ilmyanov was disconcerted to see videos showing UFO's and putative "sky-beasts" living in Earth's upper atmosphere appearing on ufology websites as proof positive that not only UFO's but the fabled "sky beasts" existed. The reason for his dtsconcertment was simple: he had created the videos himself as educational exercises, demonstrating how ridiculously easy it is to fake these things with modern technology. Even though he had clearly labelled his work as deliberate fakes that should not be taken as real, and the whole point of making them had been to demonstrate how such things can be faked, they had still ended up with the UFO-nuts anyway. Even today they are still out there, with some commentators explaining that Ilmanyov has clearly been "got at" by Them and forced to denounce the films... see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes">Fortean Times</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FT329" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FT329">FT 329</a>, July 2015)
</li><li> Amid 2020's worldwide debate over systemic racism and removing monuments to historical figures who perpetuated bigotry, someone spray-painted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/USefulNotes/Denmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/USefulNotes/Denmark">Copenhagen's</a> landmark statue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a> with the words "RACIST FISH". Which is a bit confusing, since even the most nitpicky scholar would have trouble labeling either the story or the mermaid "racist". So, was it the work of sincere-but-misguided activists? Or drunk pranksters? Or people trying to satirize the whole statue debate by painting a nonsensical slogan on an innocent marker?
