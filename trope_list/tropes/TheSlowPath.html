</p><p>A sort of breakdown of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture">Meanwhile, in the Future</a>, The Slow Path is what a character travels down when they use time travel to experience much <em>more</em> time than the other characters in the story.
</p><p>This typically takes one of two forms: a character can use time travel to take a "time out" from the story at large, returning when they are good and ready (or simply manages to blunder their way back home). Alternatively, a character might be left behind by time travel, and therefore be forced to return to the present by "going the long way." If a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicle</a> or a longer-lived/immortal being is not involved, this can be particularly tragic, with the character forced to burn up a sizable chunk of their vital years. Or worse, they might have been sent far enough into the past that they won't survive the "return trip" at all.

Suddenly, the ship comes back. Zoe and Max wonder if he stopped his journey or was gone for a long time just to return to the day he left.

</li></ul></li><li> In the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, Sailor Pluto dies in the "future" to save Chibiusa. She reveals herself to Chibiusa in the next arc in the present day, having explained she was reincarnated <em>backwards in time</em> to a point before Sailor Moon's adventures began. She laid low until after the Senshi went forward in time, saw her death, and returned. This also explains how the Time Gate still has a Guardian while Setsuna is with the rest of the Senshi. Presumably she'll wait until her previous self dies and then take over her old duties at the Time Gate.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>, the immortal elf Rayek kidnaps the family of Cutter, chief of the mortal Wolfriders, and takes them roughly ten thousand years into the future. His plan is to save the ancestors of the elves during their initial time travel mishap (which sent them back into the past). However, this would prevent the Wolfriders from ever existing. Cutter has no idea when his (immortal) lifemate Leetah and their (mortal) children will ever appear again, and he knows that he will die after roughly six thousand years. The first five centuries are torment for him and his tribe, and they eventually decide to have themselves wrapped in a time-freezing cocoon. The immortal characters (including the troll king, whose daughter was also kidnapped) live the years out, as do a select few Wolfriders who dislike tampering with nature and who simply choose to life a normal life. The plot resumes ten thousand years later, when Cutter's lifemate and children finally see him again — after what, for them, has only been a few hours. Later chapters show that Cutter's time without his family severely traumatized him — he could simply not stop <em>counting</em>.

In one future timeline, Cable accidentally jumps two years into the future but leaves Hope and Bishop behind.
</li><li> One arc sees the team accidentally deposited to the past, and stuck on the home planet of the Skrulls - just hours before Galactus was fated to destroy it. The team manages to escape, but they don't have any way to return to their present (and at the current moment in X-history in the time they were in, it would have been only shortly after both <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNewMutants">The New Mutants</a> were formed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> first joined the team).

One kills Leia and the stormtroopers, and another resurrects them — Leia just fine where and when she was, letting her escape... the stormtroopers <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/Marsh8472/starwars_timetravel.jpg">eight thousand years in the past<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

Through the arc, there are moments where it shows what everyone in Metropolis is doing, showing how little time is passing for them. By the time he finally returns home in the then-present day 1991, Lois remarks that just a couple hours have passed, while an exhausted Superman has been gone for nearly five months. This trope is also directly referenced at one point in the arc, when Superman is currently trapped in the 1940's and wonders if the only thing for him to do is take the slow path all the way back to the present.

Once they get back, the exact instant they left, the problem becomes far worse, as the monster is still there, and still at giant size, and without the Zords, they have no idea how to stop it. Until, that is, Zordon contacts them and tells them the Zords were built <em>to last</em>. Indeed, they're still where they left them, buried under several million years desert sand, and they still respond to their summons and work perfectly. They easily defeat the creature.

</li><li> The Time Turners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em> are only ever used in the story to take people <em>back</em> in time - first Hermione so she can take multiple classes simultaneously all year, then Hermione and Harry to rescue Buckbeak and Sirius. In all cases, they took the slow path back to the present (although it was only a matter of hours in each case).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTechnicolorTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTechnicolorTimeMachine">The Technicolor Time Machine</a></em>, the plot follows a film crew who use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>'s time machine to film a movie about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Vikings</a> for cheap. They use The Slow Path approach several times, such as leaving a script writer on an uninhabited island in the past for several months (his time), which for them took several seconds. They also end up sending a Viking named Ottar to Vinland by ship in order to film him getting there, while all they have to do is use the time machine. They also end up accidentally leaving their star actress behind when jumping forward by a year. They find her again as Ottar's wife and the mother of his child.

It's a very risky maneuver; time gates aren't permanent. No matter how stable, any gate risks going unstable and disappearing.
<ul><li> Not quite as risky as all that, actually. They move the slow way between two different gates, that open into different times and places, with a gap of a couple of years between them. So while 3 or so years passes for them the slow way, if they get to the second gate in less time than the time gap, they are guaranteed it will still be there, because it was there when they left Lala-land, and they could theoretically go back soon after the time they left (the tactic is still fairly risky for other reasons though - in-universe it is impossible to be in two places at the same time. If any of the party had been through the second gate at any time in the past, they would have vanished and died as soon as they overlapped themselves.)

</li><li> Ian Watson's 1979 short story <em>The Very Slow Time Machine</em> is, as the title suggests, very much an example of this trope, featuring a time-traveller who appears to be travelling backwards into the past at the rate of one hour per hour.

Al, who has extensively experimented with the wormhole and has recently been diagnosed with lung cancer, asks Jake to go back and prevent John F Kennedy's assassination. The issue is that the wormhole has strict rules: it always leads to the same place and date (Lisbon Falls, Maine, on September 9, 1958 11:58 AM), history actively resists attempts to change things, going back through the wormhole always returns you two minutes after you left, and going through again resets all the previous changes you made.

Will is distinctly unamused when she goes missing for what seems to him to be hours, only for her to show up in her <em>bedroom at the Sanctuary</em> and inform him that it had been more like a hundred and thirteen years. And despite being almost twice as old as she was at the start of the series she looks no different. But then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">she was already well over a century old</a> to begin with and still appeared to be only middle-aged.

When they finally work out a solution, Teal'c volunteers to be excluded from the time-reversal effect, so that he can deliver a plan to save the ship. Fortunately, as a Jaffa, his lifespan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">exceptionally long</a>, though he is still visibly older by the end of it.

<ul><li> When SG-1 are sent back to 1969 they meet a young Lieutenant Hammond, who helps them thanks to a note from his future self. He then has to take the long way to see them again as a General. It's also stated that his encounter with them was what led to the older him giving them the information they would need to get back, before they left. He could have even stopped them from going, but knew it would have created a paradox.
</li><li> Then at the end of the episode when trying to get home they accidentally go too far into the future. An elderly woman greets them in a clearly deserted SGC. Sam recognizes her as Cassandra - a young preteen in their time. She knew they were coming and was waiting for them to return them to the proper time. Meaning at some point Sam told her when she would need to be there and gave her the necessary technology, and she took the slow path to do so.

During their first visit, they encountered Abigail, a beautiful woman who was forced to live in suspended animation to avoid dying of a mysterious disease. Over the next few years, the Doctor would visit Kazran every Christmas Eve, and they would bring Abigail out of her cold sleep to celebrate the holiday with them.

The first two Christmas Eves, Kazran is played by Laurence Belcher (fourteen at the time of filming, but looked rather younger).

</li><li> In <em>The Crystal Bucephalus</em>, the Fifth Doctor spends three years as a restaurateur after being abandoned on a random planet in a different era (he's looking to get picked up by time-travelling restaurant critics from the title time-travelling restaurant).
</li><li> In <em>The Stone Rose</em>, the Doctor reveals at the end that he'd taken three years off in the middle of the story to study sculpture under Michelangelo in order to produce the title statue.

</li><li> The parody episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTheCurseOfFatalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoTheCurseOfFatalDeath">"The Curse of Fatal Death"</a> has a slight variation where the Master falls into a sewer which takes him <em>three hundred and twelve years</em> to crawl out of, before using his TARDIS to return to just a few moments after he fell in. <strong>Three times</strong>. He keeps tally after each incident, and is <em>very</em> tired and put out after nine hundred and thirty six years of sewer climbing, with only dung slugs for food and occasional company (although he is restored to full youth by the next part of the story).
</li><li> In the Ninth Doctor short story which would be adapted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E10Blink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E10Blink">"Blink"</a>, the TARDIS "burps" and leaves him behind in the 1980s.

(taking a few detours along the way to stop a selfish jerk from stealing it).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs3">Wild ARMs 3</a></em>, the protagonists manage to use a very powerful magic to send Asgard, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">persistent robot</a> hundreds of years into the past.

One the game ends and it's time for everyone to return to their proper place in time, she doesn't say her permanent goodbye to either Chester, Cless and Mint, each born a hundred years after her birth (hundred and one in Mint's case), or to Suzu, born about a one hundred and forty years after her, since she's a long lived Half-Elf and will live long enough to see them again. Klarth isn't so lucky, and bids a more permanent farewell. The problem here is that she and Chester had a short-lived romantic relation, and there's no telling if Arche will still be young after a hundred years.
<ul><li> It's confirmed in spin off <em>Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon</em>, where you meet her in the original game's present and fight her as your first boss. She's matured a bit, but only looks to be in about her 20s or 30s.
</li><li> What's the longevity of most relationships? What's the likelihood that a rather libidinous young half-elf won't find someone(s) else in the intervening century? Carrying a torch for someone who doesn't even exist yet for a hundred years would require either exceptional stubborn dedication or True Love.

When he is brought back to life by accident in the main setting point, he is as fresh as ever and is ready to remake Shurima's great reputation once again. The other Shuriman Ascended haven't had such an easy time of it - Nasus has become a solitary, somewhat tragic figure and Renekton has spent millennia sealed in a tomb with Xerath, which caused him to lose all grasp of reason and been twisted to side with Xerath instead (Xerath has been corrupting Renekton all these years and as a result has been having a great time, although it did cause him to lose all restraint on his ambition as well).

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em> Kang two-parter, Thor misses the time portal when the other Avengers follow Kang's ship to the 30th century. When they arrive, they find a white-bearded Thor leading the resistance.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Beast Boy:</strong> Maybe he's traveling forward one second at a time?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor">Elena of Avalor</a></em>, there is a forty-one year timeskip between the show's backstory and beginning. Isabel, Abuelo, and Abuela haven't aged the day since Alacazar magically turned them into an indestructible painting to protect them from Shuriki. Meanwhile, Elena is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">trapped inside of an amulet and fully aware of her surroundings during this time</a> (although she doesn't age) and life goes on for Esteban, who becomes Shuriki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> and grows into a middle-aged man by the time his family returns. Esteban is noticeably envious of the fact that his cousins are still youthful and that he's almost as old as his grandparents. Another episode has Elena meet her childhood friend, who is a middle aged woman who got married, then became widowed, all while Elena was in the Amulet.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> episode "Timetagger" uses this concept in both directions. A hero from the future with time-travel powers got stuck in the past after Cat Noir accidentally broke her miraculous. She hides herself in a stele from ancient Egypt for 5000 years to be rescued in the present by Ladybug and Cat Noir. At this time she also informs her present self of the future, though that's only a wait of a few years.

<ul><li> If you've ever wondered why your Great Aunt Whoever was always gushing about how you've grown at every family reunion, it's because of this trope... well sort of. Our subjective experience of time accelerates as we age. Explanations for why this is vary. It could be because any given interval of time is a smaller and smaller fraction of everything we've experienced thus far. It could also be because there are fewer milestone events for adults vs kids. Kids are moving up all the time, but for most adults you're usually stuck doing very similar things for years at a time, with the only major changes coming if you change jobs or move, and the years blur together. So while you may have felt like the last time you saw that great aunt was forever ago, to her it was really not all that long ago.
