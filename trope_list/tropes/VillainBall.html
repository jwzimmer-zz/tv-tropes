</div></div><p>"Evil sows the seeds of its own destruction", says the fortune cookie. Regardless of how savvy they might otherwise be, villains tend to inherently draw heroic attention to themselves that leads to their demise, or at least the demise of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>. Even if their success is seemingly assured, they can't seem to help but do something evil that serves no purpose other than giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> the extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">motivation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysClose">opportunity</a> to wreck everything, and he will.

</p><p>Sure signs that the Villain Ball is in play:
</p><ul><li> The villain adds needless complications to their plan for the sake of tormenting others. They may claim this is all for the sake of averting attention, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingCoverup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingCoverup">but it tends to have the opposite effect.</a>
</li><li> The villain insists on taking care of something personally when there's no reason an expendable mook couldn't do it, possibly due to the belief that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">Surrounded by Idiots</a>.
</li><li> The villain decide to dispatch the hero via a grisly and complicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">more pragmatic</a> solutions, ignoring that methods with more complex working parts are more likely to fail as opposed to simple solutions. A common result of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithinArmsReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithinArmsReach">Within Arm's Reach</a>, where a character in one of these traps or fights manages to just so happen to grab something that allows them to fight back — even though they're usually doing so in full view of said villain.

Inevitably, it's their own inherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaws</a> that lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">their downfall</a>, sometimes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>. This may even lead to an apropos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>.
</p><p>When a previously composed and unflappable villain picks up the Villain Ball and runs with it as soon as his plans start going awry (which, naturally, only hastens his downfall), it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>.

They would also accomplish any other goals like destroying/ taking over the world much faster if they didn't let it all rest on a one-on-one duel with him, a tradition Saiou/Sartorius finally breaks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">GX</a>.</em>
<ul><li> The series do what they can in terms of justifying it; most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> collections can <em>only</em> change hands in a duel and so forth.

Because all he needs to do is press a button, he can do it during the match. Judai/Jaden and his duel spirits can't leave the match. Of course, he started to break it when Judai first challenged him to the duel and Saiou's reaction was, paraphrased, "No. I've got what I need. I don't need to duel you." The only reason he did duel Judai was because Neos manifested to keep Saiou from getting the keys to the SORA satellite. *THEN* he used the duel in order to weaken Neos, which allowed him to steal the satellite keys and give them to his nearest brainwashed flunky, who could and did run off to get the satellite going while Judai was tied up in the duel. Saiou (or more precisely, the Light of Ruin/Destruction) didn't count on Kenzan/Hassleberry and Mizuchi/Serena, Saiou's own sister, teaming up to put a halt to things.

He ends up pissing Goku off enough to make him go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a> for the first time, leading directly to Frieza's undoing.
<ul><li> In the anime, he <em>does</em> try to shoot Goku immediately, only for Piccolo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">push Goku out of the way</a>, after which Frieza lets his sadism (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>) get the better of him.
</li></ul></li><li> Frieza picks it up <em>again</em> after becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Mecha-Frieza</a> and going to Earth with his father, King Cold. While Cold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis">originally planned for them to just blow up the planet from space and be done with it</a>, Frieza insists on landing and personally killing everyone to make Goku suffer. Within minutes of landing, they're met with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass">Future Trunks</a>, who slaughters them both effortlessly.
</li><li> And once <em>again</em> Frieza grabs it in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em> movie and its corresponding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> arc. When he is restored to life, he spends two months in training until he achieves a form that has power comparable to Goku's. Rather than continue to train in order to master this form and its power, and build up his empire to its former glory, Frieza impatiently rushes to Earth in order to get his revenge. As a result, his soldiers are decimated and, after going toe to toe with Goku for a while, his new form burns itself out of energy and leaves Frieza vulnerable to another humiliating defeat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thankfully, when he's revived again at the end of the <em>Tournament of Power</em> arc, he decides to put down the ball and goes off to rebuild his empire.</span>
</li><li> Freiza holds this ball even when it comes to his ignorant attitude towards training and obtaining more power. Due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">condescension towards the Saiyan race</a>, as well as his own arrogance and ego, he believes he never needs to train very hard or put any effort into a fight to overcome his enemies in battle. He just assumes his natural ability and superiority will pull through. In more recent times, this is starting to bite him in the ass. As of the end of Super, he is at best on par with Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Vegeta when in his golden form (the result of the one occasion where he actually decided to train for a short period of time, which resulted in a phenomenal power boost). Because he doesn't train anywhere near as hard as Goku or Vegeta, he is unable to defeat them, therefore preventing him from regaining his dominion over the universe. If he actually decided to train half as hard as someone like Vegeta does, he likely could easily overwhelm his enemies. Instead, he has found himself on the receiving end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">serious beatings</a> from the likes of Toppo, Jiren and Broly thanks to his inability to put his arrogance aside and realise he needs to train harder to become stronger.
</li><li> Both King Piccolo and the current Piccolo flew to the sky and wanted to kill Goku with a dramatic attack. Both times, Goku got the time to prepare the final blow or to escape. Then he won. In the case of King Piccolo, he succeeded in breaking Goku's legs and left arm... but forgot to take out his <em>right arm</em> as well, leading to his demise.

In his quest to drain worlds of life, he inexplicably decides to conquer New Namek, a planet with no real resources and only a few dozen people living on it under the protection of the protagonists, and doesn't even make use of its Dragon Balls. He has a giant mechanical space thing that lets him produce hundreds of Meta-Coolers that are individually stronger than the strongest protagonists. With that in mind, he spends most of the runtime instead utilizing much weaker robots so that the other characters can have something to fight, and initially sends in just one Meta-Cooler that Goku and Vegeta manage to take down. After his Meta-Coolers have thrashed the protagonists, he decides to take them to right in front of his vulnerable core, and tries to drain their power despite the fact that they're weaker than he is (and somehow, they still manage to overload him).

<ul><li> In the last arc of the series, Lelouch makes himself look a like a villain and kidnaps <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the heads of the UFN</span>. In truth, this is to use himself as a human shield, while everyone tries to fight him. The real point is to convince the actual villain, Schneizel, to grab his own villain ball, help out the people trying to kill Lelouch, and fire his super-weapons at the battlefield. What this does is open a big hole in his invincible, space-worthy, battlefortress.

Jacques' blunter is so spectacular in scope that in order to avoid getting metaphorically crucified by General Ironwood and Weiss, he stages things to make it look like Rin was kidnapped in a White Fang attack (and the resulting security revamp likely having its own consequences later down the line), but he also hires mercenaries in an attempt to re-secure Rin after she lands in Menagerie, which goes <em>poorly</em> thanks to Ghira Belladonna and his forces, and it also scares her off <em>again</em>, causing her to become paranoid enough to try to slip under the radar, suspecting that Weiss and Ironwood were potentially in on this scheme and had betrayed her trust (even later, when Rin is informed that Weiss is attending Beacon, she is too hesitant to contact her directly out of fear that she was under her father's thumb and might report back to him). Rin eventually ends up living with Taiyang Xiao Long and his daughters Yang and Ruby, who manage to secure her trust, and this ends up causing the technology that Jacques' craves to end up being used by a <em>competing company</em>. In his greed and impatience, Jacques scares off the golden goose, and ends up having to scramble to cover up his blunder, which would make things even worse for him if <em>anyone</em> from Atlas found out the truth. In the words of one forum poster...
<div class="indent"> <strong>CrowbarKnight</strong>: "Hmmm, you know I figured Jacques was a bit of a gambler, albeit more of the card counter or DArby variety then anything else, but I didnt know he was into playing <em>political Russian Roulette.</em>"
</div><ul><li> Now that the fic is <em>finished</em>, the epilogue details how this all finally ends: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacques is arrested for treason (with Winter taking him in after listening in on him plotting to capture Rin while also unintentionally confessing his guilt), amongst several other crimes he committed in his desperation to secure control over Rin</span>.

Also, in the end Jafar was already the most powerful sorcerer on Earth, more than strong enough to defeat Aladdin. Instead he had to be the most powerful creature and wished to be a genie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">with all that entails</a>. Years of planning and hardwork for Jafar end up being for nothing with someone else getting his greatest dreams all because he wanted to screw the kid over.
<ul><li> For that matter, his entire scheme of arresting Aladdin and disguising himself was flawed. Aladdin's entire world revolved around basically keeping fed with dreams of one day being rich. Jafar could have just as easily gone to him in person promising him amnesty and a solid payoff for his efforts, which he even more easily could have <em>actually given the kid</em>: a single pardon and a bag of gold would have meant nothing to him even as the vizier, let alone the new sultan.

If not for this, then the Imperials would have figured out what the stolen plans were without being forced to chase after Princess Leia, causing the entire original trilogy to happen.

Instead, he calls in a group of thugs to his office to have Axel thrown out, as in literally thrown through a plate glass window, at which point Axel is certain that Maitland is behind it all. Then there's the fact that when Maitland catches Axel and Jenny in one of his warehouses, having discovered a crate of cocaine, instead of having them both killed then and there, when he has them completely at his mercy, he kidnaps Jenny, taking her back to his house, while leaving Axel there not to be killed, at least not right away, but first to be beaten up by two thugs. That of course leaves enough time for Billy to rescue Axel, and for Axel, Billy, and Sgt. Taggart to rescue Jenny. If Maitland had had a triple-digit IQ, the movie would have been much shorter.

He's been embezzling money from his clients for years, and he fires most of his employees after a year or so, both to avoid having to pay too much in raises and to make sure that none of them have time to cotton on to what he's doing. This bites him in the ass when someone finds him out-he rearranges accounts to make it look like Fat Charlie, his most senior employee by a full year, was the one doing it, but the person he's trying to convince knows that it's been happening for much longer than Fat Charlie's two-year tenure. This ultimately leads to a murder, some attempted murders, and also slicing his own femoral artery with a poorly-chosen place to hold a knife. Of course, he may or may not have been possessed along the way.

</li><li> Everything the Capitol does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> seems to be based on how evil it is than whether or not it would be beneficial. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shooting an old man in a crowd just for singing a song, reducing District 12 into utter poverty to the point the protagonist wanted to rebel, rounding up a chunk of the victors of the games (people the public cherish and revere as heroes) into another game with the intent to kill, eliminating any good will between Katniss by brutally killing Cinna in front of her, eliminating the good will of pretty much any major character by brutally firebombing District 12 and killing civilians on TV.</span> Combined with the Hunger Games itself, it makes you wonder how the nation lasted for 75 years without any form of outward rebellion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which the districts are too happy to do in the span of a few months</span>.
<ul><li> Aside from the central extravagance of the hunger games (and even that is in some ways an inspired form of repression in that it forces people to become complicit in it through starvation, quite stalinesque actually) the tactics the capital uses to repress the districts are actually a fairly realistic representation of the terror methods that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> regimes use, and just like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> but unlike in most stories: They work, to a point. In 75 years of power the capital had almost certainly weathered minor uprisings that it had been able to quell through force, control of information, and playing districts off against each other. What tips the scale in the period of the plot is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> military support from district 13, inter-district organizational and information support from district 13 and rebels in the capital, and a unifying symbol for all the districts in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Katniss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Peeta</a> that had already been helpfully broadcast through the capital's own propaganda machine</span>.

</li><li> The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Relativity">Relativity</a></em> has two villains that fit this trope:

</li><li> Valdas Rasmas: He manages to capture all the heroes, but he doesn't kill them or even remove their masks, he brags about how brilliant the plan was. He even has a giant digital display showing how much time they all have to live.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that both of these villains ended up having to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">rescued by the heroes</a> in the end.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Adam Troy Castro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy">Sinister Six Trilogy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks">The Gentleman</a> had a rather malicious plan to screw over the entire world <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by crashing the world economy, setting off an EMP over New York and simultaneously releasing a catalyst that would bleach all ink including bank notes and contracts</span> and he might've gotten away with it if the plan didn't call for betraying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> and the Chameleon for no good reason.
</li><li> Saruman's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> makes no real sense. He wants to get the One Ring. How does he do this? He reveals his treachery to Gandalf when Gandalf comes to him for help, and then, after Gandalf escapes, he raises an army and invades Rohan. This despite the fact that by that point he had already subverted King Theoden to the point where had effective control of the kingdom anyway. Not only does his invasion fail, it leads pretty directly to Rohan's intervention on the side of Gondor against Mordor, with which Saruman was allied. Meanwhile, Saruman never gets anywhere near the Ring. If he had just pretended to still be Gandalf's friend and still loyal to the Istari and the White Council, he could easily have traveled to Rivendell with Gandalf, attended the Council meeting there, insinuated himself into the Fellowship, and then persuaded them that the easiest way over the Misty Mountains would be through the Gap of Rohan, and as long as they were passing through the Gap of Rohan, they might as well stop at Isengard for the night. Such a plan would have left him any number of opportunities to get the Ring. There was no reason to tip his hand to Gandalf so soon, or to invade Rohan when he did. It's no wonder Gandalf asked him (in the movie at least) why he exchanged wisdom for madness.
<ul><li> Some of this is justified by Saruman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">inability to understand Good</a>. Since he's an untrustworthy manipulator trying to secure power for himself, he tends to assume the rest of the White Council (especially Gandalf) are the same. Which effectively means he doesn't trust them enough to effectively betray them. And the fact that he's trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">out-play Sauron</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">at the Dark Lord game</a> means he starts <em>acting</em> like a Dark Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">well before he's got the power or position to back it up</a>.
</li><li> Sauron gets one by leaving the Cracks of Doom completely unguarded. While the heroes are successfully bluffing him into thinking Aragorn has the ring, you'd think the one spot in his territory where it's even possible to harm him would have <em>some</em> security. Of course, you'd <em>think</em> that, but Sauron wouldn't - like Saruman, he doesn't understand Good, and doesn't understand how or why anyone would willingly destroy the Ring, especially if they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">strong enough</a> to get all the way inside his territory.
<ul><li> Justified in this case though. Sauron's <em>mental</em> wards were strong enough for the possible ring destroyer to change their mind and keep the Ring for themselves. This nearly won the battle both times for Sauron, so much that the literal intervention of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> was the only thing able to stop his plans.

However, about a week earlier Shaw has issued a kill order on a traitor with Chuck as the trigger man. Knowing Chuck's squeamishness about killing, Shaw has Sarah relay the order, deducing that the only way Chuck would comply is if he thinks he's doing it for her. In the end it's Chuck's friend Casey who kills the traitor, but everyone else thinks Chuck did it, meaning Shaw has no reason to think he was wrong. So as far Shaw knows, he's not only threatening the only thing Chuck would kill for but <em>already has</em>, and yet he's somehow as surprised as everyone else when Chuck, out of other options, actually three-taps him in the chest.

(MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD) Highlights include:
<ul><li> Lord Tywin Lannister's and Queen Regent Cersei Lannister's spiteful and, often, rather petty abuse they give to their very competent relative (son and brother, respectively) Tyrion Lannister for the crimes of "murder" and being a supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedDwarf">Depraved Dwarf</a>, the latter of which is slightly true, but nonetheless exaggerated by the pair (the effect of Tyrion constantly being ostracized and mocked while his often stunning successes are downplayed and dismissed leads to him striking out against the ungrateful bastards. This directly leads to the family's downfall.
</li><li> Tywin revealing to Tyrion, for no other reason than to be an asshole, that Tyrion's first wife is actually a former whore who Tywin then <em>gives</em> to his men to be raped/paid for sex while Tyrion watches (leading to Tyrion's eventual cynicism and bitterness, his aforementioned outcast status, and to some very long-term bad blood).
</li><li> Tywin giving Tyrion a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> trial after Cersei accuses him of killing Joffrey because he was at the scene of the crime, which was a blatantly obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a> job by some unknown third party (leading to Tyrion's breakdown and setting him up for execution).
</li><li> And finally, Tywin's actions when Tyrion goes to confront him after being set free by his brother, Ser Jaime Lannister, and his friend, Lord "Master of Whisperers" Varys: Upon stumbling across Tyrion's ex-girlfriend Shae (another prostitute), in his father's bed she freaks out and attacks him with a knife which forces him to kill her. Tywin (while taking a shit on the toilet) decides to mock Tyrion (after the aforementioned ex's death) even as Tyrion is pointing a crossbow at his chest. Yeah...

Throughout the series, he pulls strings from the shadows, manipulating a great many people for, essentially, his depraved "love" for Catelyn Stark, and later her daughter Sansa. This ultimately earns him Sansa's distrust, but in Season 6 she is forced to rely upon him for aid, to which he responds by saving the day. As a result, he is once again welcome in her presence, even if she can never fully trust him again, and he ends up becoming her main advisor for a brief time. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a> strikes and he attempts to manipulate her and the rest of her family in such a manner as to have her sister killed/imprisoned and her brother removed from power, to be replaced by Sansa. Sansa saw through it. Had he done nothing but continue to support the Starks' forces, or even acted to mend the rifts between the three siblings, he would have regained more of the trust he'd lost - but by trying to break the family, he united them against him, and lost dearly</span>.

Worse still his MO is known by the police, making both murders entirely pointless. When Nix is prevented from meeting up with Arnett, Nix kidnaps protagonist Raylan Givens' ex-wife Winona, and makes Raylan play his game, despite that fact that he has reason to go after Raylan but he has heard of Raylan's reputation and can't resist testing himself against him, rather than flee with the several hundred thousand dollars worth of watches he now has on his person.

Stupidity, Crabtree. Thought-stunting, bat-blind stupidity is the sine qua non of incarceration."

Orks will destroy and loot highly advanced weaponry for parts so they can make their primitive shootas and vehicles (admittedly, they wouldn't know how to use them anyway), Chaos armies tend to fall apart due to second-in-command betrayal/costly sacrifices/religious differences resolved by chainaxe to the face, and Dark Eldar will happily take out their own leaders to take their place (while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> very strongly applies to the other two, the Dark Eldar turn it into a lifestyle). The Eldar's long-term plans rely heavily on misdirection and getting other armies to fight for them, but even when they're facing a common enemy like Necrons or Chaos they don't tell their allies/pawns everything they should know, and suffer for it.
<ul><li> There are documented cases of Chaos warlords deploying their elite Terminators to take a building, then running out of patience well before the Terminators have gotten anywhere and calling in an orbital strike.
</li><li> Dark Eldar <em>try</em> to avert this as hard as possible, since raids in real-space are difficult enough without backstabbing and their civilization is entirely dependent on the success of those raids. SOP is to keep the backstabbing on hold until they get back home. It helps that Dark Eldar raids are relatively small scale, meaning their success won't affect the status quo of the setting.

<ul><li> Arthas in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>. So hard. Any dumb thing that the evil guy can do just to prove his credentials, he does. Like telling the most important part of his army (who, by a strange coincidence, are one of about three parts of his army who have free will) that they were BAIT for a guy who was supposed to mow them down in seconds, but didn't even show up for said fight until they already lost. Did we mention he laughed at them, too? Oh, and he delivered the weapon that can beat him to said guy in this ploy. OH, and it turns out that after betraying and alienating his officer corps, he's having a tough time finding commanders. Whoops! <em>And that's just one example.</em>
<ul><li> There's also his tendency of finding his few surviving commanders in mortal danger and deciding that if they can't survive the battle then too bad. You'd think after losing every single known lieutenant he has he'd stop throwing their lives away.
</li><li> Well, he is the Lich King. It's not like when they die he can't just bring them back anyway. But really, why waste the time? Kill the snots that are screwing with you and just be done with it already.

In the Dragon Soul raid, after Thrall shoots him with the titular object, Deathwing flies back to the Maelstrom and tries to cause another Cataclysm. He apparently could have done this at any time, yet inexplicably waited until his enemies had killed all of his lieutenants, united the other Dragon Aspects, retrieved one of the few weapons powerful enough to kill him, and attacked him with it a couple times to try. At least Arthas had the somewhat flimsy excuse of wanting to make the player characters his champions, with Deathwing the writers didn't even try to justify it.
<ul><li> To be fair, he <em>is</em> pretty much batshit insane by that time.

It's all a result of and contributing to the biggest Villain Ball in World of Warcraft history, which will lead to his becoming the end boss of the Mists of Pandaria expansion. While killing the Horde warchief is obviously an endgame goal for the Alliance, everything he's doing in using the Horde as his personal war machine to dominate the world is turning more and more of the Horde against him as well. Hell, the expansion wasn't even released yet and some of the leaders were already conspiring against him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">alongside the playerbase</a>.

So... yeah, basically just the one guy.
</li></ul></li><li> Sylvanas Windrunner always had a spotty record but she entered <em>Legion</em> decidedly carrying this ball. Reasoning that a war with the Alliance was inevitable, she decided to initiate it on her terms. Over the course of a month she slaughtered civilians, put Darnassus and its civilians to the torch, and turned the Undercity into an uninhabitable wasteland in a failed attempt to assassinate the Alliance leadership. All of this has only succeeded in further unifying the Alliance against the Horde while leaving many of her own allies disillusioned with her reign.

See for yourself: he wants to use the said ball to destroy the Frozen Throne - the seat of the Lich King and thus eliminate the Undead army that threatens the world. Unfortunately, the side effects of the ball's operation include severe earth tremors hence Illidan's brother Malfurion jumps to conclusion that Illidan is up to destroying the world and sets forth to stop him. Does Illidan bother to clarify the situation and explain his plan which would without doubt be backed by Malfurion? He does, but only AFTER Malfurion destroys the Eye. That is a prime example of what happens when a Villain Ball collides with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall">Hero Ball</a>.
<ul><li> Not really. While Illidan can be blamed for not explaining what he was doing, the reason Malfurion was trying to stop him is because the Eye was tearing the world apart. Not much point in stopping the bad guy if you break the world in the process, huh?
</li><li> On the other hand Illidan was doing it for Kil'Jaeden had he succeeded, we can quite imagine what he might have rewarded Illidan had he finished the deed.

For a while, his plans go great, and he usually is a step or two ahead of his nemesis, Sonic. However, just when his plans are at their highest, everything goes horribly wrong. The monster reaches its highest potential, and then Eggman realizes that he made a huge mistake and ends up having to work with Sonic to get rid of his own mess. The villain ball part comes when you realize something: Given his past experiences, why in the hell would he continue this pattern just to be embarrassed and defeated? Also, he constantly blabs about his schemes to the <em>one guy who always defeats him</em>, even going so far as to have a <strong>worldwide broadcast about his plan when Sonic and his gang didn't have an idea of it before then</strong>. The only thing you can't accuse Eggman of is not trying to kill Sonic with his godlike creatures, because that is just something he naturally fails at, but is in no control of whatsoever.

He actually does a good job of controlling the Deadly Six in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld">Sonic Lost World</a></em>, only losing control over them because of Sonic's near-suicidal lack of impulse control.

He then loses control of what becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Fire and Ice</em>, and there's also all the times he loses control of his machines in the show...pretty much the only robots who DON'T betray him are his weaker mook robots and Orbot and Cubot (who STILL often go behind his back at times).

This is most blatant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, where Bowser's plan is to steal all the power stars in space, then use them to power a huge machine at the center of the universe that will give him control of every galaxy there is. When the game opens, he seems to be pretty far into his plans, and Mario has no idea they're even happening. The only reason Mario finds out is because Bowser decides to kidnap Peach right in front of Mario, setting the plumber on his trail with just enough time to stop his schemes.
<ul><li> Bowser also does this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> where his plan is actually pretty clever: have his kids turn the seven kings of the Mushroom Worlds into animals, forcing Mario and Luigi to travel far and wide to help them. While they're distracted, Bowser kidnaps Peach. This one worked like a charm — until Bowser sends Mario a taunting letter telling him exactly where to find the Princess.

But then instead he teams up with Bowser. Unlike most examples Antasma's plan is to get out of the Dream World and find the Dream Stone, and he needs power to do this, irrespective of source. When Bowser suggests kidnapping Peach, Antasma simply says that they can come back for her later. Bowser agrees, marking this the second time ever Bowser hasn't attempted to kidnap the Princess as part of the main plot. The other time was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>, where his attempt at kidnapping Peach isn't even mentioned in the game until right at the end of the game.

Unfortunately he claims to be "very territorial" and repeatedly goes after them, and of course it ends quite badly for him.

Saddler is often considered the smartest Resident Evil villain, which should tell you something.
<ul><li> Even dumber, Saddler's plan was to infect the president's daughter (Ashley) and send her back to the president without anyone knowing she was infected so she'd kill the president and, due to sheer luck, he managed to infect Leon as well. His plan had <em>succeeded</em> the second Leon freed her with the added bonus that the president would soon have an infected <em>bodyguard</em> as well as daughter. However instead of kicking back with a beer and watching them "escape" he confronts them, blabs his whole plan, and then <em>DOES EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEIR ESCAPE</em> culminating in capturing and locking up Ashley on the island that houses the parasite-removal machine mentioned above. His only "justification" for this (using that term <em>loosely</em> by the way) is he intended to hold her for ransom to make some money, and needless to say he's more responsible for his plan falling to pieces than Leon's sheer bad-assery (consider also that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">if Saddler's plan succeeded, he would've had access the entire U.S. Treasury</a>).

She's been his most important lieutenant who had never shown any sign of not being completely loyal to him, and there seems to be no reason at all why saving her would have been impossible. The result of this is that Kerrigan gets captured alive and turned into a general and eventually supreme commander of the Zerg and Raynor deserting him, both becoming his most dangerous enemies.

At the end of the first part, Chrysalis manages to convince everyone, including Twilight herself, that Twilight is being a horrible person and only accusing her because she's possessive of her brother. That would have neutralised the only threat to her plans, but it's just not evil enough, so she has to go and imprison her in the same place where the real Cadance was, apparently trying to make Twilight kill her — only to lead to her eventual defeat after Twilight doesn't and they flee together to stop the wedding. It's also a bit more complicated than that, with a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Bug War</a> in there and whatnot, but the way the good guys win in the end would not have been possible if the real Cadance had not been freed.

Unfortunately for him, Underdog didn't fail to catch even one, and eventually, Simon had thrown them <em>all</em>.

</li><li> Cadmus's plan to destroy the Watchtower is so ludicrously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">supervillainy</a> with so many extra mustache-twirling steps it's amazing <em>anyone</em> involved with it thought it would work. They fire a full salvo of massive missiles at the Watchtower which are effectively dropships that are filled with clones of the Ultimen controlled by Galatea, who intends to use the Ultimen as cover while she rigs the Watchtower reactor to explode and kill everyone on board. Why they didn't just fire missiles of the exploding or nuclear variety, which would have blown the Watchtower to high hell a heck of a lot faster and without the possibility of the Leaguers on board being able to <em>defeat</em> the invading Ultimen or stop the reactor from exploding, is anyone's guess. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot 'Em</a> doesn't even <em>begin</em> to cover their level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">villainous idiocy</a>.
