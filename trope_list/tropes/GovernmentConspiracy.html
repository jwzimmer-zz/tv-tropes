The events of Alabasta, resolved by the Straw Hats, were credited to Smoker because he was the highest ranking Marine there at the time. They would have done the same with Dressrosa, but Admiral Fujitora torpedoed those plans by broadcasting what really happened before the government even knew about it.
</li><li> In the past, Nagi's work in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> was made more difficult by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Fate's</a> group had several secret supporters in the various governments of the Magic World. In the present, considering how one of Nagi's old friends warned our heroes to be wary of Ostia's Governor-General, it seems Negi is in a similar situation as well. That's just the tip of the iceberg. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The masterminds behind the attack on Negi's home village were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">members of the Megalo Mesembria Senate</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">have been pulling the strings of the Senate since the beginning of the war, which they helped start</a>.</span>

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series has had a number of these:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> suggests that the Titans came about due to a conspiracy in the Federation government. Namely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jamitov Hymem knew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Operation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Stardust</a>, and willingly played along (without Delaz's knowledge), thinking that the resultant destruction would frighten the Federation into approving an autonomous military force in space. It worked perfectly.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em> has LOGOS, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a group of extremely rich weapons manufacturers who spark wars in an effort to keep selling their products. They have several world leaders in their collective pocket. They are also the true leaders of the global terrorist organization Blue Cosmos.</span>
</li><li> Celestial Being in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> has hundreds, perhaps thousands, of agents in numerous governments and powerful corporations across the world, which explains where their vast information network and funding comes from. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ribbons Almarck starts one in the second season, pulling the strings of the newly-united world government to do whatever he wants.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em> meanwhile reveals that Laplace's Box is this for both the Vist Foundation and the Universal Century as a whole. Especially since the contents would effectively destroy the entire Earth Federation if they were ever revealed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: The walls that surround and protect all that's left of humankind from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">the Titans</a><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>have countless Colossal Titans inside of them.</em> Only the royals and the high-ranking members of the Wall Cult know about them, and they keep it secret from all other humans.</span>
<ul><li> The government has also banned books about the world outside the walls and made it a taboo to even show interest in venturing outside the walls. They also have the military return weapons not made to their specifications, even if the weapon was significantly improved.
</li><li> Even worse are the Millitary Police Secret Service, an elite death squad equipped with anti-soldier 3D-Maneuver gear and led by serial killer Kenny <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ackerman</span>. They effectively rule the military police and send mp grunts on murder missions. Most of the soldiers in the military police are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> but some have taken a liking to the slaughter of civilians whose only crimes were quietly criticizing the government, getting in the way... or making weapons/technology that could better fight the titans. This slowly drives the survey corps (Rebels) insane.
</li><li> As it turns out, all of the above is done for one purpose: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To ensure the Titans' rule over humanity. The most damning thing is that the ruling Reiss family has had access to a power that could have freed humanity at any time for nearly a century, but did nothing.</span>
</li><li> And the reason WHY they're such extreme isolationists? Because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everything right outside of the Titan continent is <em>Naziland</em>, known as the Kingdom of Marley. <em>Nazis with blimps, machine guns, and even their own spec-ops Titans</em>. They seek the enslavement and genocide of the 'Eldian' race. Guess which race the islanders are</span>. It really is death out there.
<ul><li> And as a final insult, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Kingdom of Marley is secretly ruled by an elite family of Eldians, who have generally pulled the strings of their non-Eldian subjects with bigoted fanaticism and threw the other Eldians under the bus with apartheid and forced conscription up to and including <em>human sacrifice</em>.</span>

Of course, the Government tries to pass off his discovery as the ramblings of a madman before rubbing him out...

It turned out that an agency in the actual U.S. Government (which one was not revealed) was behind this scheme. Worried that the economy's dependence on the Gold Standard might be a liability if gold were to lose value in a crisis, this agency was actually considering using cocaine as the new standard, reasoning that drugs always had value. While both Spider-Man and the Punisher knew this was a sick and misguided idea, they decided against exposing it; not only would it be hard for a judge to believe "a man in a mask like me and a walking gun shop like you" as Spidey put it, knowing about such a thing would hurt — if not destroy — what trust remained in America's government. (However, they <em>did</em> destroy the cocaine. Letting the conspiracy continue was not an option.)

They're a group of Star Fleet officers who either work for the organization secretly, or just look the other way for them. They basically believe that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">The end justifies the means</a>", almost literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>, and are willing to commit Genocide when it comes to defending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> (or just Earth, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> era).

<ul><li> Section 31 were actually vital to achieving a happy ending for the Dominion War. Because it's explicitly stated (in "Statistical Probabilities", and by a Changeling admitting to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth">Salt the Earth</a> strategy) that the Alpha Quadrant would have become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, had Odo not been able to use the cure to broker peace. This means that Section 31 did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork">rescue the entire quadrant</a>, and can be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villains</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanhasaPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanhasaPoint">with a point</a>.
<ul><li> Except that their plan wasn't to broker a peace with the Changelings; their plan was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>, and the virus they gave them probably led directly to the paranoid breakdown the Female Changeling suffered that caused her to order the xenocide of everyone on Cardassia, not to mention had Odo <em>not</em> broked the peace but the Changelings <em>did</em> remain infected, the Dominion may have still lost but they probably would have pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> on as many of their enemies as possible. So really, what Section 13 did counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!</a>, if a rare case where "fixing it" was actually a good — but unintended — outcome for them anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Section 31's name derives from Article 14, Section 31 of the Starfleet Charter, which makes allowances for bending Starfleet regulations in times of extraordinary threat. The organization, of course, promptly seized on that to motivate their existence (apparently reasoning that there always <em>some</em> extraordinary threat around or brewing).
</li><li> Aside from Section 31, there is also a conspiracy in the Trill government: officially, the viability of a Trill being a host for a symbiont is a mere 1 in 1000. In truth, however, approximately half of all Trills can be a host. The problem is that there is only a comparatively small number of symbionts, so the government perpetuates the lie of the low rate of Trill host viability, lest the truth leads to the symbionts becoming coveted commodities to be fought over. The truth was nearly brought to light as a result of Joran Belar, an officially "unsuitable" host noted as being violent and mentally unstable, receiving the Dax symbiont by mistake and accepting the symbiont without rejection.
</li><li> <em>TNG</em> also revealed a conspiracy within the Klingon government to pin the blame of the massacre at the Khitomer colony on Mogh, Worf's father. As a result of this conspiracy, Worf would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfTheFather">condemned as the son of a traitor</a>. In truth, the traitor was actually Ja'rod, the father of Duras, who allowed the Romulans to destroy the colony. Because Duras was in a position of considerable power and influence, however, he and the Klingon High Council had a vested interest in keeping the truth of the massacre from being revealed, forcing Worf to accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">discommendation</a>. It would be some time until the conspiracy was dismantled with the previous Klingon chancellor's death, Duras's death at the hands of Worf, and Duras's family being defeated in a subsequent civil conflict.

</li><li> Tom Clarke initially believes that there is a government conspiracy of a very different kind. In "Jacob and Jesse", he tells his sister Becky that the Lubbock Lights (which they saw in "Beyond the Sky") were just street lights reflected off a flock of plover birds. He says that all of the stories about UFOs are just the government's cover story. In "Acid Tests", having read Tom's work, Sam tells his brother Eric that the UFO project is a conspiracy which is intended to distract people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> and the secret testing of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. In "Maintenance", Tom tells his younger half-brother Jacob that he has come to the conclusion that his father John was a soldier who was injected with psychotropic drugs and Jacob developed abilities as a result. Jacob is less than convinced since the supposed UFO cover story seems extremely far-fetched.

As well as this, the day before the launch of HAT-1, a space center staff member was murdered by the same spy. The government however, covered up the real events behind both the HAT-1 incident and the murder, ordering that the murder investigation and conviction be rushed, so as to forever get rid of the terrorist behind the bombing of the HAT-1 from the public. They also forged a fake story for what "really happened" on to HAT-1, saying that the malfunctions were due to simple technical faults, causing a movie to be made called "The HAT-1 Miracle" (This is supposed to be the in-universe equivalent of the Apollo-13 Miracle). Seven years after all this occurred, aka in the game's final episode, the same spy ends up bombing GYAXA's Cosmos Space Center again, as well as a courtroom, leading to Phoenix Wright finally revealing the spy's identity and working out the conspiracy behind the HAT-1 Miracle.</span>

Most Americans are smart enough to comprehend that 9/11 was done by "a bunch of pissed-off Muslims," but the rest are "retarded" and need a conspiracy to believe in.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples are, of course, objects of much debate, but the handful of confirmed conspiracies traceable to the United States government is large enough to be depressing. Notable examples include:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Watergate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, of course, is the most well-known, so much that most modern-day scandals have "-gate" added to the end as a suffix.
</li><li> Teapot Dome was likely the most notorious before Watergate, an executive order Harding signed that was, in effect, the result of bribery in order to gain leases on oil-rich lands. While many were arrested and convicted, Harding was never officially accused of anything—chiefly because he seems not to have known about the illegal activity that put the order on his desk, but also in part because he died before anyone but the conspirators knew what had happened.
</li><li> COINTELPRO, an FBI task force created in the mid-50s to sabotage, harass, and some even say murder "subversive" organizations, including Civil Rights groups, workers' unions, anti-war protests, the Black Panthers, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Discontinued in the early 70s, but you'll find plenty of people who say otherwise.
</li><li> Operation Mockingbird, in which the FBI manipulated journalists and news media outlets to only run stories the FBI wanted the American public to hear.
</li><li> The Iran-Contra Affair, an elaborate three-way deal between the CIA, Iran, and a band of Nicaraguan rebels. To be brief, the CIA sold weapons to Iran in exchange for cash and hostages, then funneled much of the proceeds into the pockets of the Contras—all well and good, if it weren't illegal.
</li><li> And of course the stories of the U.S. government's (specifically the CIA's) involvement in the trafficking and selling of cocaine through third parties, which supplied the drug dealers on the street and which caused the crack epidemic that hit the inner cities hard. Supposedly it helped fund illegal operations elsewhere, like the above Contras. While no one has proven the CIA directly was involved with and/or knew about the drug smuggling, it seems clear they didn't much care to know or stop it either.
</li><li> The ATF gunwalking scandal, better known as Operation Fast and Furious, in which the ATF deliberately allowed firearms dealers to sell guns to straw buyers connected to Mexican drug cartels. It resulted in the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress during the ensuing investigation; many gun rights advocates and other conservatives have accused the ATF, Holder, and the Obama administration of using Fast and Furious as a scheme to spur increased violence and gain more public support for gun control.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Probably one of the sickest conspiracies ever</a> was the Tuskegee Experiment, wherein US Health Officials willingly and readily prevented African-American men from getting aid for syphilis, which even at the time the experiment was performed was treatable, just to see what effect the disease would have as time went on (never mind the fact that humanity had known about syphilis and its effects for centuries, if not longer).
<ul><li> Considering how popular the eugenics movement was at the time, this is far from surprising. The Tuskegee Experiment was also far from the worst of them performed by the US government, let alone some of the experiments which were considered highly unethical even by the looser standards of medical ethics, which were performed by doctors for medical research without government funding. And let's not even <em>start</em> on the role of the states in eugenics (look up the Eugenics Board of North Carolina if you want to be particularly horrified)...
</li></ul></li><li> Project MKULTRA is a rather well known one. The CIA attempted to use LSD, other drugs, and hypnosis to develop some form of mind control.
<ul><li> They also used ridiculously damaging amounts of electroshock, sensory deprivation and other experimental treatments on its subjects to try to inform brainwashing. One of the more well-known theories is that the ultimate goal was in fact to set up dissociative identities in the subconscious of certain individuals that could be activated at any time, override the primary personality, and be completely obedient and subservient (usually for purposes of assassination). Yes, the CIA apparently wanted to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a>. Whether <em>this</em> is true or not, there is strong evidence, as well as scattered victim testimony, that they used a large number of psychiatric patients as guinea pigs for experimentation — often without consent — for 2 primary reasons: 1) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">No one believes a crazy person</a>, and 2) people with psychosis and complex neurosis are easier to break, with personality integrity already being fragile, and are subsequently much easier to reformat and shape. Unfortunately, determining whether a schizophrenic who believes they were brainwashed by the CIA is reporting reality or fiction sort of proves the point. For further conspiracy, there is widespread belief among conspiracy-theorists and ex-CIA agents alike that the idea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinistryOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinistryOfTruth">that MKULTRA has in fact been stopped is misinformation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">the project continues in various modernised forms to this day.</a>
</li><li> Interestingly, the only drug that proved remotely useful for the purpose was simple pot, and it wasn't the CIA that did it, but the FBI. They spiked an arrested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">gangster</a>'s cigarettes with THC (it was not unusual then to give a perp cigarettes, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes">pretty much everyone was a smoker</a>), and he proceeded to spill the beans on some heist or other. Of course, even THC proved to be prohibitively unpredictable.
</li><li> Using alcohol for exactly that purpose (usually by covert agents of the government) is centuries-old, thus the Latin idiom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">In Vino Veritas</a>. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn describes it as a fairly common procedure used by NKVD to get signed confessions (usually fake, as many political prisoners were in fact innocent). He notes that it was particularly effective in the case of prisoners unaware that malnutrition greatly decreases their resistance to toxins.
</li></ul></li><li> The various attempts to assassinate or discredit Fidel Castro that the CIA carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. Everything from attempting to sabotage his diving equipment to poisoning / drugging his cigars (often with some form of psychotropic drug — <em>again</em> with the psychotropic drugs...) to attempting to create some kind of chemical that would cause his hair to fall out, thus ridding him of his iconic beard. You couldn't make some of these things up.
</li><li> Similarly, Operation Northwoods, a series of proposals to drum up support for a war against Castro's Cuba through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> against U.S. military and civilian targets, among which was included a "Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington". While the plan was rejected by President Kennedy and none of the proposals ever became operational, it has been used by conspiracy theorists ever since its declassification and release as evidence that there are elements within the U.S. government who have no qualms over deceiving and even attacking citizens.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> has been involved in several revolutions all around the world since the 1950's — most infamously Iran's 1953 coup, but also Guatemala in '54, the attempted '58 revolution in Indonesia, the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in '59, South Vietnam in '63, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions">and so forth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There's also coups in which the CIA is suspected of merely offering tacit support for the plotters, such as Syria in '49, Brazil in '64, and Turkey in 1980. And of course there are the things the CIA has gotten involved in that we don't know about yet.
</li></ul></li><li> During Prohibition, many speakeasys were supplied by stealing alcohol intended for industrial uses. The FBI responded by covertly poisoning the industrial alcohol en masse. What followed was called "The Chemists War", a battle between bathtub Chemists trying to remove the poisons and the FBI adding increasingly deadly concoctions to the industrial alcohol supply.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes Alliance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the intelligence alliance between major English-speaking nations (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and US), which was used to spy on not just those countries' adversaries, but their own citizens and other allied countries as well.
</li><li> The Great Purge orchestrated by Nikolai Yezhov's NKVD on the orders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> was officially a "swift retribution for the assassination of Sergei Kirov, beloved comrade and close friend of Stalin, an act indicating a reactive conspiracy in the highest echelons of Soviet government". Stalin was baffled and angry at the killing, and yet more baffled when the official investigation (accurately, as we now know) determined that Kirov really had been murdered by a run-of-the-mill embittered, gun-toting loony (Leonid Nikolaev) when Kirov's bodyguard had been distracted. For a whole host of reasons 1935 was shaping up to be a good year to execute 850k potentially-troublesome people and imprison another million, so even though Stalin knew it was a lie he took the opportunity to claim that Kirov had been assassinated by 'rightist elements' to justify doing so.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikitaKhrushchev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikitaKhrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> was the first senior Soviet politician to officially endorse an alternative conspiracy surrounding Kirov's death, which also claimed that it had been an assassination but said that it was <em>Stalin</em> who had ordered him killed. Unfortunately for Khruschev, the investigation he ordered into the assassination also concluded that Nikolayev did it — so when Khruschev spread rumors about Stalin being behind Kirov's murder, he had to do so with no actual evidence. Even so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">Stalin's reputation ensured that many in The West believed Khruschev's tenuous claims right up until the mid-1990s</a>, when NKVD archives (including Nikolaev's diary, which is a tome of pure crazy) burst that particular bubble. Some people in the former USSR still believe that Stalin was behind it to this day, unsurprisingly.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>. The various generals and military officials would often double cross one another, ignore orders from Tokyo, lie to their superiors, and even start whole wars complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>. The reasons for this varied wildly: some wanted to increase their personal standing in Japan. Some wanted to bring more political power to their particular province. Some wanted to increase funding to their branch of the military. Budget disputes between the Army and the Navy even resulted in an invasion of the Soviet Union and possibly the declaration of war on the United States. Certain units of the military, such as the Kwantung Army, also acted completely independently of the main government and any officer with a higher rank than their current commander. This was also the period of government by assassination in which doves in the government were mostly assassinated throughout the 1930s such that by the war there were virtually none left in power. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">With all of these figures competing for influence,</a> it's hard, even now, to determine who was really in charge of it all. The Emperor was supposed to have all the power, but the military could and would invade countries without even informing him. This wasn't helped by the US occupation forces intentionally muddling up the history of the government at the time; they needed the Emperor alive to make sure the occupation went peacefully, and tried to portray everything as the fault of the Prime Minister.
<ul><li> Kei cars and other laws regarding vehicle size are secretly Japan's government conspiracy since the postwar days. Originally, the kei cars were designed to be an alternative transport method to motorcycles, but the government has been promoting them by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LoopHoleAbuse/RealLifeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LoopHoleAbuse/RealLifeLaw">giving them tax breaks and subsidies</a>. With the government's ridiculous tax penalties to large vehicles, these small cars received many benefits and all Japanese car makers have been backed by government budgets until recent times. However, this also turned Japan into a Galapagos automotive market, effectively closing the foreign competition out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">killed off many larger cars as well</a>, with the help of unique safety and emission laws that are <em>not compatible</em> with global standards. Now, some few government officials have warned that kei cars are starting to hurt the automotive industry in Japan, calling them a waste of research and development costs, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">the general public in Japan loving these small cars</a>.
