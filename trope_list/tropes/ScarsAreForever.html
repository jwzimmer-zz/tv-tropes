Most if not all scars <em>really</em> are permanent, though - some are just more visible than others.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>: Tokiko got the long scar across her nose from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent">homunculus</a> attack when she was a child. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodCaptain">Captain Bravo</a> has said that it could have been healed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemyIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlchemyIsMagic">power of alchemy</a>, but she wanted to keep it to signify her birth as a warrior, and as a reminder of her hatred of homunculi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> has a part where they talk about how supposedly scars that have strong emotions associated with them linger longer, and as a result, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenshin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero">cross-scar</a> sticks around until he reaches emotional resolution near the end of the story, and the future scenes mention how it's finally fading.</span>
</li><li> Guts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> loses his right eye and part of his left arm to the demons during the events of the Eclipse that ends the anime. He has the arm replaced with a cool metal one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">doubles as a repeating crossbow and a gunpowder cannon</a>, but nothing can be done about the eye. He's also got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticPlotDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticPlotDevice">Brand of Sacrifice</a> on his neck which acts as a lightning rod for more demons, and it's not going away anytime soon either. Casca, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, has the same brand mark on her left breast, and because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">became mute and withdrawn</a> as a result of the severe traumas she suffered during the Eclipse, it's even more problematic for her.
<ul><li> As the story goes on, he acquires more and more scars on his face and body. The manga is remarkably consistent about keeping them around. His first and most distinctive scar is the one across his nose, given to him by Gambino while he was training Guts as a child.
<ul><li> After his repeated use of the Berserker Armor (Which keeps broken bones together by piercing his flesh with spikes), nearly every inch of his body is covered with scars, or at least wounds that aren't likely to heal soon. It also gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe">Skunk Stripe</a> in his hair.
</li><li> After his fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">the Kushan Emperor</a>, he's covered in large burns on top of everything else. Though the burns eventually went away.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, Yzak gets a rather nasty scar fighting against Kira and swears to keep it until he defeats the Strike Gundam. By the time of the sequel he's gotten over his grudge, made peace with Kira, and had the damage surgically repaired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>'s Char Aznable got a small scar across his forehead from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a> he had with protagonist Amuro at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>. It sticks with him through all his future appearances in the franchise. Prince Dozle Zabi has multiple facial scars (and probably scars all over the rest of his body) from a car bomb attack 11 years before the start of the series that also killed his younger brother Sasro.
</li><li> Throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em>, Domon has a cross scar on his right cheek. It is never explained, though it`s likely that he got it during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">training</a> with Master Asia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> generally avoids this: cellular regeneration technology allows for near-perfect healing of most injuries. However, Louise cannot regenerate her right hand after it's blown off by a Gundam Throne attack, because the Thrones' weapons use toxic GN particles that interfere with the regeneration treatments. She gets a prosthetic instead, which doesn't seamlessly integrate with her arm. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is undone at the end of Season 2 as the Trans-Am Burst healed Louise's physical damage, allowing her hand to be regrown.</span>
<ul><li> In the season one finale, Graham Aker is piloting a mobile suit using the same type of toxic GN reactor as the Thrones. When he and Gundam Exia pilot Setsuna F. Seiei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">take each other down</a>, the explosion of his reactor leaves Graham with major scarring on the left side of his chest and face, which similarly can't be removed. In season 2, he covers his scarred face with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskPower">a mask</a>, but as of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> he no longer hides them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">Gundam Build Divers</a></em>, when Riku converts the Gundam 00 Diver Ace into the Gundam 00 Sky, he retains the scar on the Gunpla's chest, covering it with a special cockpit. It serves as a reminder of his past battles.
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> has Yamato receive some scares in the final episode. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Strangely enough</a>, when the world is regressed to before the Septentriones attack it, he <em>still</em> has them, despite it not making any sense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Grimmjow intentionally employs this trope, preventing Orihime from healing the nasty chest scar he got from Ichigo during their second fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He also kept the collarbone scar that Nnoitra gave him when he attacked him from behind</span>.
</li><li> Ikkaku's scar from his fight with Ichigo doesn't seem to have healed.
</li><li> Kenpachi's scars from his fight with Nnoitra are still there. The scar over his eye is from his childhood and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars">aches whenever he sees the person who gave it to him</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unohana</span> has a large scar between her breasts that Kenpachi gave her when she gave him the scar over his eye. She too notes it aches in his presence.
</li><li> Yamamoto and Mayuri's bodies are littered with scars.
</li><li> Hisagi has claw marks on his face he got from a hollow when he was still a rookie.

Meanwhile, the body of Commander Waltz, Subaru's commanding officer in the Disaster Rescue division, is covered with burn scars he got when he pushed himself too hard during the airport fire incident, an act that made him known as a hero, but injured him enough to be retired from front-line duties.
<ul><li> In the original series, Nanoha's father Shirou, when seen in the bath, is covered with scars. They were received during one incident he had at his old job that resulted in him being hospitalized for a long time. Presumably, this incident was the same one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat">killed</a> his counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TriangleHeart3SweetSongsForever">Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever</a></em>, so this Shirou got off lucky.

<ul><li> In chapter 107, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ed's arm is restored when Al sacrifices himself in exchange. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">However</a>, Edward still has the scars where his automail used to be connected to flesh</span>.

This creates wounds that are visible for some time, but eventually heal.
</li><li> Scars in general, and their permanency, are a significant motif throughout the story; characters' scars are a device continuously used to demonstrate their sacrifices, mistakes, and losses, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">Rule of Symbolism</a> means they can never be left behind, for the sake of the theme - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">that all things come at a price</a>.

<ul><li> First off, Zoro. His first one is a huge diagonal scar that takes up his whole chest, from being all but cut in half, and always reminds him of his reason to fight (to defeat the man who gave it to him). The second (and third) are two matching scars around his ankles from when he tried to cut his own feet off. Oddly enough, they have absolutely no sentimental significance and haven't even been mentioned since they happened. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, Zoro has another scar down his left eye.
</li><li> Luffy himself has a semi-circular scar under an eye that never vanished. He cut it himself as a kid to prove to Shanks how hardcore he was. During the Battle of Marineford Luffy gets another, large X-shaped scar on his chest, delivered by Akainu while he was catatonic over the death of his older brother Ace.
</li><li> Speaking of Shanks, he has three scars across his right eye (although the eye itself is fine. He eventually reveals that the scar was given to him by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Blackbeard</a></span> at some point in the past.
</li><li> Crocodile has stitches that look as though his entire upper-face was nearly cut off, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> say it will play some more important soon. Fans occasionally joke that his nose itched and he scratched with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookHand">wrong hand</a>.
</li><li> Brook is noteworthy for having a large scar on his forehead that's still present after his death and resurrection as a skeleton, in the form of a visible skull fracture underneath where scarred flesh used to be.
</li><li> There's also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aojiki, who got some pretty nasty burn scars from his duel with Akainu over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a></span>.
</li><li> For a more minor example, Nami's backstory shows that she was kidnapped as a child after Arlong shot her adoptive mother Bell-mère. Nami's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> Genzo tried to save her but got slashed all across his body and face as a result.

</li><li> Notably defied with the Sun Pirates' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveBrand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveBrand">Slave Brand</a>. Their captain Fisher Tiger branded himself and each member of his crew (as well as Koala) with a sun mark, masking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveBrand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveBrand">Slave Brand</a> and making it impossible to tell which members were slaves and which were not.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> manga and Hades OVAs, Shiryu was rendered blind permanently. Ikki also keeps a scar on his face from his training in Death Queen Island. Contrast that with the anime, where Shiryu's blindness seems to be as easily reversed as a slight scratch in your skin.
</li><li> Chichiri in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> has a massive scar where his left eye used to be.

Watanuki's heterochromia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">also count</a>, considering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he got it to try saving Doumeki's eyesight from a curse.</span>

Almost every fight he has with Sousuke ends with him receiving a new scar - to the point where his final scars and wounds leave him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">limbless and with only one eye</span>. Sousuke also has a cross-shaped scar on his chin that is permanent, though it's never explained. He also has some more on his body. Not quite as noticeable in the anime, since he rarely takes his shirt off.

<ul><li> Black Star gained a permanent, significantly-placed scar during his fight with Mifune. It cuts across the star tattoo on his shoulder and could have been removed by Kim's magic but he decided to leave it as it was. It could be seen as an image of how his new resolve about the Nakatsukasa Purpose has allowed Black Star to turn from the path of the Kishin, which his clan fell to and eventually destroyed them (well, figuratively speaking. Technically, Shibusen was responsible).

Joe</a></em> comics, Snake-Eyes originally wore a mask because he was really ugly without it—burn scars and so on. About halfway through the comics' run, he got reconstructive surgery and looked pretty much normal afterward, except for a scar on his lip. He kept wearing the mask, mainly because he is supposed to be a badass ninja supercommando.
</li><li> He also immediately got a cauldron full of hot coals tossed into his face by one of the trio of torturers the Baroness had hired. As an issue all of 4-5 issues before the end of the original run showed, his face was <em>still</em> somewhat badly scarred, just in this case it looked more like the burns were nowhere near as severe as the original ones. Which makes sense, when we balance aviation gas from a crashing helicopter versus a bunch of hot coals...

<ul><li> Doom received third-degree or chemical burns to the face in an ill-fated experiment in college and later made it worse by putting on a steel mask while it was still red-hot. Why he keeps the scars is known only to him, maybe as a reminder that even he isn't perfect. It isn't for lack of restorative means; he once healed the severe burns on Storm's arm <em>and</em> restored nerve and muscle function after she was burned by the Human Torch, so he has the technology lying around. But still, one of the most consistent things in the Marvel Universe is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">the scars themselves are never shown on panel, just other characters commenting on how horrid they are</a>.
</li><li> Jack Kirby drew Doom without his mask <em>once</em> as he interpreted the character. Doom's scars were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">non-existent, except for a single light scar on his cheek. The King thought Doom was so vain that such a little scar was enough to make Doom hide his face forever.</span>
</li><li> Ultimate Doctor Doom zig-zags it. He can heal any wound or disfigurement inflicted by anything except his own spiky projectiles. An injury from one of them won't heal and scars him permanently.
</li><li> In the sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX">Earth X</a>, Universe X, the Human Torch is able to convince Doctor Doom that they are both dead by ripping off his mask, melting it into a smooth, reflective surface, and showing Doom that his facial scars are completely healed.
</li><li> Scott Lang claimed that Doom can't help but scar his face again and again no matter how often he fixes it with cosmic powers because it lets Doom pretend that people hate him because he looks like a monster. Doom can't face the real reason: people hate him not because of the scar tissue on his face, but because of the scar tissue on his soul.

However, in fanart, and sometimes fanfic, it's pretty common for Adora to end up with one or more visible claw marks - back, shoulder, face, fan artists seemingly aren't picky - as a visual metaphor for the emotional pain inflicted by her messy relationship with Catra. This is, seemingly, particularly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeRomanceSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeRomanceSubtext">stuff that ships Catradora</a>, possibly to add to the emotional weight.

Even though the scar could have been easily removed, he elected to keep it as a reminder that it was given to him by Lews Therin 3000 years ago. Plus, in the timeframe where the books take place, the only person in the world with the knowledge to remove said scar is a twisted sociopathic torturer who extracts a toll in pain from anyone she Heals.

As a result, one of his legs is crippled, he's missing every other tooth (opposite teeth in each row, so that he's incapable of chewing anything), and one of his eyes is permanently squinting, prone to bouts of twitching and weeping independent of the other. His back is frequently painful. He also had his nipples and all of the toes on one of his feet cut off. As one would imagine, he becomes a fairly unpleasant person; somehow, he still manages to be awesome.

He could've had it removed, of course, through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">bacta treatment</a>, but he keeps it for years, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">a reminder</a> of the harm he did indirectly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Ton Phanan dies, a provision in his will requires Face to remove the scar (which he does, though he keeps a fake one for a while), which is in turn symbolic of Phanan's help convincing Face that he really shouldn't feel guilty about it.</span>

It became infected while healing, leaving the nerves dead so that he can't move that side of his face and it slurred his speech. Neither that scar nor the ones on his leg or on his brother Felix's back have ever really faded.

Captain William Fredrickson is missing an eye, his front teeth, and part of an ear.

Their injuries don't stop healing or heal imperfectly, like a normal person's — they heal until the injury is 100% GONE, as in, no sign it ever happened. This is noted when Harry gets and X-ray; he's had a number of broken bones in his life, but his bones simply look as if they've never been broken at all. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRites">Blood Rites</a> his left hand effectively melts when Harry's magical shield kept out the flames but didn't keep out the heat.

However, if the injury is major and a healer doesn't tend to it, it will leave a scar. This becomes a plot element in <em>Seeker's Mask</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jame has her cheek sliced open to the bone by Kallystine's ring</span>. Because this could cause a diplomatic incident, throughout much of the book, her keepers are trying to track her down so that she can be properly healed.

He also has numerous scars over his chest from where the dark fey tortured and raped him in exchange for the mortals freedom — he chose to give the court himself rather than the mortals, whom he knew wouldn't survive such things. He is adamant that the scars are proof that he survived, that he is still surviving, and remind him not to give in to what he truly is — a dark fey, just like his abusers. Also makes for bittersweet fluff at the end of <em>Ink Exchange</em> when Irial, ruler of the dark fey, who also commanded Gabriel and the other dark fey to do what they did, kisses him on the scar on his face. They were lovers, once. Before the mortals, before the rape, before everything bad happened. But Niall's scars, both emotional and physical, serve as tangible proof of why they can never be that way again. The one on his face, at least, is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">Wound That Will Not Heal</a> when he isn't wearing a glamour.

Creb lost an arm and an eye and has a horribly scarred face because he was attacked by a cave bear. Jondalar has the scars on his inner thigh after being mauled by a cave lion, which incidentally indicates that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGuyWins">the right mate</a> for Ayla.

Hertzler refused, feeling that his character would never remove a battle scar. The writers went ahead and put that refusal in the script!

Such injuries could only heal naturally and would leave "battle scars" which could only be removed by magical healing rituals. Especially nasty scars could permanently cripple a werewolf warrior, but were also considered a mark of glory, and having them removed was considered shameful.

Scars do dull over time but never disappear. By the end of the game, it's almost certain that your Hero's face and body is going to be a patchwork of faded slashes and cuts. The only way to avoid this is to use Physical Shield to avoid major injuries altogether.

For some reason, despite being able to grow back arms, legs, and eyes, his skin recovers by forming scar tissue. Although the graphics make this hard to tell, in-game explanations imply that The Nameless One effectively has no skin left on his body, just overlapping scar tissue. It would certainly explain his grey skin tone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At one point, you can actually find a severed arm from one of his past lives.

However, the game opens with him and his rival Seifer both getting their scars on the same day as the game's events begin, so for once it actually makes sense for them to still sport them since the game only takes place over a short time period. However, the trademark scars they share are so iconic they are even present for their very different roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>,</em> and we are given no explanation for how either got them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mbw3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mbw3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mbw3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Squall is a survivor of a Heartless-torn world, but Seifer is a town bully in a world with <em>no sharp weapons</em>, so...</span> so this trope is present in a meta sense.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> series tells us that Cammy chooses not to have her scar removed because it reminds her of who she is.
<ul><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> however, the scar is noticeably less visible.
</li></ul></li><li> Abel from SFIV has several scars across his body, probably coming from his mercenary days.

The only thing holding him together is the power of the Dark Side.
</li><li> During a knife fight cutscene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, Leon suffers a cut on his face that remains until the end of the game. Krauser has this more noticeably due to the fact Leon cut him across the front of his chest and he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">Shirtless Scene</a> later on, plus the multitude of scars across his face from the helicopter accident he survived.
</li><li> During the trickle of information for the week leading up to the Sniper/Spy class update in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, Valve released the eighth in their Meet The Team series of videos, Meet The Spy, where one scene has the Spy give the Sniper a cut across the face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">shortly before killing him with a backstab</a>. When the update was released, the Sniper had gained a scar across his face.
</li><li> Duster the thief of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> has a limp throughout the course of the game. It is implied that Wess's intensive thief training had rendered this injury upon Duster.
</li><li> Xiahou Dun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> got his eyepatch like this: When he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">arrow'd in the eye</a> during the course of battle, he plucked it out, along with the arrow. And ate it.
</li><li> Depending on player preference, any version of Commander Shepard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> can have a fairly prominent scar, gained during the decisive events of his or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a> (although the selection of scars available for female Shepards are overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished">less prominent</a> than the ones available to males). The sequel, meanwhile, plays around with the trope; when Shepard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is killed and restored to life</span>, the process removes any facial scars he or she already had, and leaves him or her with a whole new set. These can either heal away completely in a relatively short space of time, or become even more pronounced if Shepard allows his or her aggressive tendencies to aggravate them.
<ul><li> Zaeed has a huge scar and a discolored eye from when he was shot in the head at point-blank range and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">managed to survive through sheer badassery</a>. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Mordin</a> has a prominent X-shaped scar on one side of his face and half a cranial horn missing. Jack also noticeably has a number of scars mixed in with her full-body tattoos.
</li><li> Garrus Vakarian takes a missile to the face, and boy does it leave a mark. This trope applies to his armour too, which he leaves damaged, presumably to make him even more intimidating.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Wrex</a> is implied to have received his scars from his father <em>over a thousand years ago</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Jack</a> still has the scars from Cerberus' experiments and her life of crime, though they're hard to see under the tattoos.

</li></ul></li><li> Most significant characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> are robots, giving ample room for head-scratching over this trope. Zero has been repaired after being torn into three pieces with nary a telltale scratch. The purple-black scars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">burned into Sigma's eyes</a>, however, persist throughout all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">bodies</a> he uses.
<ul><li> Given his personality, Sigma likely sees them as symbolic of his war and has them purposefully added to his new faces.
</li><li> Axl's shapeshifting works by copying the DNA (read: blueprints) of his targets, but somehow his morphs bear scars which his targets had (most notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red's missing eye</span>) and his own scars have never healed. He doesn't have them when using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">his White Armor</a> in <em>X8</em>, although it's not clear whether this is relevant to the plot.
</li><li> Another prominent example is Bass.exe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em>. Being a Net Navi, and therefore made of data, he could have repaired that scar across his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestInsignia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestInsignia">Navi Symbol</a> any time he liked, but he got it in the first place when The Official Net Battlers were sent to delete him due to the (false) belief that he was the one responsible for the damage caused by the Alpha Rebellion, and he was told the decision to delete him was unanimous among Sci Lab's scientists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">which included his own creator.</a> So he keeps the scar, to symbolize this betrayal and to remind him why he thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Desmond Miles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> games has a scar on his lip that the Animus transfers to both ancestors.
<ul><li> Ezio gets his from a rock thrown at him at the very beginning of the story. Throughout the next 20 years depicted in the game, it stays visible. In the time between Sequence 13 (one of the DLCs) and 14, Ezio grows a beard, which makes the scar even more visible since the scar stops hair from growing in that spot.
</li><li> Altaïr's scar is visible to Ezio in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Revelations</a> and he doesn't use an animus to see Altaïr's memories. It seems to be just a coincidence that all three have the same scar.
</li><li> One might assume that the scar is there to link all of Desmond's ancestors. However, neither Haytham nor Connor nor Edward has the mouth scar (although Edward has multiple others). On the other hand, Aveline, who is not known to be linked to Desmond's line, has the same mouth scar.
</li><li> Much like Aveline, Bayek of Siwa has the same mouth scar again, without any known link to Desmond's ancestry.
</li></ul></li><li> John Marston of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> is actually a pretty nice guy (especially considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> he lives in), and it would be easy to forget that he's a violent outlaw if not for his facial scars serving as a constant reminder of the kind of life he's led.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitTheDog">Kazuya Mishima</a> has had a very distinct and large scar on his chest since the first game, gained as a child from when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father, Heihaci, threw him off a mountain</a>. He got his revenge on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Heihachi</a> at the end of Tekken 1, but at the end of the 2nd game, he was thrown into a volcano by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">father and actually died...</a> but came back in the fourth game, baring even more scars on his face and body. Seeing as he may be more evil than ever, it may represent his further corruption by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Devil</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity">Pillars of Eternity</a></em>, Iovara's face remains burned even in spirit form, after her soul has spent countless years in Sun in Shadow.

It's possible that we're seeing her <em>after</em> they tried fixing them. The scars are still an inflamed-looking purplish-red, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> despite the house fire that gave her the scars happening 8 or 9 years ago, at least.</span>
<ul><li> Hisao himself has a scar on his chest from when he had surgery on his heart. In Shizune's route, in which he never explicitly tells her about his condition, during the first sex scene, he's relieved that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightThroughHisPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightThroughHisPants">they're able to have sex without taking off his shirt</a>, so that she won't have to see it. He also uses the scar to show Hanako that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> in her route, and when Lilly runs her hand over this scar during her first sex scene in her route, she becomes concerned about whether sexual activity is healthy for Hisao.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> also deserves note, as Shiki possesses a gigantic wound in his chest from the 'accident' that gave him his Eyes of Death. Like Kenshin, this wound heals up when the story is complete and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He kills Roa/SHIKI</span>.

While being a Bad Ass of high caliber to boot, his personal schtick was that not only do any wounds he inflicts invariably cause ugly scars, but most of them remain permanently open even in the face of white magic. As the Trope describes above, the character most afflicted with one of these wounds wore it as an external symbol of the depravity in his soul that he had fallen into ever since it was inflicted.
<ul><li> Szark Sturtz, owner of one of the grievous example above, has only managed to get it closed when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karnak became the King of Hell, and only then because it has since been assumed that he's now got so many new powers to play with that he can't be bothered to keep track of them all</span>.

<ul><li> Given she was — and technically still <em>is</em> — stuck inside a prison, access to limb-regenerating technology is likely not an option.

Niall is able to heal himself with very little traces, but from some angles, even the more than a decade old scars on his face are visible. He is also quite aware that he looks horrible with a body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars">Covered in Scars</a>, and mistakenly believes that it makes him appear entirely unappetizing.

Justified given that it's specifically stated that the reason it won't heal is specifically said to be magic. Additionally, his fur (The curse of Metamor turned Charles into an anthropomorphic rat) will not grow back in that spot. The scar is frequently used in artwork of the series.

<ul><li> Weiss has a scar over her left eye (the eye itself is intact). The White Trailer shows her receiving it in battle against a giant animated suit of armor, though there is some doubt as to the context of that scene, or even whether that scene actually happened or was just a metaphor. It is eventually revealed that it was a test her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father</a> forced her to undergo in order to prove that she could attend Beacon. Note that Beacon already has its own combat test; this was just her father putting more obstacles in her path because she was trying to go to a distant school rather than a closer one where he could control her.

<ul><li> Zuko's iconic burn scar, as shown in the page image.

</li><li> Another example in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> is Aang's scar, incurred when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azula shoots him in the center of the spine <em>with lightning</em></span>. Even if it is on his back (where it could be easily concealed), the writers still take plenty of opportunities to remind us that, yes, Aang has a huge scar on his back. He also has a scar on the bottom of his foot, from the same injury. This is also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a> since real lightning strike victims often have the electrical current exit through their feet.

</li><li> Hudson on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> has a scar through one eye, giving his eye a permanent yellow color. He got it fighting the Archmage, who blasted him into a rock inside a cave. Gargoyles heal from most injuries when they turn to stone, but it isn't explained why his scar never healed despite this fact.
<ul><li> Word of God says that some types of injuries (loss of limbs etc.) cannot be healed even by stone sleep, and apparently losing the use of an eye falls into this category.
</li><li> The scars on Gillecomgain's face, from when Demona struck him as a child, remained until his death some 40 years later.

<ul><li> Possibly caused by whatever turned him blue, since neither scar nor color was present during the college years flashback.

How this happened is a mystery, even to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Edward Kay</a>, who only states that it adds to her twisted appearance. In the original idea for the series, she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who was gunned down, so that scar was due to the fact a bullet hit her there. As they (probably) changed everything about that idea, the scar was just left there for the above reasons.
</li><li> Played straight and averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>. Dick Knubbler loses both eyes at the end of his debut episode and needs cybernetic replacements. Dr. Twinkletits gets similar replacements for his arms (and apparently larynx), which were eaten by wolves. However, Dr. Rockzo's nose falls off at the end of 'Cleanzo', and it seems fine next time we see him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Ofdensen returns from his faked death, he has a scar on his cheek that vanishes by the next episode.</span>

He uses a metal replacement. Billy Quizboy lost an eye and a hand and uses an eyepatch and prosthetic. He originally had a convincing prosthetic eye but lost it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Phantom Limb needs prosthetics after the Season 2 finale, as well.</span>

</li><li> Similarly, Leonardo in the same series (at least prior to Fast Forward) lost a segment of his shell which never healed.
</li><li> This became almost a running gag with Baxter Stockman: he gradually lost more and more of his body as the series progressed (for example, first his eye, then his <em>legs</em>, and so on). By the end of season 2, he's just a brain with one eye in a jar.

While walking on the beach, a large, monstrous fish suddenly jumps out of the water and tries to drag Sadie in. They manage to kill it, giving them food for the night, but Sadie gets a number of cuts, including a small one under her eye that never fully heals (oddly, the much deeper bite marks on her arm do).
</li><li> Even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his resurrection</span> cured some serious injuries (broken bones, ruptured organs), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lars</span> still sports a giant scar over his right eye from when he was hit with shrapnel from an explosion.
</li><li> For a certain definition of "scar," anytime a gem gets poofed, the form she regenerates with is the one she's stuck with until she's poofed again. Any injuries that aren't severe enough to poof will heal, but anything inherent to the regeneration is stuck. Best demonstrated by Amethyst in the episode "Reformed," where she rushes a regeneration and winds up with horribly misshapen limbs, and later, more subtly, after being poofed by Jasper and again rushing a regeneration, she has one eye in a perpetual squint.
</li></ul></li><li> Panthro from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">ThunderCats</a></em> reboot has a noticeable scar from his right eye.
