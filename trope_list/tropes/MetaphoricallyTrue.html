One way to make this trope work is to play with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>, but particularly bad cases may require a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalDictionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalDictionary">Personal Dictionary</a> or outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool">Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School</a></em>, during the <em>Future</em> arc, Kazuo exclaims to Munakata that the traitor within the group (who kills someone after every time limit) is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone, because despite their attempts to hold onto hope, they're still capable of falling into despair.

</li><li> Most things said by Xelloss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> is technically true in manner in which he phrased it, though not always in the manner in which the listener chooses to hear it. For example, he introduces himself as "Xelloss, the mysterious priest!" After that statement, the "mysterious" part is in no way questioned. As to "priest", in the mazoku hierarchy Xelloss' rank is <em>actually</em> "priest". Mazoku Lords are typically served by a priest and a general. Xelloss claims the former title although he is the sole representative of his Lord. He is using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSpeak">tell people</a> that he is one of the top ten mazoku in the entire world in terms of power. Played for laughs when it turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Gourry</a> actually got this, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">thought it was so obvious</a> he assumed that everyone did.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>, what Kyubey tells to Kyoko when asked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if Sayaka could be turned back into a human after having turned into a witch</span> is technically not meant to say that it is possible... But the way he phrases it doesn't make it look <em>impossible</em> either. This gives Kyoko enough hope to try, and ultimately results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyoko having to sacrifice herself to put Witch!Sayaka out of her misery</span> when it doesn't work. Later on, Kyubey acknowledges that he phrased his statement that way because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he wanted Kyoko to die</span>, so that Homura <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was left with no companions to fend off the ultimate witch, Walpurgis Night, when it appears, unless Madoka accepts a Puella Magi contract</span>. In general, Kyubey is made of this; he never actually <em>lies</em>, he just withholds any relevant information unless specifically asked about it.
</li><li> Everything Ryuk says in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is true. The problem is that he <em>never</em> gives you the entire context. Like him telling Light that humans who use the Death Note cannot go to neither Heaven nor Hell <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actually means there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">no afterlife for anyone</a></span>. Though Light already figured that to be the case on his own.
<ul><li> Subverted in two alternate endings. In one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Light ends up a Shinigami. In the other, he's sent to a place WORSE than Hell. The Shinigami realm, where he has to relive every death he caused, THEN cease to exist. He takes it in stride. It gives him enough time to kill the Shinigami King</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Schneizel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> uses this to such great effect, it's scary.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> manga, Honda/Tristan enlists the help of Yugi and Jonouchi/Joey to confess his feelings to a classmate.

Adrien (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Chat Noir himself</a>) is listening in on the conversation, and both he and Marinette have rather hilarious reactions to Juleka suggesting that she get him neutered.

While that is true, it doesn't mean she isn't in love with anyone. Elsa asks her if Kyra'd tell her if she was in love with someone, to which Kyra replies that Elsa would be the first if she decided to reveal her feelings or someone. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">half-true</a> as is Elsa the object of her affections.

He also outright lies about how painful it was. It wasn't painless, it was <em>excruciating.</em>
<ul><li> When his mother finally confronts him about his self-experimentation, he agrees to talk to her about it before doing any more to reassure her, conveniently leaving out the fact that he's already installed everything he's wanted to already.

Izuku meekly replies that he just needed help, leaving out Toshinori's and One For All's role in his sudden empowerment.

More specifically, before the girls besides Homura become aware of the truth, he talks about how Key is mentally ill and how much he wants to help him. Hes not lying since, from his perspective, Key is mentally ill and needs correction. Key disagrees . . . vehemently.
</li><li> When Harry asks Sam what he does for a living in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CrossCases" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CrossCases">Cross Cases</a></em>, Sam says he's a librarian. It's an adequate description of his position as a Man of Letters, but it omits his other gig as a hunter of the supernatural, and ultimately gets Harry more suspicious of him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Harry, narrating:</strong> "I didnt buy the librarian thing for a second- what librarian is built like a brick wall, moves like a hunting cat, and carries a knife and a gun?"

He's wearing the uniform because he makes him look fabulous, it's both his uniform and not his uniform, and that he won't get into trouble wearing it because he can do anything he wants as long as he sets his mind to it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith, and so has no superiors to report to. It's his uniform because he designed it and it belongs to him, but it's not his uniform because he doesn't have the job that requires the uniform. And he won't get into trouble with the Sith for wearing the uniform because he's the boss. Also, the Force contrives to help him a lot anyways.</span>

<ul><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> used this in the direct-to-video conclusion of the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinAndTheKingOfThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinAndTheKingOfThieves">Aladdin and the King of Thieves</a></em>. An oracle tells Aladdin that his father, Cassim, is trapped within the world of the Forty Thieves. Well, he is. It's just that Cassim is not only there voluntarily, he's their leader, and what he's trapped by is his own greed.
</li><li> In yet another Disney example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook">The Jungle Book</a></em> sees Kaa telling Mowgli that he can help him: "I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle." Considering that Kaa's "help" would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eating Mowgli</a>, the snake technically isn't lying  once the boy is devoured, he <em>can't</em> leave the jungle. Or do anything else, for that matter.
</li><li> Before actually meeting Po, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tai Lung</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> describes him as "a warrior...unlike anything the world has ever seen". This is <em>technically</em> true, just not in the way Tai Lung thought. He assumed Po was something akin to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a>, when in truth, Po is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatComicRelief">exact</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero">opposite</a></em> (before he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, of course).

This is not technically <em>untrue</em>, as Mufasa was killed trying to save his son from the stampede <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(though he would have survived if Scar himself had not thrown him off a cliff into the raging herd)</span>, but Scar's words make poor Simba think that he was somehow <em>responsible</em> for his father's death, which, Scar being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> that he is, is precisely what he desires.

While the good doctor had strongly implied he foresaw the money Naveen wanted in order to do as he pleases, he actually intended to pull the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> card and turn him into a frog (and does).

This is actually true, Harvey Dent died from a fall after Batman shoved him off a roof, but it leaves out the important part: he did so because Harvey/Two-Face was about to kill Commissioner Gordon's son.
</li><li> In the non-canon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> movie <em>Shinichi Kudo Returns! Showdown with the Black Organization</em>, Ran sees Ai Haibara hugging Shinichi (both temporarily at their normal ages) and becomes suspicious and jealous. To calm her down, Ai gives a fake name and claims that she'd hired Shinichi to help her with some dangerous men who were trying to get revenge on her for something, and that she was hugging him out of fear. Technically that's true - she was being pursued by Gin and Vodka, both of them wanted revenge on her for escaping them, Shinichi was helping save her from them, and she really <em>had</em> been hugging him out of fear.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortApache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortApache">Fort Apache</a></em> reporters are interviewing now Colonel York about the upcoming military campaign and mention the painting in Washington of the previous CO's, Thursday, charge against the Apaches. York replies that the description the reporter gives is correct in every detail. The obvious inference is that the painting is an accurate description of the battle, which the viewer already knows is untrue, and York is lying to the reporter. However, it could be taken to be his commenting on the reporter's description of the painting, which is accurate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InsideMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InsideMan">Inside Man</a></em>, Dalton Russel's opening monologue is phrased so that it sounds like his bank robbery failed and he is in jail. However, he warns the listener, "Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself." And at the very end of the movie, we find out that Dalton has actually spent the last three days imprisoned inside the bank's inner walls as part of his scheme, and the scheme itself comes off perfectly.

The point is really moot, as almost any jurisdiction would consider putting somebody in such a situation to be murder. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII">Saw II</a></em> does at least have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> detective hero calls Jigsaw out on this defense: "putting a gun to someone's head and forcing him to pull the trigger is still murder." Plus, that ignores the very first movie, in which Jigsaw lures Detective Sing into a hallway and into a shotgun trap, resulting in his death, which was preceded by a very straightforward attempt to murder Detective Tapp by cutting his throat.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, wherein Obi-Wan tells Luke that the statement "Darth Vader betrayed and murdered your father" is, indeed, true "from a certain point of view." This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>, but it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">pretty good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>. It's true that Vader killed loads of Jedi and other innocent people, including very young children, it's true that Obi-Wan feels betrayed and horrified and hates what Anakin became for it, and it's believable that the old man wouldn't want to immediately tell Luke that his dad is actually an evil Sith Lord who killed his mother and is the main enforcer of the despotic regime that Luke hates (for Luke's sake, if for no other reason). Further helping things is that Sir Alec Guinness' acting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> manages to convey, likely though simple good luck, that Obi-Wan isn't being entirely truthful with Luke; in particular, take notice of how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesitationEqualsDishonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesitationEqualsDishonesty">briefly hesitates</a> when Luke asks what happened to his father. You can practically see him asking himself what would be the best thing for him to say. That hesitation is amazingly lucky for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>.
<ul><li> It was originally intended that Obi-Wan <em>was</em> telling the whole truth — in the first draft of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeighBrackett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeighBrackett">Leigh Brackett</a>, Luke's father even appears as a Force ghost. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> introduced the twist in the second draft, which he wrote after Brackett's death, as a way of improving character motivations.
</li></ul></li><li> Incidentally, Luke learns to use this metaphorical truth later on to guilt trip Vader in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> when the former allows himself to be captured. During their confrontation, it's clear Luke is getting under Vader's skin and the latter admits Luke essentially has points but says he doesn't have much of a choice in following Palpatine. As a sort of last low blow before he's taken away, Luke is clearly disappointed in him and tells him "then my father is truly dead". It's not clear whether this means Luke came around to Obi-Wan's perspective of it, at least for that moment, or that it was just to burn Vader one more time. Either way, it works, and Vader is clearly shaken and hurt that his son would tell him his "father" — not just "Anakin" — is truly dead.
</li><li> While this looks weaselly, it does fit later hints that the Jedi see the Sith as something like the walking dead, former people who've been turned into monsters by the Dark Side. Mace Windu says "which was <em>destroyed</em>, the master or the apprentice?" — not, say, <em>slain</em>. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon referred to Darth Maul as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">it</a>", while Yoda later warns Obi-Wan that Anakin is "gone" and has been "consumed" by Darth Vader — a line probably written for the purpose of bolstering the point-of-view of Obi-Wan's original statement to Luke. Even more so, throughout the final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin, you can see Obi-Wan constantly trying to reach his friend and former apprentice and bring him back to his senses. It's only by the end of the fight where he seems to come to the conclusion that his friend is no more. It's likely the same train of thought Luke had in the above capture scene later on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> further supports this idea, with Kylo Ren <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">saying that he destroyed his former identity.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ewbh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ewbh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ewbh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Strictly speaking Kylo isn't a Sith; he's deliberately invoking this trope as part of his Darth Vader obsession.</span>
<ul><li> Darth Vader himself says the same thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">to his former apprentice</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E20TwilightOfTheApprenticePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E20TwilightOfTheApprenticePartII">Twilight of the Apprentice, Part II</a>".
<div class="indent"><strong>Vader:</strong> Anakin Skywalker was weak. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">I destroyed him</a>. <br/><strong>Ahsoka:</strong> Then I will avenge his death!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, after Anakin stands up in the Vader suit for the first time, his first question to Sidious is "Where's Padmé?", having last seen her unconscious after force-choking her. Sidious replies that in his anger Anakin had killed her. This has the desired effect of driving Anakin to despair so that he will embrace the Dark Side more closely. It is, however <em>technically</em> true, insofar as Anakin's betrayal ultimately causes Padmé to lose the will to live, to say nothing of the aforementioned force choke — something that Sidious was probably aware of.
<ul><li> According to the novelization it's literally true, and she died from internal damage caused by the choke; the robots that gave the "lost the will to live" explanation are just terrible doctors.
</li><li> The junior novel even has Sidious internally reflecting on this, taking pleasure in the fact that he won't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">even need to lie</a> in order to break Vader's spirit.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sidious</strong>: 'And now for the final touch. The words that will forever bind him to the dark side. They won't even be a lie. Not really.'
</div></li><li> Anakin himself turns out to be not much better than Obi-Wan at this when he tries convincing Padmé over to his side, saying that the Jedi were taking over the Republic and that he saw Mace Windu try to assassinate the Chancellor. Conveniently leaving out the part about Palpatine being a Sith Lord who has been plotting to take over the galaxy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda">He does, however, tell her that he plans to overthrow him so that they can rule the galaxy together themselves, and probably do a better job at it than Palpatine would.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> A second Obi Wan example concerns R2-D2. When Luke says the R2 claims to belong to Obi Wan he responds "I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid". This is technically correct since R2 was never actually his property but leaves out the fact that he knows exactly who R2 is and who he does belong to.
</li><li> In one of the first lines in the entire saga, Raymus Antilles tells Vader that the <em>Tantive IV</em> did not intercept any transmissions of the stolen Death Star plans. Forty years later, we learn this to be technically true; in the final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> (2016), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leia receives the plans in a physical format. It also makes Vader's phrasing odd, since he was present at the time</span>.
<ul><li> However, Vader may have simply viewed it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctionWithoutADifference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctionWithoutADifference">Distinction Without a Difference</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> When Yoda is dying, he tells Luke that "the last of the Jedi, you will be." However, in Legends there was plenty of other surviving Jedi. Some had fallen to the Dark side, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII">Jerec</a>, so they arguably are no longer count as Jedi. However, other Jedi were merely in hiding. Some came out of hiding to help Luke reestablish the Jedi Order. In Canon, the statement currently closer to the truth, as the only other known survivor of Order 66 alive at the time of Return of the Jedi, namely Asoka, directly stated that she is not a Jedi.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, Kylo Ren claims that part of the reason he turned to the Dark Side was that Luke tried to kill him in his sleep. When confronted about this, Luke admits that he almost did after already sensing the darkness within him, but stopped himself at the last minute. The problem was that Kylo had already woken up and saw him with his lightsaber still on, so he of course retaliated in self-defense. As far as they're all concerned, Kylo wasn't so much lying as he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">simply explaining what he saw through his own perspective</a>, and it's not like he would've been able to tell the difference.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, Kylo Ren tells Rey her parents were nobodies, filthy junk traders who abandoned and sold her off for drinking money and died. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>, while he claims to have never lied to her, he also tells her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her parents chose to be junk-trader nobodies, in spite of having a background that implied otherwise, and abandoned her in order to protect her from being found by her <em>grandfather</em> who is very much a somebody. Selling her for drinking money was part of the cover they used to drop her off and throw off the assassin who was after her and they died keeping the truth from said assassin</span>. To be fair, it's implied he didn't know that part anyway until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Palpatine apparently told him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsLoveGotToDoWithIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsLoveGotToDoWithIt">What's Love Got to Do with It</a></em>, Tina Turner is shown as reduced to a lounge act, implying this is what she's reduced to make ends meet and showing how far she fell before her big come back with the eponymous album. The film neglects to mention a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> detail: When this happened to the real Turner, it was her idea, to make sure people knew she hadn't retired or vanished since her infamously nasty split with Ike Turner.

</li><li> Garry King from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd">The World's End</a></em> almost entirely speaks in this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>. He often makes plans in the loosest and most roundabout way, so that he never <em>technically</em> breaks them, and it's a running gag that he's "never wrong". Not "always right", "never wrong". It's futile to argue with the man sober, let alone drunk.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em>, Logan goes to Charles' school to find him, but he is greeted by Hank, who says that there are no professors in the place. Logan believes correctly that he is lying, as Charles eventually appears there. However, he is so broken and enraged that he doesn't resemble his usual self anymore. Hank reaffirms that there are no professors in the school.

Suffice it to say that there's plenty of debate over when/, if it's always wrong to lie, especially considering that the verse often quoted as "Thou shalt not lie" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">actually says</a> "Thou shalt not <em>bear false witness against thy neighbor</em>", which is a lot more ambiguous.

Technically speaking, they're not guilty of actual murder — they didn't shoot or poison their victims — but their actions did lead to their eventual deaths, which leads a mysterious murderer to administer a twisted form of law on them:
<ul><li> Anthony Marston, a young, carefree, attractive man, ran over two children in his car. He's the only member of the group who actually directly killed an individual, though he did so unknowingly; the murderer kills him first because Marston himself isn't haunted by guilt, and the killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames">wants the victims to squirm</a>.

</li><li> In a novel by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertECowdrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertECowdrey">Albert E Cowdrey</a>, a megalomaniacal criminal wants revenge on the human race for his imprisonment. Before he's allowed out of prison, he's asked a few questions, and there's a machine that can tell whether he's telling the truth or not. When asked if he regrets his behavior, he says yes (meaning he regrets that his mistakes got him caught). When asked if he wants to harm anyone or something like that, he says "I do not wish to harm any human individual."

When asked the source of his wealth, he prefers to reply that he does some martial arts training and various circumstances for the government, as well as some fieldwork before his daughter is born. If he's asked whether he means the Hong Kong or continental Chinese government, he says "above either," generally taken to mean he's with the UN. Inevitably, people assume he's a spy, and to THAT question he says he can't discuss it. In fact, he's a god in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">Celestial Bureaucracy</a> and being, amongst other things, the god of martial arts, he spends a lot of time teaching it to other gods.

He also swears that the king will not die by their hands. What he omits is that the spears were used to pin the king's arms and legs to a tree, and his belly was sliced to allow his entrails to be pulled out and hung on the branches to attract predators. The food was also left for this purpose. To be fair, the king deserved this.

It's often weaponized, both to fool people, and by deliberately challenging what someone has said, sometimes leading to duels over bending the truth. For example, Duncan Behaim told Blake that he could keep him in the police station until midnight. Blake manages to leap out a window, thus making Duncan a liar... except that he'd bled quite a bit beforehand, so technically some of Blake was still inside the station.
</li><li> Many practitioner societies keep one or more people on hand who never Awaken, purely so that they can lie to others.

They went around saying all kinds of technically true things about water (things like "its a chemical solvent", which is true, and "over six thousand people are killed by this stuff in the US every year", which is also true) while making it sound like a toxin.

</li><li> The original trope name could just has easily been called Vulcan Truth instead of Jedi Truth. Vulcans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">always</a> honest, except when they're deceiving, misleading, or flat out lying.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original series</a> episode "The <em>Enterprise</em> Incident", Spock explains to the Romulan Commander that the Vulcan reputation for being truthful is overblown. They'll lie just like anyone else if they have a [logical] reason to.
</li><li> In one early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, Tuvok tells Chakotay that he is always honest, to which Chakotay points out that he wasn't being honest when he pretended to be a Maquis in order to infiltrate Chakotay's ship. Tuvok then counters that he was being honest to his principles and within the defined parameters of his mission. Chakotay recognizes this as a load of crap.
</li><li> In another episode, he flat out lies to intimidate a prisoner. Janeway bluffs that she is gonna send the prisoner off to some people she's scammed (the prisoner, not Janeway). She asks Tuvok to tell her about the conditions of that world's prisons, and Tuvok wildly invents a tale of deplorable conditions where most prisoners don't survive long enough to be put on trial. The prisoner knows just enough about Vulcans to believe the story that they never lie, so she caves in.
</li><li> The trick is that in both these cases, Tuvok had a perfectly logical reason to lie. We might reasonably assume that most Vulcans would not lie, for example, to spare a friend's feelings (from the Vulcan perspective, allowing emotions to influence a decision is illogical), or get out of a tedious duty (the duty needs to be done, so procrastination would be illogical), and other species would remember those instances of honesty as unusual, even extreme. Vulcans (clearly) have the capacity to lie if the situation warrants it, they just won't do it unless there's a logical reason why it's necessary; since most lies that a human would tell wouldn't be necessary from a Vulcan point of view, it gives the (not quite correct) impression that Vulcans don't or can't lie.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Pro Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most undefeated streaks in pro wrestling are eventually handled this way. This is due to several bits of logic. For one, long undefeated streaks don't just happen in a vacuum: they're either created with the intent to build a wrestler up as a juggernaut of some sort or they're eventually noticed by the bookers and used in such a way. The idea is that fans, for one reason or another, should be wondering when and by whom he/she will finally get beaten, as well as come to accept him/her as a championship threat whether the plan is to ever put a title on the wrestler or not. However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>, any wrestler that goes undefeated for a long period of time would have to be put in championship title picture situations; there's no logical justification for an authority figure not to do this. In fact, by logical extreme, if someone does nothing but wrestle and win on a regular basis for a long period of time, there's no way they shouldn't hold at least one championship in hand. <br/><br/>So wrestling companies have created an alternate logic, where if you lose a match that involves retrieving an object, or you lose a tag team match or a match with three or more participants and you're not the one to eat the pin or get forced to submit, or even if you get yourself disqualified in a match (especially if you're a heel), you're still technically undefeated. This allows a wrestler to avoid swallowing up everyone else's momentum, to lose title matches, or even to win and lose championships outright, without losing the allure of the question as to who will finally take them down.

Freelancer Michael Goodwin explicitly said that "There are levels of Obi-Wan truth operating here." In fairness, nearly everything about the Fair Folk is a lie on some level, up to and including their physical appearance.
</li><li> In another rather similar case — "Infernals don't have Charms." What was really meant was, "Their <em>patrons</em>, the Yozi, have Charms, which the Infernals use by extension to exert their malefic will upon Creation." Not true anymore, either.

And secondly in his promise of comfort to George: "I will deliver you, or else lie for you." The obvious meaning is that he will lie in prison in George's place; but the true meaning is that he will lie in wait for George's life.

Indeed, their self-serving tendencies of filtering truth through "certain points of view" is significantly responsible for their eventual downfall.
<ul><li> In the first game, on the other hand, the only real example of this trope is Jolee's claim that "the Jedi left me" (and he doesn't consider himself a Jedi any more at this point).

The trailer shows the player character fighting a pair of elderly civilians, a familiar antagonistic person, and then it's followed by a supporting character appearing to fend off a major villain.

<ul><li> All of the movies in the game are not inherently wrong in their settings; they follow the tropes of their genres strictly. It's just that they are derailed and twisted into perverse versions of what they actually are.
<ul><li> <em>Kamoshidaman</em> is a superhero movie about a superhero punishing evil in the city and fighting villains...except that the "superhero" decides who is evil and who isn't, and anyone who opposes or disagrees with him are the evil villains threatening his city. To make things worse, he bullies his citizens into absolute submission by silencing all critique.

</li><li> The fourth movie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mixes elements of a biopic and a musical, and it surely appears as cheery as a standard musical; It's just that all of its lyrics are about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">Loss of Identity</a> and it depicts a biopic of someone getting their life ruined instead of a success story</span>.

Much like Zen in the prequel, she genuinely wishes for the happiness of the people that she protects from pain and suffering; she just does it by having them watch movies of pure negativity with absolutely no encouraging morals and positivity, with all of the people they depict being portrayed as failures in an unsympathetic fashion</span>.

For example, in most routes, Seteth will claim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edelgard took the Imperial throne in a bloodless coup</span>. This isn't wrong, but playing that character's route will reveal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edelgard politely asked her terminally ill father to hand over power, which he did willingly; Edelgard then promptly arrested any dissidents because she's acutely aware how little she could trust her own court, hence the "coup" rumor</span>.
<ul><li> This crops up with respect to historical events as well, largely because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seiros has been massaging the truth of the War Of Heroes and Crests to protect the last few Nabateans. To make matters worse, the only other source of information on events back then, "those who slither in the dark", do the same, but they're intentionally deceptive.</span> For example, Edelgard states on her route that the Heroes' Relics are not gifts from the Goddess and were made by human hands. This is true, but it leaves out one very big detail that is only revealed on the Golden Deer route: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Relics were made from <em>the bones of the Nabateans</em>, who were massacred entirely for this purpose, and the humans who created them were backed by "those who slither in the dark".</span>

Rean does feel bad about it later and does come clean (he's adopted by nobles but as far as Rean knows at the time, he was a commoner) but to Machias, he felt that he was lied to.

Frampt says your destiny is to succeed Gwyn while Kaathe says it's to replace him. While either option at the end is <em>technically</em> true, succeeding Gwyn requires burning yourself alive as fuel for the Kiln of the First Flame and replacing him means taking up the mantle of the Dark Lord for the Age of Dark, despite the fact that Kaathe's guidance is what led to the destruction of New Londo to begin with.

One of the prisoners, after screwing up and getting executed by overthinking her answers, learns in the next playthrough that she can outwit the lie detectors by half-truths that are deliberately worded to mislead the listeners: for example, she can say "I cared for someone disabled" and not set off her lie detector even though the "someone" she referred to was a cat who was "disabled" by declawing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, <em>all</em> the prisoners constantly tell half-truths throughout the game: the prisoner who's actually an undercover cop manages to make it sound like she committed robbery and attempted murder (when she was only <em>at</em> the robbery as part of the police force and the person she tried to shoot was the robber) and the one prisoner who's actually guilty of her crime makes it sound like she's innocent (when she's only "innocent" in the sense that she was cleared of charges for that crime).</span>

Of course, this has lead to a <em>lot</em> of people getting hurt or killed because he refuses to reveal the entire truth. For instance, in the Volume 6 premiere, he warns the team of how powerful and dangerous the Relic of Knowledge is. He just never bothered to reveal <em>how</em> it's dangerous: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it attracts Grimm like a moth to a flame</span>. This lack of exposition ended badly for the heroes.

One by saying that the <strong>five</strong> of them had never left their cells (because Durkon had stayed behind), then claiming that the cell door wasn't secure because of a mechanical defect (if you count "being able to be picked by a rogue" as a mechanical defect).
</li><li> O-Chul pulls one too. When asked by Hinjo if he made the decision to destroy Soon's gate, he answers he did make that decision, and it was his blade that did the deed, and he will say no more lest he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">speak ill of the dead</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After making said decision, the tide of the battle turned and it was no longer required.

</li><li> There's a later subversion with the Oracle. Belkar's asked if he would get to cause the death of one of the following: Roy, Miko, Miko's horse, Vaarsuvius or the Oracle himself. The Oracle simply responds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">"Yes"</a> without ever saying which. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">On Belkar's return visit, the Oracle claims this prophecy has already been fulfilled. He argues, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">increasingly dubious logic</a>, that Belkar caused the death of Roy, (a <em>somewhat</em> plausible argument) then also that he indirectly caused Miko's death, (really reaching for that one) and that he killed Miko's horse (which is complete BS). Belkar finally loses patience and fulfills the prophecy then and there — by stabbing the Oracle to death. The dying Oracle then reveals that he didn't actually believe any of the stuff he was spouting, he was just trying to weasel out of being stabbed (though fortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a>).</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Doc Scratch:</strong> Lies of omission do not exist. The concept is a very human one. It is the product of your story writing again. You have written a story about the truth, making emotional demands of it, and in particular, of those in possession of it. Your demands are based on a feeling of entitlement to the facts, which is very childish. You can never know all of the facts. Only I can. And since it's impossible for me to reveal all facts to you, it is my discretion alone that decides which facts will be revealed in the finite time we have. If I do not volunteer information you deem critical to your fate, it possibly means that I am a scoundrel, but it does not mean that I am a liar. And it certainly means you did not ask the right questions. One can make either true statements or false statements about reality. All of the statements I make are true.

</li><li> A large number of proposition bets used by grifters can be solved by looking very carefully at the wording. For example, "I bet you that I can take a brand new deck of cards, make the ace jump out of the pack and fly across the room, then write your name on your forehead." If you hear this said aloud, most people assume that the ace will do all of the actions listed. Looking more carefully at the syntax of the sentence reveals that the actions can be done by the person making the bet rather than by the ace. (Incidentally, the usual way to win the bet is to flick the ace up from the bottom of the pack — where it usually is in most new, unshuffled decks — catch it, throw it across the room, and then take a pen to write the person's name on their forehead.)
</li><li> Politics as a whole can rest on this; for example, take this example of a <a class="urllink" href="http://twitter.com/#!/TomHarrisMP/status/12848387174965249">British MP<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claiming that his party had not broken an election promise, as the law would not take effect until after the next election (but was voted on comfortably three years into Parliament).

While the part about the views is true, most of the people who watched it clicked the dislike button. In fact, this is a truism for any kind of measure based solely on views, including Nielsen ratings and box-office receipts. Just because people <em>watch</em> something doesn't mean they <em>like</em> it.

When the recruiter asked how old they were, they could join without having lied, as they were "over 18." The same story is told in most of Europe in regards to soldiers signing up in WWI and WWII.

The prescribed remedy, instead, is more adroit and specific followup questions by the examining lawyer. In their defense, the Court was somewhat dubious of sustaining a perjury prosecution on the basis of a possible misunderstanding. To provide further context, Bronston's testimony was only technically incomplete, but on its face only answered a specific part of the question, and the lawyer in question failed to ask an obvious followup question.
<div class="indent">"Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?" "A. No, sir." "Q. Have you ever?" "A. The company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich."

Which of course, was true, but it wasn't her <em>next</em> birthday.

</li><li> Back before railroads had crossing gates, they had actual flagmen who would stand at an intersection and swing a lantern to warn approaching traffic of the train. In a lawsuit over damage and injuries due to a collision at night the flagman, who might have been intoxicated at the time, testified that he did swing his lamp to try and warn the approaching motorist. This may or may not have been true, but he failed to mention that his lamp was not lit.
</li><li> In the Middle Ages to early modern period, there was much debate over what, on a Catholic perspective, counted as lying. For instance, there was the story of a bishop of Alexandria fleeing persecution by the Romans, who didn't know his appearance. Coming upon him with his students, they asked where he had gone. The man told them back the way he had just come. Some defended this, since it was <em>technically</em> true.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">James Garfield</a> was shot in 1881, but the bullet was barely a flesh wound — he died of a raging infection, caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">Worst Aid</a> because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveToGetTheBulletOut">We Have to Get the Bullet Out</a>. Naturally, his assassin Charles Guiteau decided to <em>use this as a defense in court</em>, admitting to the shooting but arguing that it was the doctors who really committed the murder. He was convicted anyway, because it was his shooting that prompted the doctors to do anything at all.
</li><li> Frankie Laine, the man who sung the title song for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles">Blazing Saddles</a></em>, was told the film was a "Western about a black sheriff dealing with racism". What he didn't know was that the film was a <em>comedy</em> and he wound up giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookTheBadFilmSeriously">a heartfelt, sincere performance</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks">Mel Brooks</a> didn't have the heart to tell him after hearing the song and Laine didn't find out the truth until he actually saw the movie.

In addition, Brooks's casting call was for "a Frankie Laine-type singer", so he was very much surprised (and happy) when the real Frankie Laine auditioned.
</li><li> A common line often mentioned regarding a well-known employee/manager/cast member/etc in any business suddenly disappearing from work and not showing up from that day forward is to issue a statement along the lines that the "staff member has left the company to pursue other business interests/jobs" and leave it at that. Often times, this is because the staff member in question was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">offered the option to resign with dignity or be fired and escorted off the premises over some screw up on their part</a>. Alternatively, the staff member in question may have just issued the heads of management a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt">spontaneous notice of resignation</a>, who rather not reveal any potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">parting words</a> that was issued by the employee. Similarly, a common reason given for leaving a job, especially among politicians, is "to spend more time with my family." While this may certainly be a benefit of such a decision, it's rarely the sole (or even primary) reason; more likely it's a cover-up for something the person would prefer to keep hidden.

While this is <em>technically</em> true if you add up the numbers, viewership averages at 100,000 to only 10,000 views per episode, decreasing sharply over time. Each episode is only 3 minutes long not counting compilations, for a total of only 375 minutes, or 6 hours and 15 minutes.

</li></ul></li><li> "The theory of natural selection doesn't explain the origin of life." This is actually true, but it's also completely irrelevant. Natural selection applies only to living systems, not nonliving matter. Even people who should know better (such as Sir Anthony Kenny, in his history of Western Philosophy) have used this line as an equivocation.
</li><li> "The theory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Evolution">Evolution</a> [by natural selection] is "just" a theory".

A law and a theory can conceivably have the same degree of proof, but a law will deal with a broad, general scientific observation while a theory will deal with a narrower scientific explanation. Contrast, for example, the Law of Universal Gravitation, that observes that all things with mass exert and are subject to gravity, and the Theory of General Relativity, which tries to explain why.</span> This is also an example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTermsFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTermsFallacy">Four Terms Fallacy</a>.
