</p><p>This character has been hurt by the world. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">A lot.</a></em> Yet despite their pain they never lose hope in their most cherished dream, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">draw strength</a> from pursuing their most fervent desire. Sadly, it's a fool's dream, and not in the romantic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em> sense. It's something that is not just out of reach, but that they are fundamentally incapable of achieving or receiving, and they are usually too emotionally damaged to realize this. They either can't conceive of it as such or avoid the realization because they subconsciously know it would give them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">drive them to despair</a>. Because of this, the dream stops being something to pine for and becomes a tangible goal they seek, with uniformly horrifying results.
</p><p>There are a lot of reasons for the dream being out of reach, and for failing to achieve it. Here are a few common possibilities:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> They want something that is achievable by a normal person, but they're too emotionally unstable to make a well-thought out go at it, and usually botch the attempt. For example, an ex-boyfriend who was dumped for being unstable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHungry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHungry">might kidnap his girlfriend to try and get back together</a>, or a villain who suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicVillainy">Chronic Villainy</a> being unable to get the townspeople to love him.
</li><li> They have a truly impossible dream, and we mean "bend the laws of nature" or "requires someone to act <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>" to happen. There <em>may</em> be a way to actually do it, but the results aren't likely to be pretty, though they'll ignore any such warnings. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic">bringing a loved one</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> resulting in them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Coming Back Wrong</a>, or trying to hook up with someone who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>.
</li><li> They are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">plagued with mediocrity</a>. The dream isn't impossible for the more talented, nor is it physically impossible like the example above, but the person in question simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">isn't awesome enough</a>. Will likely lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalieriSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalieriSyndrome">Salieri Syndrome</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The dream <em>is</em> achievable...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">but you won't like the results of accomplishing or trying to accomplish it</a>. It can be a character after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>'s approval, but that approval is only given after the character does something tremendously damaging to themselves as a person or to another. Or realizing that It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">Lonely at the Top</a> and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheMoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheMoralityPet">Kicked The Wrong Dog</a> in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">ambitious</a> quest for love, fame, and/or fortune.
</li></ul><p>That said, some characters who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">experience an epiphany</a> and realize the dream is impossible may live long and happy lives, provided they make the painful decision to abandon their dream and don't decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">ignore the epiphany.</a>
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>, where the dream is achieved with little or no effort from the character, but then forces them to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">bad</a> consequences of realizing it.
</p><p>This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope">Sister Trope</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap">Dream-Crushing Handicap</a>, where the reason the dream is impossible is a physical defect. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeafComposer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeafComposer">Deaf Composer</a> may or may not be this, depending on if they're badass enough to compensate for their disability. As the name would suggest, very often puts the Tragic in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a>. If the dream is only impossible because it would mean the end of the story, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>. If the character gets so desperate that they become willing to do <em>anything</em> to achieve this dream, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>. Lastly, not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a>, though in some cases the events within it may be related to the unfulfilled goals the character used to have when he or she was alive.

<ul><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> are preteens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">gender identity issues</a>. Nitori is a trans girl while Takatsuki is a trans boy. Both dress as they want while alone together, but as bodies mature through adolescence their dysphoria only gets worse. The trope is eventually averted in the finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with implications that Nitori will transition during or after college.</span>
</li><li> This seems to be a major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>, as a few characters are described as having dreams that they can never achieve. One dream in particular <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was the entire reason the story took place. Yuuko apparently died at some point and it became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s obsession to revive her. <em>Everything</em> that happened was either part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> to revive her(something clearly stated to be impossible) or the multiple gambits designed to stop him</span>.
</li><li> Jellal's dream for freedom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, even if that may sound wrong. He was a child slave. His best friend/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">possible crush</a> staged a rebellion, developed magic, and overthrew their oppressors just to save him from torture. Rather than get to relish in his freedom with her, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">forcibly turned into a villain</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl who would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">later pretend to be his underling</a></span>. So now he's spent X many years of his childhood as a slave and spent eight brainwashed. His former childhood friend who once went to great lengths for him wants him dead. Her new friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">seemingly</a> helps her get her wish. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Jellal manages to come back he has amnesia and has genuinely regained his former nice personality, but gets to enjoy this for less than 24 hours before being arrested for the crimes he was deceived into committing</span>. By the end, he's a fugitive on the run whose former minions want him dead and buried.
<ul><li> Said underling was trying to go back in time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and redo her life from the moment that it went horribly wrong</span>. Bonus points for not realizing at that exact moment that her mother <em>didn't</em> forget her, she just got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> to mask the pain, and all of this could have been avoided if she <em>walked five steps forward</em> instead of deciding to invent time travel. Eventually, the weight of all her merciless war crimes (when thinking that she could just undo them by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not becoming a dark time mage</span>) crushed her psyche, and she ends up using a high-risk version of time travel to pay her debts to society. At best, it hyper-ages her into an old lady, at worst, she really is dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Manga-version Greed may have such a dream. Despite essentially being a parasitic entity formed of concentrated greed and thousands of tormented souls, his true dream is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">to have friends</a></span>. It seems he subconsciously recognized the impossibility of this dream and so instead focused all his efforts on acquiring everything else to fill the great gaping emptiness he felt inside. One character commented that it was sad how he could not even remember his own dream.
</li><li> Surprisingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Father, the main antagonist of the story, was driven to the horrible acts he committed likely as a result of his own dream: to be free of his flask. Ultimately, the only method he could devise to accomplish that task was to carry out the destruction of Xerxes, and from that point on he would do anything to maintain and expand his freedom</span>.
</li><li> Greed's dream is even more tragic because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he actually achieves it moments before dying for good. He seems a little surprised when he realizes that he cares enough for Ling to sacrifice himself to keep Father from absorbing him too. He is even more surprised when he sees Ling and Ed trying so hard to save him. He spends his dying moments saying goodbye to his friends.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Meiling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardCaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> has one dream: to marry Syaoron and live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>, even going so far as to make him swear they'll be together so long as he never finds anyone he likes better. Of course, he eventually falls in love with Sakura and Meiling is gracious enough to back off without a fuss, but it's still heartbreaking to see her sob in Tomoyo's arms because her dream's been shattered for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Future Trunks' appearance and desires are all based on his mother Bulma's wishes to live in a peaceful world without the androids terrorizing it, and eventually realizes that whatever changes he makes in the current timeline won't affect his timeline.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Trunks</strong>: My mother wanted the world to have a good future, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">even if she couldn't live in it.</a>
</div><ul><li> This was also true of Vegeta, whose one goal in life was to become a Super Saiyan so that he would have the power to surpass Goku, and destroy Frieza to avenge the loss of his people and his planet. This is actually subverted when he actually achieves his dream of becoming a Super Saiyan in the Android Saga, but still never surpasses Goku before he dies fighting Cell and then finally averted at the end of the Buu Saga when he admits Goku's better than him and makes peace with being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">second best</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Future Trunks visits present day Gohan and gets to see the happy family Gohan made for himself. He briefly imagines what his life would be like if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black</span> never invaded his world.

In truth, Shiro has a proxy in the Rider War whom he intends to win so that he may have the wish for himself. His wish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is to save his sister Yui, who is destined to die on her 20th birthday</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: The Eleventh Doctor had a dream to finally get home to Gallifrey <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after saving it from destruction.</span> In his last adventure, he is literally feet away from finally getting there, but he cannot get to them or the war they were locked out from in the first place will just restart. He tries for centuries to make the area safe enough to release them, but he regenerates and loses his opportunity despite finally making the area safe to bring them back. And while future incarnations do eventually return, the man who started it all will never get home.
<ul><li> His next incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor, has his own tragic dream two seasons later: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> save Clara Oswald from her death, a fixed point in time which he witnessed, and give her a nice, ordinary life in which she has no memory of him</span>. He suffers mightily to achieve the means of making this possible, namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> escaping his own people's unjust prison for him, <em>returning to Gallifrey at last</em></span>, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> using their technology to pull her out of time at the fatal moment</span>. The problem is that achieving his dream could end up <em>destroying the universe</em> — but having long since gone insane, he no longer cares about the risk. Eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clara herself, who doesn't want such a fate,</span> convinces him that he has gone too far. He repents and accepts the fate of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> losing both her and many of his memories of her</span> to both atone for his selfishness and return to his best, sane self. The sad irony is that the Doctor actually <em>could</em> have had his tragic dream realized, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to the fact that Clara <em>does</em> continue to live on, albeit in a "not-quite-dead" state, as a functional immortal. He and Clara could have spent the rest of eternity together, so long as Clara, at some point, returns to the moment of her death. But the danger of the two staying together is just too great.</span>
</li><li> An ongoing theme of the series is the Doctor as a "lonely angel." Due to his near-immortality and dangerous lifestyle, he is never able to actually have a "happy ending", whether that be settling down with any of the companions he'd fallen in love with or married over the millennia, or simply living a quiet retirement (he tries, but it never takes). There are hints of him eventually settling down as a "curator" in the 50th anniversary, but given when it happened, the doctor's retirement is still a LONG way off.

Death orders Dean to kill Sam in order to prevent Sam from going to extreme lengths once again, only for Dean to kill Death with the latter's own scythe.

<div class="indent">The possibility of victory must be there in tragedy. Where pathos rules, where pathos is finally derived, a character has fought a battle he could not possibly have won.
