Authors (and people in general) who subscribe to the Golden Mean Fallacy have another outlook. They believe that there are in fact three sides: the side of the complete morons to the left of them, the side of the complete morons to the right of them, and their own side, which combines the good points of each in sublime harmony while avoiding all the bad. If one position is argued to be superior <em>solely</em> because it is in the middle, then this is the Golden Mean Fallacy, aka "Argument to Moderation." It's also sometimes called the Gray Fallacy, between black and white options.
</p><p>The fallacy is not merely saying that compromise between opposing viewpoints is good. It is saying that extreme solutions are <em>never</em> reasonable or correct, and the correct solution can <em>always</em> be found in the middle. For example: some say cyanide is a lethal and dangerous poison and should never be consumed. The opposite position would be that cyanide is nutritious and beneficial to your health and should be consumed frequently. The golden mean fallacy would state that cyanide should therefore be consumed in moderation.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The Golden Mean Fallacy is turning both sides of an argument into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Strawman Politicals</a> and declaring that the only sensible "realist" approach is to take the middle road. There is a number of benefits to this. You avoid offending either side too much, since they can each take comfort in the fact that their enemies get just as much ridicule; you get to come off as a sensible person who thinks for oneself and doesn't blindly follow any one party line; and you get twice as many people to insult and make fun of. The downside is when one side is <em>so</em> objectively unreasonable (see the above cyanide example) that ceding any ground to it makes you look crazy.
</p><p>Another handy (and sneaky) thing with this method is that you don't actually have to be very moderate to use it. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Political</a> is by definition more extreme and unreasonable than any position in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note016p0');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note016p0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note016p0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">Poe's Law</a> notwithstanding</span> so there is nothing stopping you from presenting a horrific parody of one side of the issue, then presenting a horrific parody of the other side of the issue, and finally presenting your own actual opinions as a moderate option. It will look very sane and reasonable in comparison, even if in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> it would be considered quite extremist. Another way of looking at it is by invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorseshoeEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorseshoeEffect">The Horseshoe Effect</a>: if the people on each extreme have more in common with each other than they do with the people in the centre, than the centre starts to look a lot more favourable.

</p><p>A few notes about this trope: it does not mean giving equal weight to two opposing viewpoints, when in reality one is far more credible than the other. That is called "False Equivalency". It is also not saying that moderate compromises are always wrong. Sometimes an option somewhere in between two polar opposites really <em>is</em> the best choice; this trope is when the author claims the best choice <em>must</em> be found in the middle. In other words, it is the opposite of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy">False Dichotomy</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> turned up to 11. In conclusion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">use neither the False Dichotomy nor the Golden Mean Fallacy,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">but reason somewhere in the middle.</a>

Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>. Named for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s concept of virtue, which presented the golden mean as the excellent ideal of behavior. Obviously, he didn't consider it a fallacy. Aristotle's golden mean also often <em>did</em> lean slightly towards excess or deficiency, rather than being precisely in the middle, and varied from situation to situation; he himself made it clear that he was not espousing a purely mathematical mean between two extremes, but rather a moral best course of action that the "extremes" were defined in contradistinction to. However, he also said that some actions were so bad that they could <em>never</em> be justified, let alone be made to appear moderate.
</p><p>Please also note that the conflict need not have a right or wrong side in order to be this. For example, a conflict between two foods for dinner could result in a truly disgusting "compromise" dish. So long as the viewpoints are incapable of compromise, in that any compromise is at least as bad as either side, anybody who tries to claim compromise is always right will be guilty of this fallacy.
</p><p>Compare <em>and</em> contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntolerableTolerance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntolerableTolerance">Intolerable Tolerance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">Culture Justifies Anything</a>, which commit the same fallacy from the opposite direction: saying that everyone is <em>right</em> instead of that everyone is wrong.

Having been brainwashed as a child by his father into believing that the radical Roman Catholic sect they belonged to demanded that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">evildoers be slaughtered by "avenging angels"</a>, Valley experiences a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when, as Batman, he finds a serial killer at his mercy (hanging by one hand over a vat full of molten steel in a foundry) and is tormented by visions of both his late father and the medieval French saint, Dumas, who founded their breakaway movement. The elder Valley demands that his son shoot his blades at the killer so that he will fall into the vat, while St. Dumas insists that he must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">save anyone in danger</a>, no matter how reprehensible they are.

The merits of moderation were a matter of some heated debate in one episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Josh:</strong> If we had a bench full of moderates in '54, Separate But Equal would still be on the books, and this place would still have two sets of drinking fountains. <br/><strong>Toby:</strong> Moderate means temperate, it means responsible.

This allows for both positions to be represented while not having to settle for "moderation" It's worth noting that the "moderate" in this case is only considered so because of the American tradition of politicizing the Supreme Court.

Amaar, the imam, erected a wall that stretched halfway across the room, so the conservative-minded men could pray in front of it with the conservative-minded women behind it, while the liberal congregants would pray on the wall-less side of the room.

His example is the debate on climate change science, a subject on which 97% of the world's scientists agree, and he proposes a new format for debate: instead of having one climate change denier debate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy">Bill Nye the Science Guy</a> as this trope describes, three climate change deniers would debate ninety-six climate change-believing scientists... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy">Bill Nye the Science Guy</a>.

Tiffany's assessment of herself was that, while she was gorgeous and obviously a sexual tease, she struck a balance between the other smart girls who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd">overly intellectual and cared nothing for their personal appearance</a> (she said <em>to their faces</em> that they were "dried-up old prunes") and outright slutty bimbos (most notably her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">arch-nemesis</a>, Sable) for using their good looks only to gain sexual pleasure rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey">trying to gain a sociopolitical advantage over men</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> utilized this trope a lot in an attempt to keep all six characters favorable in the eyes of the audience even when issues rose up that split the group. The most notable instance was the infamous "we were on a break" argument, where Ross slept with another woman after Rachel wanted a vague "break" from their relationship. The following episode dealt with the fallout where neither party took the blame and looked to their friends to declare who was more in the right. Eventually, the other four tell Ross and Rachel that who's right or wrong isn't important to them, but that if they couldn't get over it and be civil to each other, then the whole group could not be together from that point. While Ross and Rachel both believe themselves to be in the right for the series, they take the words to heart and bury the issue for the sake of the group.

Two women each claim to be a boy's mother. Solomon cannot tell who is lying, so he declares that he will cut the baby in half and give each woman her "share". The boy's true mother gives up her claim so that the child lives, which reveals who truly loved him. Subverted in that Solomon never intended this as a legitimate solution but only a trap to catch out the liar, leading to the phrase "splitting the baby" when someone destroys the subject of a dispute rather than assign it to one party.

The sage decides that the only way to solve the argument is to eat part of the large rice cake so they are the same size, but he intentionally takes a too-large bite so that he subsequently has to take a bite of the other rice cake to equalize them again. He does this until both are gone, ultimately saying "there, now you're both equally dissatisfied."

</li><li> C.S. Lewis' famous trilemma was a response to this, namely the position that one could believe in the Bible but deny the divinity of Jesus, to avoid the "extremes" of orthodox Christianity and atheism. Lewis points out that this doesn't make sense, because in the Bible, Jesus claims and acts consistent with divinity, meaning that if you want to accept the Bible and deny Jesus' divinity, you have to either claim that Jesus was delusional or that he was lying. Some have criticized this trilemma on the basis that Jesus could simply have been genuinely mistaken about his divinity or that the Gospels were simply fictional, but Lewis' response was that taking this position still requires one to both deny the veracity of the Bible and deny the divinity of Christ, meaning that it's still an all-or-nothing proposition.

To make matters worse this is similar to Saren's argument in the first game, and Shepard thought it was both stupid and a sign he'd lost his mind (though Saren's position differed in that he wanted organic life to be useful enough to the Reapers that they would allow it to continue because of that, rather than true synthesis).</span>
</li><li> A point of contention certain fans have with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> is the idea of balance between light and darkness.

With sole exception to Riku and Terra, both of who catch all sorts of hell for using the dark powers in the process, the preaching of light and darkness finding a balance is pretentious at most.

<ul><li> The episode on gay marriage, for example, parodied this trope by having a politician offer a "compromise" solution in which gay people could get all the legal benefits of marriage, but instead of using traditionally straights-only terms like "marriage," "married," and "husband and wife," they would be called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">"butt buddies"</a>. Much like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, no one was particularly pleased.
</li><li> An attempt at having a golden means solution, which shows just how fallacious this trope really is, appears in the episode "I'm a Little Bit Country." Half of the town opposes the war in Iraq, while the other half supports it. After going back in time and meeting the founding fathers, Cartman believes he has the right answer. He says that America needs the pro-war people to support America's wars so America looks like a strong country, but we also need the anti-war people to oppose these wars so America looks like a compassionate country. Both sides are happy with this answer, because it basically means the war will continue, and the anti-war crowd gets to continue protesting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> made fun of this at the end of one episode, where Bender states the moral he learned:
<div class="indent">"I'll never be too good or too evil ever again, I'll just be me." <br/>"Do you think you could be a <em>little</em> less evil?" <br/>"I don't know, Leela. Do you think you could survive a 600-foot fall?"
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> has one episode where Stan and Francine argue over how to raise Steve, with Stan preferring strict discipline and Francine preferring a hands-off approach. To determine who's right, Stan has Steve cloned and each of them will raise one how they see fit. This results in Stevearino (the clone) becoming a crazy cat killer due to Stan's overbearing rules while Francine's coddling devolves the original Steve into a spoiled brat who does nothing but sit on the couch and eat junk food. At the end of the episode, they realize that Steve needs both of them to parent him so he balances out.

</li><li> In Livy's writings, the Samnites manage to trap a Roman army in a narrow pass, but since the relations between the two people was tense, but not yet at war, their commander vacillated about what to do. One of his advisers said he should let them go, and try to win friends with the Roman people. Another one said that they should wipe out this army and try their best to crush Rome while it was reeling from the blow. He eventually settles on humiliating the Roman army, accepting surrender and token tribute from them, and then letting them go home. The result? The Romans get pissed, but are still at more or less full strength, and come back with a vengeance, stomping him hard.

</li><li> One of the theories about the Treaty of Versailles that ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> was that it was compromised by this principle. The French delegation wanted to cripple Germany so that they could return to her 'glory days' of being the primary power of continental Europe; the Italians wanted as much Austro-Hungarian territory as they could get; the British wanted to avoid upsetting Germany or France or Italy so they could resume doing business with them all; and the U.S. delegation wanted to redraw the map of Europe on the model of North America because they believed that the ethnic heterogeneity of the region had caused the war and that peace and international cooperation would be easier if Europe was ruled by ethnically homogenous nation-states. The treaty ended up:
<ul><li> So harsh that the Franco-British leadership and public would later feel guilty about enforcing it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note495gx');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note495gx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note495gx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was part of the wider cultural reconsideration of the war, with many people beginning to consider World War One as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife">a waste of money and lives</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">by the late 1930s</a>.</span>
</li><li> Too weak to actually cripple Germany (permanently that is, it did stunt them for a short while and eventually lead to Hitler's rise). The burden of paying Reparations was smaller than that of maintaining the pre-war German military. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5m8gr');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5m8gr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5m8gr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was deliberate.</span>
</li><li> Too miserly with Italy. The Italian leadership and public felt cheated by and resentful of their wartime allies. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6vwbd');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6vwbd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6vwbd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was largely their own fault, as at the very last minute the Italian delegation walked out in protest because they weren't going to get all the territories that they wanted. When they walked back in, to their horror they discovered that the Americans had rewritten the treaty and everyone had signed it: Italy wasn't going to get <em>any</em> territories which didn't have large Italian minorities in them! The Americans had been their primary opponent in these negotiations because their commitment to the nation-state principle meant they had been very reluctant to give territories which had few or no Italians in them to Italy. In the end Italy got almost none of Austria-Hungary's Adriatic coastline, even though she had been promised (and wanted) all of it and was going to get reasonably large chunks of it before the Italian delegation walked out.</span>
</li><li> Too committed to the principle of nation-states. Europe was now dotted with half a dozen small and poor states which would have to support disproportionately large militaries to defend themselves from Germany and Russia (and each other) and would quickly fold in the event of an economic depression.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Insufficiently committed to the principle of nation-states</a>. Refusal to institute population transfers to ensure ethnic homogeneity in the new states meant that most of them had large ethnic minorities, giving those states incentives to institute ethnic cleansing or wage war to 'liberate' their people from other states.
</li></ul></li><li> This can be exploited for marketing purposes with what is known as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_pricing#Goldilocks_pricing">Goldilocks pricing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Suppose you have two products, Product A is the basic version which gives just the essentials for a low price, and Product B has all the bells and whistles but is more expensive. Many people will see this and decide that A does all they need, and so there is no point in paying extra for B. On the other hand, bring out Product C which is slightly better than Product B but with another price hike, and suddenly B becomes much more tempting, as it offers most of what you get from C but at a lower price. The classic example of this is Economy, Business, and First Class seating on airlines.
</li><li> Defied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, even though he is often looked to as the source of the fallacy. Though he does argue that each virtue is a mean between excess and deficit, he remarks that it would be stupid to infer that therefore we should seek moderation in all things. What is an appropriate level of a particular character is context-dependent, and certain character traits are so unambiguously evil that there is not such thing as a moderate amount.
</li><li> The idea that teachers should deal with school bullies by staying neutral is an example. Many schools treat bullying as though it were a mutual conflict where both students are equally wrong, rather than one student abusing another. Of course, without evidence, even if it seems clear one kid most likely started it, teachers are usually expected not to be biased towards either party, especially once parents get involved. The general principle is usually expressed, as probably everyone has heard, "It takes two people to start a fight/argument". Approximately 90% of the time someone says this, it's because they don't want to go to the trouble of finding out if one of those two people was right. Or it's because they can't figure out that it actually only takes 1 person to start a fight, it just takes 2 people to make it a fair fight rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">a merciless beat-down</a>. It leads to kids not reporting that they're being bullied, because they figure they'll only get punished as well.
</li><li> The Compromise of 1850 in the United States was designed to avert an impending crisis over slavery by giving both sides some of what they wanted. The result was the compromise simply kicked the can down the road ten years, and fell prey to OkrentÂ’s Law besides.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7cvca');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7cvca" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7cvca');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The law states "the pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true." In other words, either the abolitionists were correct that there was a moral imperative to abolish slavery across the nation, or the expansionists were right that it was a political question that each territory should decide for itself, and attempting to indulge both points of view was an inherently incorrect approach.</span> The following decade caused the battle lines on both sides of the issue to harden considerably, and practically guaranteed that the issue would be solved with guns, not words.
</li><li> This is apparently how Stalin won debates before he became undisputed ruler of the Soviet Union. He would ask for the two opposing sides of an issue, then say he belonged to a sensible middle, undermining both rivals.
</li><li> Historian Gaddis Smith observed that during the Cold War, when strategists were called upon to provide the president with a list of options for a crisis situation, they'd usually provide five options. Option #1 would be "capitulate", option #5 would be "nuclear war". The strategist's actual proposal would be option #3. This tactic is typically used by the US military to this day when advising the President of options in a conflict, apparently hoping to invoke this as a cognitive bias in favor of their proposed position. This has at least once backfired, with US President Donald Trump having chosen one of the most extreme options.
</li><li> During the Constitutional Convention, two of the compromises were essentially this:
<ul><li> First was the Great Compromise, which took the Virginia Plan (allocate votes based on population) and the New Jersey Plan (each state gets the same number of votes) and put them together. No one really thought that was a good idea, but since the issue had become a deadlock, they accepted it and today it is seen by some as a perfectly reasonable way of doing things. Or depending on your point of view, it's an even worse idea than it was back then now that some states have grown to have over ten times the population of others leading to a situation where a representative elected by one-hundred thousand voters has the same amount of policy making power as a representative elected by a million voters.
</li><li> The second compromise, the Three-Fifths Compromise (slaves count as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of legislative apportionment), was a more literal application of this trope, between the position that slaves shouldn't be counted at all (as they were not considered legal persons according to the Constitution) and that they should be counted just like everyone else (as even without civil rights, they were still technically persons) and is often considered the founders' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">greatest failure</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends">It has since been redacted by the Fourteenth Amendment</a>. Many people today don't seem to realize that not counting the slaves at all was the <em>anti-slavery</em> position, and that it was the <em>pro-slavery</em> faction that advocated counting them as full people - for purposes of allocating congressional delegates, presidential votes, taxes, etc., certainly not for giving them any rights or the vote. The compromise was an attempt to reduce the political power of slave holding states from what it would have been if slaves had been counted as full persons, with the hope that eventually the free states would have enough congress members to make slavery illegal through legislation. It didn't work out that way, mainly because no one's commitment to nationwide abolition was as strong as anticipated.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s "evil empire" speech argued that anyone who saw the United States and Soviet Union as moral equals was using this fallacy: "I urge you to beware the temptation of pride, the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil." Notably, when re-election time came along, his tone became much more conciliatory, suggesting that swing voters at least, weren't quite so certain of the dichotomy. Reagan's opponents, of course, charged that the controversy was never about whether the Soviet Union was good or bad (it was clearly bad, assuming you were a mainstream American), but whether America's moral superiority <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">gave it license to do whatever it wished to thwart the Soviets and still remain morally superior</a>. Around the same time, Reagan's ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick, made much the same argument in an essay called "The Myth of Moral Equivalence".
</li><li> Lots of countries, such as England, America, Japan, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc. have a proverb that is some variation of, "If two people quarrel, both are wrong." Many readers of this page might recognize the more familiar, "It takes two to tango." Sometimes this proverb makes sense (a lot of times, to be fair), but other times, one person has clearly done something unethical or irrational (a police officer who arrests the wrong man for a murder, for example, or a child who throws a softball through someone else's window and breaks it); if you claim both parties are wrong in <em>those</em> cases, then even if you're arguing for something in the middle you are actually punishing the one person who <em>didn't</em> tango, by making it wrong for him/her to protest in addition to the pain already inflicted on him/her. Of course, be careful when arguing that particular point, since <em>usually</em> the proverb about quarreling is correct.
</li><li> Because of two vocal factions reacting to the Boy Scouts Of America's ban on gay members, the group proposed to allow gay youth but not gay leaders (since the organization does not condone having leaders discuss homosexual behavior with Scouts). One side wants no gay members; the other points out that gay children grow up. The Scouts' steady decline in membership has partially been attributed to the fact that neither side is satisfied with the compromise and both have refused to participate in protest.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_boundary_dispute">Alaska Boundary Dispute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: Because of ambiguous phrasing in the <em>Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825</em>, a three-way dispute arose between the U.S., Canada and British Columbia on the borders of the Alaska Panhandle. At one point this nearly came to violence over the death of a pig, only averted because the commanders in the field agreed that would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyReasonForWar">profoundly stupid.</a> The tribunal that ultimately decided the question basically split the U.S. and Canadian positions, leading to a result that was <em>definitely</em> inconsistent with the wording of the Convention.
</li><li> The trend towards centrism and the major focus on making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">Conscription</a> equal (Â‘load equalityÂ’) for all Israelis (as some Ultra Orthodox Jews are exempt from service so they can focus on their religious studies) in the Israeli political climate around the 2013 elections, which led to the adamantly centrist Israeli Future Party (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">yes, thatÂ’s its name</a>) winning almost one sixth of the seats in the Knesset (the Israeli house of representatives). This trend was thoroughly mocked in a skit on the Israeli satire show, featuring the representative of the Â‘extremist sectÂ’ of the Israeli centre, who insisted on Â‘load equalityÂ’ in <em>everything</em>â€”for instance, when he sees a man stealing his bicycle on the street, he protests and gives him a tool to break locks and steal everyone elseÂ’s, too, in the name of Â‘load equality in crimeÂ’.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies">Fascism claimed</a> that it was a post-ideological movement based purely upon practical policy prescriptions, taking effective communist and capitalist programs and using them to advance the national interest. In doing so it <em>de facto</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">created a new ideology</a>. Some ideologically liberal academics, especially in the USA, teach their students that Fascism was a compromise between group and individual identity since it neither erased national boundaries nor respected individual rights like the latter. That is a valid perspective, but believing that it was important at the time is a misconception arising from a backward reading of the age's issues (as well as Americanocentric). Certainly, rich people of the time did promote individualism to try to protect their wealth being taxed/expropriated by collectives (whether by communities, unions, or nations) - but belief in individualism was neither prevalent nor something the Fascist program was particularly dedicated to eradicating.
</li><li> This trope went in three directions simultaneously during the American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. At one extreme were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">the "good" segregationists</a> who condemned lynching and the Ku Klux Klan but also condemned race-mixing; next to them was the conservative, legalist wing of the integration movement (embodied by the NAACP and many white moderates/liberals) that condemned both segregation and the civil-disobedience tactics employed by activists to the left of them; and next to <em>them</em> was the movement's progressive wing (embodied by Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>), which deemed the NAACP wing too passive but also considered civil disobedience to be a good, peaceful alternative to the tactics of the movement's more militant wing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a>, etc.). It is a credit to the rhetorical skill and political acumen of Dr. King's faction that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">now considered the golden mean on civil rights by most Americans</a>, even those who are uncomfortable with citizen activism and identity politics (though those who hold such views often erase King's anti-capitalism and opposition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>), while the "good" segregationists are generally seem as functionally indistinguishable from the KKK. This example is also a good illustration of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> of a group thinking its positions are moderate even as other groups think they are too far to the right or the left.
</li><li> Funnily enough this applied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WorldWarII/TheAftermath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WorldWarII/TheAftermath">the trials of German War Criminals</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and particularly the trials of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">German military (Wehrmacht) personnel</a>. Italy, Poland, and the Soviet Union wanted every senior military officer who'd killed civilians or POW during the war to be hung or spend the rest of their life in jail (since said personnel had directly killed several million of their citizens, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">enabled the killing of millions mor</a>e). Britain and the USA wanted junior military officers who'd killed British or American POW hung or jailed, and the rest to go free (since said personnel had killed several dozen of their citizens, and letting the rest go free would avoid alienating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeAreNotTheWehrmacht">the West German military establishment and so faciliate a swift reconciliation</a>). Neither side walked away happy. The Anglo-Americans were pissed at being forced to compromise their principles and try more than a dozen senior military officers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">who had committed no crimes against Anglo-American military personnel.</a> The Italians, Poles, and Soviets were pissed that these men were all released after less than six years in jail and many more senior Wehrmacht officers were never tried on the grounds of ill-health.
</li><li> Britain under the Labour Party of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClementAttlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClementAttlee">Clement Attlee</a> did this in the period 1945-50 when attempting to ensure the future prosperity and well-being of Britain and her people. They instituted a Socialist Welfare State but retained a Capitalist Free Market Economy. The Welfare State was hamstrung by the lack of funding for education (just bodies to 'promote the importance of education') and the Free Market policies didn't work out because the UK economy needed government control and investment to make a smooth transition to modern industrial production (all they had was advisory bodies to 'encourage more competitive practices'). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8z3qt');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8z3qt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8z3qt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In the 1960s the Labour government of Harold Wilson again shied away from major government intervention, instead protecting the UK's moribund industries from foreign competition. This ultimately set the stage for the sudden shocks of Thatcher's prime ministership in the '70s, which would have totally tanked the UK's economy if not for the sudden glut of North Sea Oil revenues. France is generally held up as the example of what Britain 'should have done' (Welfare State including comprehensive education, capitalist economy with strong state controls), as her investments in education and industry meant she had a relatively competitive industrial sector in the '70s and the bulk of the workers who were fired had the skills to work in the emerging services sector </span>
</li><li> In the 1960s a international standard time was needed (to be used in space, for example) and English speakers wanted to call it "Coordinated Universal Time" while French speakers wanted to call it "Temps Universel CoordonnÃ©" and both refused to let the other language be shown as more important. The time standard is now known as UTC because that initialism doesn't work in either language.
</li><li> The handling of rape cases at American universities often falls into this trope. Sadly, there is often not enough evidence for a conviction, especially if the only evidence is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">conflicting stories from the alleged victim and alleged perpetrator</a>. In many cases, the Universities have taken the compromise of banning the alleged perpetrator from the University until the alleged victim has finished their studies. If the accused is innocent, this is a miscarriage of justice. If they are guilty, this is a horribly inadequate punishment that makes a mockery of the victim.
</li><li> St. John Henry Newman accused <em>himself</em> of this. He had been a priest of the Church of England, and argued that the Anglican Church was a true church because it was the middle path between the doctrinal excesses of Protestantism and the ritual excesses of Catholicism. He changed his mind when he started doing research for his book <em>On The Development of Christian Doctrine</em>, and learned that several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeresiesAndHeretics">heresies in Christian doctrine</a> were the result of trying to chart a compromise between a different heresy and the orthodox teaching, only to make an entirely different error that didn't actually resolve the conflict.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9yrm7');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9yrm7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9yrm7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The heresy of monothelitism (that Christ had two natures, but only one will), for example, was an attempt at a compromise between the orthodoxy (that Christ was a unity both a human and divine nature) and the heresy of monophystism (that Christ only had a a divine nature); Semi-Arianism (that the Father and the Son had a "similar" substance) was an attempt at compromise between Arianism (that the Father and Son were of a different substance) and the orthodox position (that the Father and the Son had the same substance).</span> This convinced Newman that he had been wrong, and to convert to Catholicism.
</li><li> People who speculate about the 1996 murder of JonBÃ©net Ramsey are divided in two camps, mostly: People who think the family did it, and stalled the investigation on purpose; and people who think an intruder broke in, and the police's investigation was faulty. Then there are some other people who try to "compromise", by proposing that an intruder did it, but the family stalled the investigation anyway because they were either in league with such intruder, or <em>mistakenly believed</em> one of their own had done it.
</li><li> Professional negotiators are taught to avoid this with the example of two people who want an orange: one to make juice, and the other to make a cake. The naive solution would be to cut the orange in half, giving both parties less of what they actually want. The correct solution is to give one the peel and the other the pulp of the whole orange, which is an actual compromise giving both exactly what they want.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> began thinking so later in his life, as said in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">Letter from a Birmingham Jail<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, saying that the worst enemies of the black cause weren't the ones openly opposing them, such as the openly racist politicians or Klan members, but the "white moderate" "who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice" since they would slow the activists' fight to a crawl, or even a complete stop, while still pretending to agree with them. In this case, he was reacting to an open letter from 6 clergyman, who attempted to suggest that King's "extreme" position of nonviolent civil disobedience was just as problematic as leaving Jim Crow be, and that the proper solution would simply be to rely on the law to quietly sort itself out over time. This, of course, ran into the exact same problem as the slavery example above, and it was ultimately King's firm commitment to his position that got the Jim Crow laws abolished over the next decade.
</li><li> In the 2019 Britain election, the Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn took a neutral stance on Brexit by supporting second referendum while not explicitly issuing a pro- or anti-Brexit position.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10i9d2');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10i9d2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10i9d2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While the Labour Party is very pro-European Union, Corbyn has a long history of Euroskepticism and was a reluctant player in the Remain campaign.</span> However, this approach backfired as pro-Brexit voters ended up voting for the Conservatives, who ran on an explicit Leave platform, while many anti-Brexit voters either stayed home or voted for other pro-EU parties like the Liberal Democrats. Many pundits cited Labour's indecisive stance on Brexit as a contributing factor towards their defeat in the election.
