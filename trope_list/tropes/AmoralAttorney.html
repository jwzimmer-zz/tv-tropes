Especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">the corporate ones</a>. Lawyers come in various degrees of oiliness, from slick, two-faced charmers to brutal bullies with a law degree. The worst defense attorneys will actually seem to know that their client is guilty and a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sociopath">sociopath</a>, and act as though they just love seeing the wicked go free, and will in fact happily count their money while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">the world burns</a>. Meanwhile, the worst prosecutors are perverted sadists who will ruthlessly hound and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingLecture">psychologically torture</a> defendants, and make them cry like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moeblob</a> in public court for all to laugh at, even when they personally acquire knowledge of their complete innocence, and have no problem advising their client (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">in very vague terms</a>) that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution">something untoward</a> happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses">to any key witnesses</a> it would be <em>so</em> much easier to win. If the main character is poor and/or not that intelligent, the Amoral Attorney is the Goliath in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath">David v. Goliath</a> scenario. Which of the two types of these attorneys appears usually correlates to the defendant's guilt: when an amoral prosecutor appears, than the defendant they're going after is almost always innocent, and amoral defense attorneys nearly always represent guilty-as-sin clients.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In reality, attorneys are simply acting and arguing on behalf of their clients, and are <em>supposed</em> to be amoral (not immoral!) in their advocacy. An attorney is a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero">Punch-Clock Hero</a> depending on who hires them. In fact, in some jurisdictions, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishCourts">the UK</a>, advocates <em>have no choice</em> who they defend: if approached, it's professional misconduct not to accept a case within their professional competence. Criminal defense attorneys, in particular, are often very kind-hearted, civic-minded people who genuinely believe that even the worst members of society have a good reason for committing their crime, or that no matter how heinous the crime or obvious the guilt, the State must still prove it beyond a reasonable doubt—even if they understand perfectly well that their client is almost certainly guilty. Ideally, a strong defense of their client serves as an important check against false accusations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">dirty cops</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">hanging judges</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">kangaroo courts</a>, and other forms of fast-but-unfair tyranny. Thus the defense attorney's arguments slow down the legal procedure for the sake of long-term accuracy. What an attorney should not be is <em>unethical</em>. In trope terms, a good lawyer is (ideally) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> in practice and (dare we say it) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> in intention. In the wonderful world of fiction, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism">Social Darwinism</a> is the name of the game. After all, it's not much of a "drama" if the opponent isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain">villainous and unlikable</a>, is it?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Another thing that people often forget is that for all the attention Criminal Law gets, they are actually a minority of the cases that appear before the courts. The vast majority of cases are civil cases, where in most instances everyone has something a bit off about them. This is particularly true in business-related cases, but except in family court (where very often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">someone is beating someone in their household up</a>, and even <em>then</em> there can be reciprocated abuse), <em>either</em> side could be seen as slimy or at least culpable in most suits.
</p><p>If desired, they can be made more sympathetic for audiences by having them do their jobs through gritted teeth for their loathsome clients as they quietly and firmly tell them to sit down and behave themselves. Furthermore, if they win, the lawyers in question can treat their clients coldly afterward by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">refusing to accept their thanks</a> and responding that they will send them their very expensive bill for services rendered, since they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>. A reasonably friendly social meeting between the prosecuting and defending lawyers after work can show that there are no hard feelings for each other doing their jobs as officers of the court.
</p><p>This trope is also usually averted if the lawyer in question is working for a cause such as environmentalism, legal aid, civil rights, or against corruption, which are often portrayed heroically (and usually, there <em>will</em> be an Amoral Attorney on the other side). Often if the main character is a lawyer, they will be forced to choose between a high paying but amoral position with a business law firm, or a low paying job for an environmental or civil rights organization. This trope can be seen as a consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPaysBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPaysBetter">Evil Pays Better</a>: defense attorneys could never get rich if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLawyersGoodClients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodLawyersGoodClients">only chose clients who were truly innocent</a>.
</p><p>It is worth pointing out that an Amoral Attorney is <em>competent</em>. They do not bring silly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">frivolous lawsuits</a>  that's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser">Ambulance Chaser</a>. Although often unethical, this villain isn't necessarily <em>corrupt</em>. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyers</a>, they don't necessarily <em>break</em> the law to win, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">they merely work around and within the law's limitations</a> with the assumption that their opposition will be doing the same thing in their own favor (or at least that the opposition would be stupid <em>not to</em> and thus would deserve a sound thrashing).

He ends up captured and turned over to the police by the JSA.

At one point, Alexei "Spaceman" Glushko makes a comment about his people not having evolved in millions of years - Frenzy takes offense and cites this as one of many common misconceptions about sharks. Spaceman wasn't talking about sharks. Fischmann is a senior partner at Metavac, Fischmann, and <em>Goebbels</em>, by the way. That's <em>Eddie</em> Goebbels, a <em>hypnotist</em>.

Hindel did such a poor job of representing Stark's interests that Tony finally fired him. Hindel would later return as the defense lawyer for Stark's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>, Kathy Dare, who was facing attempted murder charges for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">shooting Tony</a>. He used all sorts of sleazy legal tactics to make Stark look bad and portray Kathy as being under considerable mental stress.

Other zombies, such as Reginald Shoe, can be quite moral, but Slant appears to be motivated only by greed and is quite willing to break the law, or at least bend it into a pretzel. He is also quite quick to abandon his partners in crime when things threaten to go sour. Even his reason for still walking among the living like the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenantZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenantZombie">Revenant Zombies</a> is amoral; he refuses to stay in the grave because his family still hasn't paid him fees for the trial in which he defended himself and lost both the case and his head. Slant gets a rare heroic turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>, where he manages to silence a number of lawyers for the evil Lavish family with a single glare. This might be just to satisfy his own personal pride as the local alpha corpse of Ankh-Morpork's legal profession...
<ul><li> For all Slant is never really a good guy, he <em>is</em> very proud of the convoluted, inordinately labyrinthine structure that is Morporkian law. Since he wrote most of it up, it's pretty much <em>his</em> circus with monkeys. So, actually managing to defeat one of his (and/or his clients') schemes with said body of law earns his begrudging respect, no matter the personal loss — his darling baby is still being respected, after all. Having to watch anybody bumble their way through it causing an inordinate mess as they go, however, is the one thing that greatly annoys him: <em>especially</em> if, say, the soon-to-be ex-client didn't follow his advice or, worse, <em>refused to play within the loopholes</em>. The moment the clean-up becomes obviously more costly than his wage, he disengages.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham">John Grisham</a>:
<ul><li> Played very, very straight by Patton French, a tort lawyer who becomes a recurring character in Grisham's novels. French serves to embody everything Grisham hates about the American tort system, getting rich off of other peoples' medical misery while screwing his clients. He even appears in <em>The King of Torts</em>, giving aspiring tort lawyers advice on how to wring the most money out of their clients, which leaves the protagonist feeling like he needs to take a shower.
<ul><li> Said progatonist unfortunately gets caught up in the greed and files a lawsuit on a drug that he believes to cause benign cancer, and then settles for an amount that makes him incredibly and quickly rich, but also gets the plaintiffs he represents very little. This causes a problem when he is sued for legal malpractice after it turns out that the cancer is very, <em>very</em> malignant, and his former clients start dying and want to punish him for settling too fast for his own benefit. This reversal of fortune causes him to refuse a settlement offer in another case, where he puts his own financial needs above the needs of his clients, which gets him <em>assaulted</em> by those clients. And his reckless charge on other class action suits already caused his legal reinsurance company to drop him because they couldn't cover his exposure, so when the chips fall, he goes from one of the richest, most successful class action lawyers in the country to declaring bankruptcy and running away to try to live in secrecy for the rest of his life. In a period of about 18 months. It's hard to say that Grisham wasn't trying to write some karmic justice for amoral class action lawyers here.
</li></ul></li><li> Harry Rex Vonner, another recurring Grisham lawyer, isn't above bugging a jury room.
</li><li> An interesting case in <em>The Rainmaker</em>, where the lawyer in question may have been <em>pushed</em> into amorality: early in the discovery process, protagonist Rudy finds out his phone has been bugged, and suspects that it was done by the defense in his case. He quickly finds out that anything he says on the phone (such as the test case, where he tells his partner that his client wants to settle for a specific amount even though she has no intention of settling) is quickly relayed somehow to the defense team (in the test case, he gets a call within a few hours offering to settle for a little more than the amount he claimed in the call to his assistant). It's never clear if the defense team bugged the phone or the defendant did, but it's clear that the defense team is willing to use the information gained either way, which doesn't make the defense look good at all (and lets Rudy play them for complete fools during jury selection).

His description of law to the Houyhnhnms begins with this: "There was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black, and black is white, according as they are paid. To this society all the rest of the people are slaves." He just goes on from there.

Also, from the same novel, Albert Rodriguez, the Biogen lawyer, who is ready to violate the Burnets' rights by finding loopholes. Sure, an attorney who takes a case because he'll be able to generate a lot of fees is not necessarily amoral.

</li><li> In <em>No Way to Treat a First Lady</em>, Beth MacMann is represented by the famous trial lawyer Boyce "Shameless" Baylor, who didn't exactly get his nickname from defending sympathetic people and companies.
</li><li> Surprisingly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneOfUsIsLying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneOfUsIsLying">One Of Us Is Lying</a></em>.The lawyers are consummate professionals giving perfectly good advice, which the characters just find it impractical to follow. However, their job is to protect their own client, not the rest of the Four, nor to solve the murder. Eli, who works for a non-profit called Until Proven, is downright heroic.
</li><li> Napoleon Chotas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon">The Other Side of Midnight</a></em> and its sequel <em>Memories of Midnight</em> specializes in getting wealthy, powerful clients declared not guilty of their crimes — <em>especially</em> when there's a ton of evidence that would support a guilty verdict. In <em>Memories of Midnight</em>, he drinks the poison a woman used to kill her husband to prove to the jury that it wasn't actually poison at all; in truth, it <em>was</em> poison and he barely manages to get his stomach pumped afterward. In <em>The Other Side of Midnight</em>, he is immediately hired by Constantin Demeris to represent his mistress Noelle in her murder trial, and does a stunning job of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Constantin has Napoleon lie to Noelle and her lover (the other defendant) that if they plead guilty, they'll get a lighter sentence, when, in fact, they'll be put to death by a firing squad; this is Constantin's way to punish the lovers for crossing him. The sequel reveals Napoleon's regret; he too fell in love with Noelle. Constantin tries to have him killed to hide his crimes, but Napoleon survives to successfully defend him in his own murder trial — and immediately afterward, kills him and himself.</span>
</li><li> Annawake Fourkiller, the merciless Cherokee attorney from the novel <em>Pigs in Heaven</em>. She doesn't do much direct lawyering, but she's definitely amoral, with her constant bantering that all white people should be held accountable for the Trail of Tears, her near-stalker-like following of the main character, and attempts to take her daughter away. And, near the end of the novel, when her elderly uncle tells her off, she responds by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">beating him with a shoe</a>. She does mellow out eventually.
</li><li> Saad X. Saad of <em>Plain Heathen Mischief</em> has a machine in his office that, when a quarter is inserted, spits out a gumball of a random flavor. He tells Joel that it's a metaphor for the justice system—you might not get the gumball you want at first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">but you'll get it eventually if you keep putting money in</a>.

He manages to get the protagonists acquitted - though he knows that they're guilty of murder - just to win a bet with the prosecutor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></em>. The main character is a deeply honest criminal defense barrister who has successfully defended known criminals on more than one occasion (even murderers, though he doesn't usually discover this until after the verdict has been passed). His colleagues run the gamut from petty and mercenary to almost as upstanding as Rumpole (one is a member of a group called Lawyers As Christians), sometimes within the confines of the same story. Rumpole draws the line at representing someone who has said, in so many words, "I did it", often desperately trying to shut his clients up before they can spout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation">Too Much Information</a>. And he will have nothing to do with anything resembling subornation of perjury.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries">Sisterhood Series</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels">Fern Michaels</a>: Played with. On one side is Nikki Quinn, a defense attorney. On the other side is Jack Emery, a prosecuting attorney. Nikki defends a woman who shot the man who raped and murdered her daughter, and she shot the guy after the guy was found not guilty! Jack prosecutes the woman, which is ironic, because he prosecuted that murdering rapist and failed to convict the guy. Nikki is portrayed as the sympathetic one, and Jack is portrayed as the total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in that situation. You would find it hard to believe that Nikki and Jack are girlfriend and boyfriend! To Jack's credit, he did reveal in his thoughts that he is not heartless, and that he doesn't know what he would have done if he had a daughter who was raped and murdered. Funny enough, Nikki becomes a vigilante, Jack becomes an ally of the Vigilantes, and so does a defense attorney named Lizzie Fox. In the book <em>The Jury</em>, a defense attorney named Allison Banks, against all advice, defends the Barringtons, a group of slimeballs who let a herd of horses starve to death and only used them for profit. Nikki's firm suffered a major blow in its reputation, and Nikki fired and punched out Banks in short order. Then it turns out that Banks was essentially in bed with the Barringtons, the judge presiding over their case, receiving kickbacks from them, <em>and</em> was not really Allison Banks. It turned out that Allison died years ago, and that an imposter had assumed her identity. Unbelievable!
</li><li> Atty. Benjamin "Ben" Arcinas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallerAndSmallerCircles">Smaller &amp; Smaller Circles</a></em> certainly counts as one, since he prefers to chase the limelight with sensational cases involving high-profile victims instead of focusing on more important crimes. He almost callously dismisses the Payatas murders and even has a generic street urchin framed for them until the next murder surfaces and bites Arcinas in the ass, seriously jeopardizing his career. Oddly enough, he's never shown doing any actual legal work, even as simple as drawing up legal documents; in fact, he plays more of a detective role, albeit a fairly incompetent and self-serving one. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as Philippine lawyers are often appointed to various government posts, at times even to positions far beyond their strict area of legal expertise and often regardless of their actual administrative ability.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSweetHereafter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSweetHereafter">The Sweet Hereafter</a></em>: in the original novel by Russell Banks, Mitchell Stephens clearly comes across as one to many of the townsfolk. However, his reasoning is more complex: he's a shark in court, going after what he perceives as huge, uncaring entities who try to cut costs, in order to make it more expensive for them.
</li><li> Time Terminal 86 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeScout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeScout">Time Scout</a></em> doesn't allow lawyers on board, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">head of the station</a> doesn't like them.
</li><li> Lawrence Block's Martin Ehrengraf would frequently get his clients off by framing and murdering another person. His motto is "every one of my clients is innocent", which he believes so fervently he's willing to sink to any low to prove it.
</li><li> Edward St. John "Loophole" Latham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em>. No one can tell if the titular virus burned away his conscience or if he's naturally the best lawyer in the world. In a later book, it's implied that the wild card has nothing to do with him being the best lawyer in the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He contracts the virus, and is given the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a>, as well as create other Body Surfers by sexual intercourse.</span>
</li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YearZero">Year Zero</a></em> features lawyers in the music industry, examples of this trope abound considering that they all exist to exploit copyright law. One of which happens to be the protagonist.
</li><li> Willie Stark of <em>All the King's Men</em> is this, as well as a thinly-veiled allusion to the controversial Louisiana governor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HueyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HueyLong">Huey Long</a>. In a unique twist on the trope, he's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> who believes that he has to play dirty in order to do right by his clients and his constituents, but the moral strain of what he does drives him to alcoholism.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a></em> has Rauol Duke's traveling companion, the 300 pound Samoan lawyer Dr. Gonzo. He's greedy and self-indulgent, and spends most of the book out of his mind on drugs. He also gives terrible advice, which mainly consists of advising Duke to do drugs and break the law. He's based on the real life antipoverty and Latino rights lawyer Oscar Acosta, who was about as wild as Gonzo, but dedicated his life to more worthy causes.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Almost all the defense attorneys on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> shows would fit this trope like a glove. Incidentally, an episode of the show (Serena Southerlyn era) had an attorney on trial give a very stirring closing argument about why defense lawyers were necessary, even though everyone hates them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">He still was found guilty</a> for not reporting the location of his client's murder pit, though he reappeared about year later (with the implication that his conviction got overturned on appeal).
<ul><li> As well as some of the prosecutors. Jack "Hang 'Em High" McCoy, in particular, is known for hiding evidence, bullying witnesses, and generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">abusing the law</a> to get convictions. Although McCoy can generally be characterised as playing hard, but within legal limits, this isn't always the case. Withholding evidence, for example, is illegal when the evidence is sufficient to prove innocence (though <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/opinion/sunday/rampant-prosecutorial-misconduct.html">prosecutors have only rarely been punished for this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>). McCoy at least (usually) had the good graces to feel bad about some of his less proud moments, and also often has people telling him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">"YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!"</a> when he goes overboard.
</li><li> McCoy's replacement Michael Cutter was no less a manipulative jackass, and in a few occasions he was confronted by fellow members of the DA's office that, having worked with McCoy, could in all honesty tell Cutter that he was <em>worse</em>.
</li><li> If a defense attorney has a recurring role on the show, then he or she will probably be sympathetic or pure evil, in terms of pulling any trick up their sleeves to win. Most of them took their losses gratefully, and one wizened attorney expressed <em>relief</em> that his client—a rapist—was put away, as he has a daughter himself.
</li><li> One of the few exceptions is a recurring lawyer on <em>SVU</em> played by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001633/">Annie Potts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who gets brought in whenever the show decides to have a <em>really</em> sympathetic defendant.
<ul><li> And Stabler is sort of a one-man justification squad for the trope, proving that we actually <em>need</em> amoral attorneys. He's a protagonist and easy to sympathize with, but he does a lot of stuff that's ethically questionable (legally speaking, it's <em>not</em> questionable, it's flat out illegal).
</li><li> Barry Moredock (played by John Cullum) is a rare example of this kind of attorney cast in a positive light: He's a firm believer in constitutional rights and will defend someone whose rights he thinks are being violated, even if he personally thinks his client is a scumbag (one such client was a young Neo-Nazi who was known to hae murdered several people for no other reason than their ethnicity).
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting twist occurs in a episode where one of McCoy's subordinates is forced to act as a defense attorney. The moment she is teased for "working for the dark side", McCoy instantly lays down the law, saying that she is acting as a proper lawyer and any personnel of his office giving her a hard time for doing her duty would be punished with reassignment to traffic court.
</li><li> Paul Robinette, a former prosecutor for the first 3 seasons of the show came back as a reaccurring guest star and having become an amoral attorney in his absence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> decides to put this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to 11</a> with the first episode, with a barrister nicknamed "Limbo" for how low he'll go. So far, the other barristers have been of varying moral fibre.
</li><li> L&amp;O's definitive example has to be Ben Stone's nemesis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Arthur Gold</a>, who could (and did) often goad Stone into legal mistakes simply by looking like he was enjoying himself while defending obvious scumbags.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderTrialByJury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderTrialByJury">Trial By Jury</a></em> when Tracey Kibre talks to the opposing counsel:
<div class="indent"><strong>Norman Rothenberg</strong>: You're wasting your time in the DA's office. I could triple what you make.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Tracey Kibre</strong>: You don't want me, Norman. I have scruples.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Norman Rothenberg</strong>: They have pills for that.
</div></li><li> The killer in the episode "By Perjury" is a lawyer, and Cutter explicitly describes him as the adversarial system gone insane: he's willing to do <em>anything</em>, including murder, to win the massive lawsuit he's involved in. McCoy remarks that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">sounds like Cutter's evil twin</a>.
</li><li> One of the worst examples, on both sides of the fence, was "For The Defense"'s former ADA turned defense attorney for a mobster who had a long habit of putting contracts out on witnesses against his cases, then attempting to blackmail the DA's office to get out from under several recent murders.
</li><li> Then there's Dean "What're you offering" Connors, - McCoy says that Dean's not a <em>bad</em> attorney, he's just morally opposed to hard work and so will usually take any offer from the DA regardless of his client's guilt or innocence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> has the usual examples as prosecutors, as you'd expect of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForensicDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForensicDrama">Forensic Drama</a>. The notable example isn't a direct one, as Bones isn't an attorney, but the exact same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of the trope are explored in episode 1x08 <em>The Girl in the Fridge</em>; Bones and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFlame">Old Flame</a> turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rival">Rival</a> are opposing experts in a murder trial. Bones clinically delivers her conclusions, her ex makes somewhat less professional conclusions while chatting up the jury - and implies that Bones isn't really as smart as she sounds. In between sessions, her ex states that he's merely "playing the game" - he's supposed to argue that the evidence supports the defendant, just as she's for the prosecution. In-universe, Bones' consultant argues for impartiality and sweet-talking the jury, but sees nothing wrong with her ex using inside knowledge(which he got by <em>sleeping</em> with her) to attack her character instead of the evidence(the prosecution objects and the judge sustains<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yrfa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0yrfa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yrfa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="http://remediallawnotes.blogspot.com/2014/07/character-of-witnesses.html">Character of Witnesses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; "Personal opinions on the moral character of a witness, being usually too general, sweeping or subjective, are excluded." Bones' ex isn't saying that she's reading the evidence wrong, he's saying she's a lousy scientist. Such a broad accusation is <em>absolutely illegal</em> in a courtroom where she is not the defendant.</span>, but Brennan's consultant waves it off as a technicality; "He looks like a regular guy who's not allowed to speak the truth because the stupid rules get in the way."). This leads into the same Unfortunate Implications as Amoral Attorneys - that <em>scientists</em> aren't supposed to be impartial, but to have agreed in advance as to who is guilty no matter which side they're on.

The drama got a complaint from the head of the Bar Council, the UK's lawyer group. Peter Moffat responded that said head had recently punched his opponent, which is a rather weak response.
</li><li> Alan Shore started out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice">The Practice</a></em> (and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em>, although he became less scummy as the series went on) as an exemplary example of an Amoral Attorney. His unethical behavior caused him to be fired from the firm in The Practice, which he successfully sues and, after stealing client files, goes to Boston Legal's firm of Crane, Poole, and Schmidt. One of the best moments of his that shows just how amoral he is can be found halfway <a class="urllink" href="http://www.generationterrorists.com/cgi-bin/boston_legal.cgi?ep=104">down here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with him browbeating the nebbish store clerk who saw his client, a very wealthy woman and kleptomaniac, stuff a scarf into her purse:

Every secret place and insufficiency in the hours that you will spend in that witness chair, Miles, in front of all those friends you invited.

By the time I'm done, I'll have you believing you put that scarf in her handbag. Lee Tyler can afford to hire any attorney in the world. She's chosen me. Do you wonder if I'm any good, Miles?

Based on a famous real-life Melbourne lawyer, he's despised for defending copkiller Malcolm Hennessy, but is respected for his abilities as well — the main detective protagonist doesn't hesitate to recommend Kidd to a fellow officer who'd been accused of police brutality. On another occasion, Kidd is assigned to defend a child molester, and though Kidd listens to his briefing with a cold silence quite unlike his usual 'average bloke' demeanour, he still defends him well.
</li><li> The protagonists of both the classic courtroom drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">spiritual successor</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock">Matlock</a></em>, handle legal morality a very odd way. While both Perry Mason and Ben Matlock are successful and honorable defense attorneys, they always win by uncovering the real guilty party and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerryMasonMethod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerryMasonMethod">dramatically presenting</a> proof of their guilt in court. In other words, in order to redeem his role as a defense attorney, each hero has to also do the prosecutor's job, and offer up someone else to take the innocent defendant's place in jail. Prosecuting attorneys and rival lawyers in both shows are likely to fit this trope perfectly.

In addition to abusing his loved ones and driving his wife to drink, he threatened to throw her into a sanitarium if she tried to leave.

Backstory holds that he eventually broke with the Ha'la'tha and became a civil-liberties lawyer; he's the one who taught Lampkin that even the lowest, guiltiest scumbag deserves a good defense.
</li><li> Jeff Winger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> is an unapologetic version of this trope...at least for now.

But as her relationship with Jimmy strengthens, she begins compromising her morals and professional ethics a lot, but she is really remorseful of this and trys to balance her karma by taking pro bono public defense cases as she grows disillusioned with her career in banking law. She completely falls into this trope by the end of Season 5 when she plans to frame Howard and destroy his career to get the money from the Sandpiper case.
</li><li> While Howard Hamlin is pretty much a straight-arrow lawyer through and through, his concealment of the truth about Chuck's illness from his clients falls into this as that's the sort of activity that should leave him and everyone at HHM subject to disciplinary hearings and malpractice suits.
</li><li> Chuck McGill continually hides behind "letter of the law" and "spirit of the law" in his efforts to undermine Jimmy, and proves to be petty and vindictive, as shown by his reaction when Howard decides he has to go in response to his illness becoming public knowledge and the insurance company wanting to hike their malpractice premiums.

A female prosecutor seen in the first few episodes is called out on it when she tries to get a full guilty verdict on a client that she knows is not guilty.

In the resulting trial, the defense lawyer gets his client off with a well reasoned argument based on clear legal decisions, but his only response to the client afterward is that the defendant will get his bill. Furthermore, the defense lawyer makes it clear to Reed that he is as committed to his own binding oath to serve his necessary role in the Justice System as the officer is.

The lawyer Brenda hires is a brilliant but morally ambiguous ex-district attorney who was forced out because of his methods and the opposing council was an equally devious attorney who's case was largely bolstered by an anonymous leak in the LAPD which made him aware of a good amount of morally ambiguous behavior on the part of Brenda.
<ul><li> Deconstructed with a recurring villain, a defense attorney for sex offenders who may or may not be a rapist himself and teaming up with his clients to drug and rape women with their help. In the end however, it turns out that he's innocent of the rapes after one of his victims identifies a bartender as the accomplice of the guy who raped her and several other women. His final appearance leaves it vague towards whether or not he was truly innocent though as he threatens to sue the department and Brenda if they don't leave him alone (as Brenda and her fellow detectives had, after their first encounter, made a point to tell anyone who brought his name up, that he was a sexual predator, damaging his reputation as a result).

In order to do so, she forged a document where said brother allegedly signed over everything to her to protect him from being tricked by gold-diggers. Her accomplice suggested hiring a <em>honest</em> lawyer to take the case to the courts because: a) honest lawyers would be less likely to figure out the document was a fake; b) even dishonest lawyers would refuse the case once they figured out; and c) the more regarded their lawyer would be for honesty, the more likely would be their chances a judge would rule in their favor.

<ul><li>Matt Murdock himself is a very good lawyer. But to go after criminals like Wilson Fisk, he often combines his lawyer work with his nighttime activities as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. Foggy also finds himself having to compromise his morals when covering for Matt.
</li><li> Samantha Reyes, the District Attorney for Manhattan, will go through anything, including illegal measures, to get by. As Matt Murdock puts it, Reyes wouldn't even buy a pack of gum if it didn't further her career. Likewise, Karen uncovers that Reyes has a habit of backstabbing her own associates to save her own ass.

When we first meet her, she seems selfish and mostly interested in her own career. However, she has standards, and Foggy's appeals to how she used to "have a soul" lead her to turn against her bosses, who are deep in Wilson Fisk's pockets. It earns her a much better job at Hogarth Chao &amp; Benowitz.
</li><li> Sadly, Marci's the only Landman &amp; Zack attorney to actually have a soul. In a flashback in "Nelson v. Murdock," the firm is shown suing a plaintiff who became severely sick for working for Roxxon Oil. They sue for "damages" after the man told his doctor about his work to find out what had made him sick. Parish Landman claims that the man had violated his confidentiality agreement by sharing this info with his doctor. Matt and Foggy are so disgusted by this that they decide to start their own firm as a result. In the present day, Parish Landman is on Wilson Fisk's payroll, and is among those arrested by the FBI when Marci and Hoffman turn on Fisk.
</li><li> Big Ben Donovan is a <em>criminal</em> lawyer to many prominent members of New York City's criminal underworld. In particular, Wilson Fisk and Mariah Dillard.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em>, Donovan is revealed to have been the Stokes family's lawyer ever since Mama Mabel groomed him and put him through law school. In the first season, he makes time to get Cottonmouth out of jail after Cottonmouth is arrested for killing Scarfe. He is later sent by Mariah Dillard to interrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Misty Knight</a>'s interrogation of Candace Miller, to make sure that Candace sticks to the false story Shades is paying her to give to the police <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">implicating Luke in Cottonmouth's murder</span>.
</li><li> In the second season he gets much, much worse. When Mariah appears to have run out of money because Bushmaster bankrupted her, he immediately declares he will no longer be representing her or Shades... while both of them are in custody and being questioned by the police. This is known as "abandonment of a client," and is grounds for disbarment in New York State. He then goes to work for his former client's opponents in a legal (as well as illegal) dispute, also grounds for disbarment. Then when he realizes Bushmaster is more likely to kill him than pay him, he goes back to his old client and does what he not only should have done instead of leaving his old client in the lurch, but should have advised Mariah to do before the temporary cash flow issue came up in the first place (namely, report that Piranha Jones, the guy with power of attorney over Mariah's assets, had been kidnapped; and freeze his ability to make money transfers, on the grounds that duress invalidates any and all such transactions).
</li><li> Donovan is a bit less involved in the day to day operations of Fisk's criminal enterprises. In season 2 of <em>Daredevil</em>, it seems that outside of arranging money transfers like setting up a protection fund for Vanessa or the movement of funds to ensure a guard gets Frank Castle to blow his trial to meet Fisk, he's not too involved in the organization. As season 3 shows, most of the shady street stuff in Fisk's outfit is handled by Felix Manning, with Donovan and his partner Nicholas Lee (who according to Donovan's actor Danny Johnson is Donovan's insurance policy) primarily being invested in using legal means to help Fisk re-obtain "Rabbit in a Snowstorm".

She is willing to hire a clearly unstable Jessica Jones for private investigation work (even wants to bring her in-house), and even is willing to try using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Kilgrave</a> to get her ex-spouse Wendy to agree to lesser assets in their divorce. This backfires <em>hard</em> on Jeri, as Wendy gets killed and her secretary/mistress Pam gets thrown in jail. The whole ordeal with Kilgrave leads Jeri to clean up her act, and when she turns up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em>, she's a much nicer person, who helps Danny Rand reclaim his identity and turns out to have also tended to the Rand estate after Danny's parents were killed. Of course, season 2 of <em>Jessica Jones</em> sees Jeri resort to her old tricks: her response to being conned by Inez and Shane is to buy a gun from Turk Barrett and manipulate Inez into murdering Shane. And she blackmails Chao and Benowitz into giving her a larger buyout offer.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Miles Edgeworth</a>: Perfection-obsessed, but undergoes a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> by the end of the game, is nice to Phoenix outside of court for the rest of the series. Even after this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, he does what he needs to to bring out the truth, and can get really cold when doing this. Two shining examples are when he brought up a sensitive issue to get a tight-lipped witness to testify (when we say "sensitive issue", we mean that the witness attempted suicide because of it before) and when he suggested that the defendant, who was eleven years old at the time, after committing the crime, tried to use a machine to brutally dismember the body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aside from the fact that said girl didn't murder anyone, he was actually <em>completely right</em>- the girl thought her mother was no different than the robots, and that the machine could fix her.</span>
</li><li> Manfred von Karma: the page image and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">pretty much the ULTIMATE in amoral attorneys</a> - considered a "god of prosecution", he went for forty years undefeated, and was not above resorting to illegal/immoral methods to achieve a guilty verdict, habitually forging evidence and tampering with witnesses. Von Karma was also so obsessed with perfection that when a defense attorney got him penalized in court for the first and only time in his entire career, he took a six-month vacation - also his first and only. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The real reason for the vacation was to cover his tracks after he was accidentally shot in the shoulder when he killed the defense attorney responsible.</span> In what is perhaps the most shining example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> in video game history, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he then proceeded to raise the victim's son to be a twisted opposite of everything his father stood for, only to have him accused of <em>his own father's murder</em> right before the statute of limitations on the murder ran out, all to get revenge on the victim!</span>
</li><li> The murderer of a defense attorney in the fourth case of <em>Ace Attorney</em> committed the crime because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the defense lawyer in question, Robert Hammond, was an Amoral Attorney that convinced him to plead Insanity in court even though he was truly innocent- as a former colleague points out, Hammond never truly believed in his clients. The defendant lost everything that mattered to him as a result of this, and jumped at the chance for revenge</span>.
</li><li> Franziska von Karma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyJusticeForAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyJusticeForAll">Justice for All</a></em>: Perfection-obsessed too, coupled with an obsession with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">succeeding where her adopted brother (Miles Edgeworth) failed, as doing so will make her feel worthy of the von Karma name, as she felt that the adopted Edgeworth had always been better than her</span>. She also badgers witnesses, either with threats of legal action or with her whip. However, like Edgeworth, she seems to be doing her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was an irreplaceable aid to the <em>defense</em> in Case 3-5. The only time she aided the prosecution was when she herself was prosecutor</span>.
</li><li> In the fourth case of <em>Justice For All</em>, this is a major plot point: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phoenix himself eventually figures out that his client is guilty of hiring an assassin, but his partner is being held hostage by that same assassin to get a not guilty verdict, since the assassin has a reputation to keep up. Phoenix goes through much handwringing about what the right thing to do is, especially since his opponent Edgeworth is fresh off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, and letting the client get off would most likely result in an innocent woman being convicted of the murder. Eventually, the player is forced to make a decision between guilty and not guilty when it looks like the attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> has been crushed. The choice doesn't actually affect anything, as just before Phoenix speaks up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">somebody comes to save the day</a>.

</li><li> In <em>Gyakuten Kenji 2</em>, we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prosecutor Blaise Debeste. He ran an illegal auction, selling evidence of past cases to anonymous bidders. He also murdered two people and was part of the group that ordered the assassination of Di-jun Huang, the same incident that ruined the House of Lang's reputation as reputable investigators. He was also the Chief Prosecutor who gave von Karma his only penalty, even though Debeste was the one who provided the forged evidence, and von Karma hadn't known for a change that the evidence was forged</span>.
</li><li> While Winston Payne didn't venture over here, his brother, Gaspen Payne, introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em>, is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> as a prosecutor, and takes pride in it, calling himself the "Rookie/Defendant Humiliator". At one point, he takes the time to badger the defendant into admitting her guilt, causing the Judge to sustain Athena's objection when his badgering drives her to tears. The post-credits scene also reveals that he actually is more than willing to use questionable methods, leading to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him getting looked into by Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth</span>. He returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, where he turns out to have fled to a country that has outlawed defence attorneys simply so he can never lose. When Phoenix Wright decides to go up against him, Gaspen allows it but does not tell him about the Defence Culpability Act and how he will be executed under it if he fails. He even calls for giving the death penalty to <em>a nine-year old child</em> to get Phoenix killed along with him as revenge for his loss in <em>Dual Destinies</em>.
</li><li> Simon Blackquill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Dual Destinies</a></em> has no problem with threatening witnesses to ensure their cooperation, psychologically manipulating everyone in the courtroom, attacking the defense with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind">Razor Wind</a>, and siccing his pet hawk on everyone. Oh, and he's a <em>convicted murderer.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In actuality, he framed himself for his mentor's murder to protect her traumatized daughter - Athena. Despite being <em>a day away from execution</em>, he doesn't fight back because his death will ensure Athena's safety. He also proves to be firmly on the side of the truth, as he psychologically manipulates the phantom in order to get Athena the chance she needs to prove his identity. He also does not use many dirty tricks when he is prosecuting.</span>
</li><li> Aristotle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Means</a> is an amoral attorney <em>teacher</em>, who genuinely believes any and all methods, no matter how unethical or illegal, must be used in order to achieve a goal. To him, the end justifies the means, no matter what. Fortunately, by the time the trial he's introduced in is over, the students realize he was full of crap, and set out to fix the damage he's done. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact he murdered a fellow professor after being confronted for taking bribes certainly doesn't do him any favors.</span>
</li><li> Phoenix Wright himself stays on the 'protagonist' side of the line, but if he's your lawyer, he will believe in your innocence and defend you to the bitter end <em>whether you want him to or not</em>. He has defended multiple clients who wanted to plead guilty (Lana Skye, Ron DeLite, etc.) This is mostly because of his undying belief that his clients aren't guilty of their accusations, though. Thus, his acquaintances are more likely to call him the "Illogical Attorney", rather than amoral. The only time we catch a slight wind of this is in case 6-5 "Turnabout Revolution", when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>sues Apollo's client</em> and supports his case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">obviously falsified testimony</a>, especially since the plaintiff is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Sleazy Politician</a>.

</li><li> Played straight, if comically, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Often representing Mr. Burns is the Blue-Haired Lawyer, a pastiche of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> scumbag Roy Cohn. He is always competent and cold, as in this exchange following Lisa's brilliant suggestion to a TV executive (from "The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochy Show" - 1997):
<div class="indent"><strong>George Meyers, Jr.:</strong> That's it... That's it, little girl! You just saved <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em>!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lawyer:</strong> Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em>.
</div><ul><li> Note that Mr. Burns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">really doesn't like him</a>, nor does he like the rest of his legal team, as proven by the way he yelled at them in "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" (When he needed legal advice from them, no less.)
</li><li> It should also be noted that the Blue-Haired Lawyer, unlike some of the examples below, seems truly amoral (not immoral) at times. He brought his usual competency to bear while representing Bart when Bart pursued legal emancipation from his family due to financial and other grievances against Homer, no matter his actual feelings about the situation: when Bart declared that he wanted to legally separate from his family in his office, his <em>"You are?!"</em> seems to imply he is aghast; when Bart repeats himself, however, the Blue-Haired Lawyer reveals that he understood him perfectly and was merely calling his assistant who is named "Youare" to get him the necessary forms.
</li><li> One Halloween episodes has him writing all the legal paper to allow Mr. Burns to hunt his guests, as killing is part of Burns' religion and they are on a hunting zone. Burns shoots him the moment he is finished with the paper. It's not like he didn't see it coming the lawyer was invited purposefully to be hunted and his instinct kicked in.
</li><li> On the other hand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceLimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceLimbo">sadly now retired</a> character Lionel Hutz is an <em>incompetent</em> example of this trope, often put up against the Blue-Haired Lawyer and rarely winning unless he's lucky.
</li><li> "When will you humans learn that <em>feelings</em>, as you call them, can get in the way of big cash pay offs? Bwahahahaha!"—spoken by a divorce lawyer (not the Blue-Haired Lawyer) to Manjula, in the episode where she found that Apu was cheating on her.
</li></ul></li><li> Another less-than-competent example is Kyle Broslovski's lawyer father, Gerald, who nonetheless proceeds to help Eric Cartman and a number of other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> children bankrupt the local school system through a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits</a>, the money from which he uses to build a huge mansion for his family.

His personal life is also devoted to being as controversial as possible, being a polygamist and married to a man among other things.
</li><li> Charles Foster Offdensen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> will do anything to keep the highly popular Dethklok safe and to protect their IP. Even if it means paying people if the band offended them, kidnapping minor offenders and threaten them with keeping silent. If it did not work, well let's just say that they'll be tortured, created a new identity and dumped in the middle of nowhere. Hell, he even has an entire military police force to scope out people pirating Dethklok music. He's so good with his job that he could be an efficient dictator if he wants.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AdventuresInOdyssey">Adventures in Odyssey</a></em> centered on John Avery Whittaker being falsely accused of cat burglary and being saddled with one of these for his defense lawyer, who does nothing whatever to defend his client—his final statement boils down to theatrically declaring, "GUILTY! <em>GUILTY!!</em> <em><strong>GUILTY!!!</strong></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Thank you very much.</a>"—and tries to stop Dylan from showing the presiding judge definitive evidence of Whittaker's innocence just as the verdict is being delivered.
