Then the Big Bad removes his mask to reveal... he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">that big kid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">who kept stealing your lunch money</a> when you were in third grade. And now he's all grown up and wants more... apparently, that's what this whole conquering the world thing is about.
</p><p>The Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up comes along when that character who made your life hell when you were in school grows up into a more formidable adult antagonist. If you were in grade school with him, then he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthyKid">Mouthy Kid</a>. If you were in high school with him, then he was probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>. If he is a "she", then she was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>. Either way, the character hasn't matured one iota, but can now do a lot worse damage.
</p><p>An alternate version is someone who wasn't <em>quite</em> a bully but still holds a grudge against you for something you did back in school. ("Remember when you took Cindy to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance">High-School Dance</a>? That should've been <em>me</em>! Meet my <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>!") The Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickOnSomeoneYourOwnSize">hate your children</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">for absolutely no reason</a>, even if they're nothing like you. Somewhat cruelly, this character seems especially likely to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTeacher">one of your kid's schoolteachers</a>. If the story is told from the children's perspective, then all this will be a backstory.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Often a result of the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneWentToSchoolTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneWentToSchoolTogether">Everyone Went to School Together</a>. A previously established villain may be revealed to be one of these when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies">Spinoff Babies</a> are created.
</p><p>Sometimes, but not always, these types of characters are accompanied by the same people they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship">friends</a> with, when they were younger. If this is the case, these friends will likely take the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>.
</p><p>And if the hero is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> (or just particularly resentful for what the bully put them through in the past) and is giving the bully-turned-bad guy a serious beating, expect him/her to enjoy the beatdown they're giving and say something like "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that" or something to that effect.
</p><p>Sometimes subverted by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedBully">the one-time bully growing up into a sensible, responsible adult</a> who holds no ill will towards his schoolyard nemeses, something which sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">happens in real life.</a> This can also be subverted by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyTurnedBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyTurnedBuddy">the adult bully becoming a friend to the former victim</a>, even if they haven't necessarily grown up.

It is, however, more complicated — the man was a child psychologist by trade and was originally quite willing to not hold any grudge over the said bully. So, when the said ex-bully went to college and happened to live close with the said man, they were originally quite friendly. It was <em>only</em> after noticing this trope has been played straight that he decided to kill the ex-bully.

<ul><li> Subversions occur at least twice in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a>, both times with the gang hearing about an old friend returning to town, and then they (or at least Archie specifically) get freaked out thinking that the guy's gonna whomp 'em but good. These two stories are of the few times that <em>Archie</em> specifically tied its mythology to <em>Little Archie</em>:
<ul><li> Subversion: When Fangs Fogarty came back to town, he turned out to be a large young man, as could've been predicted from his childhood size. But he holds no ill will toward the gang — in fact, he sheds a tear over old times — and he's lost his nickname, thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dental surgery</span>. The group parts amicably.
</li><li> Double Subversion (?): When Ambrose Pipps came by, Archie recalled all the times he'd bullied and marginalized that poor little long-suffering kid, all the times he'd broken promises and refused Ambrose's well-meaning help — plus the times he'd made Ambrose cry. He started thinking about Ambrose having grown into a huge adult who would get Archie back for treating him bad all those years. Yet it turns out that Ambrose, true to his character, remembers only the good side of his childhood — and when Archie brings up the bad stuff, he shrugs it off.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> story <em>Street Demonz</em>, there is a flashback of young Bruce being accosted and beaten by the titular gang. In the modern day, he confronts the gang again as Batman and even gets to punch out the guy who had beaten him up years ago (even quipping that the guy hasn't changed at all).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, Cliff Carmichael was the intellectual tormenter of Ronnie Raymond (the teenager who would become the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Firestorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Firestorm">Firestorm</a>). Carmichael eventually became the supervillain the New Thinker.
</li><li> Subverted with Brittany, who bullies the title character in <em>Earthboy Jacobus</em>. By the time she grows up, she is not only on better terms with Jacobus but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to him as well</span>.
<ul><li> It kind of helps that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although she spends several years in a coma, they can communicate while Jake is on a different plane of existence. By the time she wakes up, she's fallen in love with him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted with Flash Thompson, originally a rampaging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>, who comes back from his overseas military service much wiser and more mature. He actually forms a friendship with one-time target Peter Parker, as both men have grown since their high school days. Flash was never all that bad compared to other bullies. He later becomes a superhero in his own right, as Agent Venom.
</li><li> Played straight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis">Garth Ennis</a> story, "The Thousand", where the villain turns out to be a guy who bullied Peter when they were kids. He saw Peter get bitten by the spider and saw his first display of powers. He then promptly went back and <em>ate</em> the dead spider, hoping that'd give him Spider-Man powers. Instead, he turned into a thousand spiders that could take over a person by eating them from the inside.
</li><li> Played very straight with Tombstone, who bullied Joe "Robbie" Robertson when they were at school together, and grew up to be a full-fledged supervillain.

However, few people know his original intended origin: he was a young rival of Cyclops who couldn't age. By the time Cyclops was an adult, Kid Sinister was still stuck as an 8-year-old (physically and mentally), and he used his mutant powers to change his appearance into that of a gaudy, over-the-top supervillain: an 8-year-old's vision of a cool supervillain. When considering that origin, Mr. Sinister's corny appearance, unimpressive name, and stereotypical supervillain demeanor actually make sense. But, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowersThatBe">The Powers That Be</a> decided not to go with that origin... It also explains his minions: The Nasty Boys (a name an 8-year-old would be <em>far</em> more likely to pick than a mad geneticist) earn their name by being filthy ultra-slobs, living in conditions akin to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> version of the Brotherhood. In other words, they never take baths or clean their space — part of an 8-year-old's idea of perfect freedom. In the canon version, one has to presume that the Nasty Boys named themselves rather than being named by Sinister and that he just uses them as minions because it would be no great loss if they get killed.

Eventually drummed out of the service, he uses his family's power to have Harrington's lover legally assassinated in a duel just to get back at her. Her shooting the bastard dead was one of the more satisfying book endings in the early part of the series.

Years later, Brone invites Natch into his office, uses virtual reality to play mind games with Natch, then brags about how he's not holding any grudges because he's forgiven him because he's so morally superior, and asks Natch to cooperate with him in an important business matter.

Naturally, the main character, who is the investigating police detective, meets his own school bully, also a detective, who ends up spying on and interfering in the main character's investigation in order to try and get his rapidly failing career back on track. In a confrontation, the bully reveals why he picked on and hates the main character so much; the main character assumed it was because he was a bit of a dorky outcast at school, but the bully reveals that it was actually because, compared to the bully's own self-loathing and mixed-up insecurity (prompted by, amongst other things, his homosexuality), the main character was always self-assured, confident, and secure in his own skin, and never let anyone — particularly the bully — affect this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The bully ends up becoming a victim of the serial killer himself.</span>

This motivation is subject to some heavy lampshading towards the end, where one character points out at the end of a fist just how pathetic this is. It's also to be taken with a grain of salt, as there are some indications that what Doc says happened and what <em>did</em> happen are two very different things.

When Jimmy and Frank go to confront the bully in the present day, it turns out he underwent a sex change and is now a woman, because he realized he was unhappy as a guy and that was the real reason he became a bully. Jimmy is understanding, but Frank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">sucker-punches the former bully anyway</a>.

It was only marred by a bully who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">came back as a homicidal rule-breaking ghost who was killing bullies. The bully <em>himself</em> thought he was the victim because he was teased after Young!Sam beat him up defending himself</span>.

When Doug Penhall recounts his particularly bitter memories of such a tormentor, a friend suggests he seek the bully out and confront him. However, when Penhall does just that by finding the bully's current home, he learns that the bully is now a pathetic unemployed loser with an unhappy marriage to a shrewish wife. Delighted at this turn of events, Penhall decides not to speak to him and returns home quietly gloating how he got the classic best revenge by living well.

Evidently. Roggvir managed to even put a beehive in Sorex's bed. The fact that he continued tormenting Sorex meant that he was glad to see Roggvir get his head chopped off.

He goes over to give the guy a piece of his mind and isn't pleased when Teezo can't even remember him. Then it turns out that while he doesn't remember Francis specifically, he knows what a jerk he was and only came to the reunion to apologise to people.

At school, she apparently bullied Gipsy (although this was justified in Shanna's mind as Gipsy stole a boyfriend of hers), she bullied TKO (while the two were out on their graduation mission), and she stole Carlita's lunch money (vengeance for which was exacted with brutal precision). Even today, she still prefers to deal with things with force and fists than reasoning and talking.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>: Growing up, Stan Smith was bullied by a big Greek kid named Stelio Kontos. When Stan tries to be his own son Steve's bully in an attempt to toughen him up, Steve finds Stelio (who now works at Klinko's) and hires him to beat Stan up.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BackAtTheBarnyard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BackAtTheBarnyard">Back at the Barnyard</a></em> episode sees Otis dreading the arrival of an old bully.

When the other characters attempt to gang up on him in defense, the duck beats them all silly. Then the duck simply says that he has had therapy and just wanted to do was apologize to Otis for bullying him.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> revealed that when Dog was a pup, he was beaten down by a paperboy who was too fast for him. When a new mailman appeared and Dog was unable to catch him, he went into a deep depression until Cat snapped him out of it. During the final showdown with the mailman, it was revealed he was the same paperboy. In the end, Dog took a chunk out of his pants, regaining his drive and settling his childhood trauma.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> had Drake go to his high school reunion and meet the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> who made his life miserable for years; only now, they're rich and successful and <em>still</em> treat him like crap (and for bonus points, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo">they idolize Darkwing</a>). During a fight with Megavolt (who also attended the school), DW's mask comes off and the bullies make fun of him some more. In the end, he saves the day they apologize for the way they acted and for not recognizing that he was a good person, and promise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">to keep his secret</a> (he says thanks, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">uses hypnosis to erase their memories</a> anyway).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> had an episode where Peter wanted revenge on his high school bully, only to discover that he's now crippled by multiple sclerosis. Peter still tries to beat him up, but Chris intervenes and points out to Peter that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">he himself has become a bully</a>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a>,</em> Johnny gets a visit from Mr. T, who's visiting to answer a letter Johnny sent him when he was a kid to help stop a bully who was picking on him. Mr. T helps Johnny toughen up and goes to confront the bully, who turned out grew up to become Richard Simmons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>, it turns out that we have the 'classmate with a grudge seeking revenge' version: Doctor Drakken, Kim's arch-foe, goes after the three guys who laughed at him in college, driving him to drop out and starting his slide into evil. The trio are all physicists and their ringleader? Kim's dad.
<ul><li> The crime? Mocking Drakken's freaky robot 'dates'. Granted, this one is more personal because the three guys, including Dr. Mr. Possible, were all <em>friends</em> with Drakken. It wasn't just the laughing at him, but feeling backstabbed by his former friends.
</li><li> There's also the 'camp bully' version with Gill, who used to be Gil before overexposure to Camp Wannaweep's polluted lake mutated him. Apparently, he was Ron's cabinmate before he and Ron made a switch in their activities. Given how Ron never saw Gil again, this is probably where Ron ended up bunking with the monkey mascot of Lake Wannaweep that gave him his fear of monkeys.
</li></ul></li><li> There's an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a></em> where an old school friend of Ren's comes to visit him. However, over the course of a few flashbacks, it's revealed the "friend" humiliated him at every opportunity and made him miserable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>: Rocko spends an episode dreading a visit from his childhood bully Dingo, and training so he could finally fight back, but as it turns out, Dingo wants to make peace with him. Oh, and he's a member of a weird pacifistic cult, and <em>insists</em> on making amends by letting Rocko punch him in the face. Rocko did so and Dingo would leave. However, as soon as Rocko went back inside, Rocko's friends (Heffer and Filburt) started beating up Dingo.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Pre-School" from season 8, a bully who the boys had sent to juvenile detention for an offense they committed returns a hardened criminal and bent on revenge. Fortunately for the boys, they find a way to pin another offense on him and get him sent away again. To be fair, Trent Boyett wasn't so much a bully as he was a tough loner. And the crime that was pinned on him was so heinous (accidentally lighting a sweet preschool teacher on fire and turning her into a paralyzed, catatonic wreck) that you can't really blame Trent for wanting to dole out a few "titty-twisters." (The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">"Texas Chili Bowl"</a>, however, is another story....)
<ul><li> Actually, Trent was already a known troublemaker, given the teacher asking what did he do now.. The offense was more than the boys wanted to play fireman so they asked Trent Boyett to light something on fire and the boys tried to pee on it to put it out. While it was an accident, the boys did play the whole thing as it was his whole fault (and to be fair, he did ultimately start the fire). He became much worse out of juvie given his rampage. Furthermore, he probably would've gone back to juvie for getting his revenge (given he gave Butters, the only other kid who knew what happened as a bystander, a trip to the hospital.)
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> had Orson fearing an old bully of his who is coming to "settle" with him. He finally faces him...where he returns all the lunch money he stole from him.
</li><li> The "classmate with a grudge seeking revenge" version occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> when Dr. Venture, Brock Samson, Baron Ünderbheit, and Pete White get kidnapped by their old college classmate Mike Sorayama, who holds grudges against all of them. Although his revenge is elaborate and impressive, it's all a bit much considering that the things he hates them for are all pretty minor, most of which revolve around his pathetic unrequited crush on an attractive classmate and their teasing of him for it. Worst of all, the thing he hates Venture for was something he didn't even really do<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qe1k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qe1k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qe1k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he thinks Doc slept with the girl, but it was his roommate Brock who really did</span>.
