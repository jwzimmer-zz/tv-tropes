<div class="indent">— <strong>Alexander Pope</strong>, <em>An Essay on Criticism</em>
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Forgiveness is perhaps the hardest thing anyone can do, because the things that truly need forgiving are usually those that hurt the deepest. Then again, has the offender really earned forgiveness? Do they have to? Or is forgiveness for such a sin even possible? Is there such a thing as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">unforgivable sin?</a> And just to complicate things further, who's to say forgiveness is a good thing in this situation, or <em>at all?</em>
</p><p>So it is that this cornerstone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> causes a lot of problems to all involved, storyteller included.
</p><p>The necessity of Forgiveness and its effects are all over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>. While it commonly appears as the best choice, it's not anywhere near universal. It should probably be noted that <strong>every</strong> major real world religion insists forgiveness is necessary from its practitioners.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Again, this is a very difficult trope to pull off, depending on who the players are, what the offense was, and what the ramifications were.
</p><p></p><h2>The typical aesop is as follows:</h2>
<ol><li> Characters with a legitimate grievance who want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> shouldn't exact it. It just perpetuates the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">makes them into monsters as bad as their targets</a>. To get true emotional closure, they should forgive the offender.
</li><li> They shouldn't take revenge... but if they do, it doesn't make them monsters, and is in fact perfectly fine and justified method of gaining Justice. Usually, this story has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti Heroes</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> of a bad guy because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>.
</li><li> They not only can, but <em>should</em> take revenge. It will not only give them emotional closure, but will be a long overdue public service since the offender is seriously messed up. Yet they don't and are often taken advantage of because of their inaction. This is used to illustrate the limits of forgiveness or a cultural status-quo ripe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><h2>The effects of (not) taking revenge:</h2>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Not taking revenge will spiritually cleanse the characters</a>, allowing such things as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsLife">Redemption Equals Life</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> on the one spared and (if they weren't heroes) the protagonists.
</li><li> Not taking revenge will emotionally destroy the characters ... at least in the short run. In the long run they might be better off, unless the overarching aesop is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">The Farmer and the Viper</a>.
</li><li> Taking revenge does no lasting mental or emotional damage, perhaps even healing emotional scars, but it does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">morally bankrupt the characters</a>.
</li><li> Taking revenge does lasting emotional damage <em>and</em> morally bankrupts the characters.
<ul><li> Alternatively, taking revenge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty">will ultimately feel hollow and not bring the characters any kind of emotional closure</a>, and they will have morally bankrupted themselves in vain.
</li></ul></li><li> Not taking revenge empowers the offending party (the proposed targets of said revenge), and the offender will come back again and again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">knowing they won't suffer any repercussions for their actions.</a>
</li></ul><p>A story pushing the most idealist of these by having the heroes forgive and pardon the trespassers commonly has said trespassers indignantly refuse the forgiveness and outstretched hand with treachery. This being fiction, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> from spurning their generosity results in them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">getting eaten by a bigger fish</a>, shot/stabbed by the heroes or any less forgiving companions who were on their guard, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain">choosing to die</a> rather than live with the wounded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">having accepted their help.</a>
</p><p>It's not uncommon for sadistic heroes to "forgive" the bad guy with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">Cruel Mercy</a> that makes it impossible to harm anyone ever again.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: #2 hero Enji Todoroki/Endeavor went to insane lengths to surpass his "rival" All Might, including marrying a woman specifically so they would have powerful children, neglecting the kids who weren't strong enough for his tastes, and physically and emotionally abusing the one who was, his fourth child Shoto. After an important event (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All Might's retiring from heroics</span>), Endeavor is forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">confront all the reprehensible things he did in pursuit of his goal</a> and resolves to become a better hero <em>and</em> a better man and starts trying to make amends to his family. They've still got decades of abuse to work through (his wife is still in a mental hospital after his abuse lead to her pouring scalding water on Shoto's face), but the family acknowledges that he legitimately seems to be trying, and Endeavor knows that <em>if</em> they ever forgive him it won't be for a very long time. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Midoriya learns about it, he believes that Shoto is too kind of a person to not forgive his father eventually, but that he is still preparing himself to do so, meanwhile, Endeavor acknowledged the fact that his second youngest son, Natsuo, will probably never forgive him, and makes peace with it.
</li><li> In one arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> manga and anime, a little boy's big brother dies protecting him from some bad guys. The little boy gets the chance to take revenge by killing one of the bad guys (who is unconscious), but is convinced not to: it wouldn't give him his brother back, and it would destroy him emotionally (basically bullet point 4 above). Instead, he should live a life that would make his brother proud of him, protecting those weaker than himself and not giving in to evil.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Athrun</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">joins the good guys</a>, Miriallia overhears a conversation between him and Kira and learns that it was him who killed her boyfriend Tolle. When questioned about how she feels about this, Miriallia just walks away, saying that revenge won't change anything, thus becoming the first character in the show to actually forgive a misguided enemy.
<ul><li> Earlier and in the biggest display of Kira's new attitude he's confronted by Yzak at Alaska and Kira in his new Freedom is able to easily overpower his older Duel Gundam and line up a kill shot, and despite Kira having the fresh memory of Yzak blowing away that shuttle of civilians earlier he changes his attack to only damage Duel slightly and tosses Yzak clear of the battlefield, telling him to save himself. Yzak is stunned and it begins his character development of second guessing his views that all Naturals are evil scum that deserve to die, leading his side switching in the finale.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny</a></em>, Kira offers friendship and an alliance to Shinn Asuka, who has spent a good part of the series trying very hard to kill him. Shinn actually breaks down crying when he realizes that Kira honestly doesn't hold a grudge against him for this, or for anything else he's done.
</li><li> In another instance <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, Saji Crossroad follows Aesop 1 and tried his damnedest to get Louise Halevy to follow his footsteps. Unfortunately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louise ignores him and goes on to exact righteous vengeance on her parents' murderer Nena Trinity. She ends up in effects 4, for a short while until her mentality and moral gets restored by Setsuna's GN Particles, and Saji's persistence</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> taking revenge makes Team Ten and especially Shikamaru grow up and get over their grief (although it's largely motivated by finishing the mission that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asuma</span> died trying to complete). It's Aesop three.
<ul><li> Sasuke on the other hand leans <em>very</em> heavily on Aesop three <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the point of wanting to kill his entire home town for the actions of few elders.</span> Tough to say how he'll end up.

<ul><li> Earlier in the series, after Heero is duped into killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Alliance</a> leaders who wanted to pursue peace with the space colonies (the very reason he was fighting in the first place), he goes around to their families confessing his guilt and offering them a gun. After this has happened, Field Marshall Noventa's widow asks Relena to deliver a letter to Heero, asking him to stop beating himself up over an honest mistake and encouraging him to think about the future rather than fixating on the past.

One father is almost killed by gangsters in the Mob, but the Weeping Woman saves him by killing them.

<ul><li> This valuable lesson is promptly forgotten in subsequent books; or more precisely, the protagonists never attempt to apply it to anyone besides one another.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, a woman who had committed adultery, which Jewish law of the time demanded being stoned to death, was brought before Jesus, who was asked what should be done to the woman. Jesus replied, "Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone." Slowly the mob left. Finally, Jesus, who canonically <em>was</em> without sin, didn't throw a stone, and instead sent the woman on her way with the advice, "Go now, and sin no more."
<ul><li> It's present in the Old Testament, as well, most famously with Joseph forgiving his brothers for their past bad treatment of him and selling him into slavery (he points out to them that despite their wicked intentions in doing that, it ended up being a good thing as he became the prime minister of Egypt and was able to save hundreds, including them, from starvation).
</li><li> According to the 10 commandments, the divine forgiveness is at least 500 times greater than the divine wrath (it said in the commandment about idolatry, that God will punish until the fourth generation, if they continue sinning, but will reward thousands (minimum 2000) of generations, if they don't). It also said somewhere in the Talmud (a collection of 63 big books), that the measure of the divine forgiveness towards a person is according to the person's readiness to forgive others.
</li><li> Jesus stated that forgiving others was necessary, otherwise God could not and would not forgive you. This warning was accompanied by a parable where a rich man found that one of his servants owed him around a year's wages. He was about to have the man and his family sold into slavery to pay the debt but when the man begged for time, the rich man forgave the entire debt. Then the servant promptly went out and found a man who owed him a bit under a month's wages and demanded immediate payment. When the third man begged for time to pay, the servant refused and had the third man put in prison. The rich man found out about this and was furious. He summoned the servant, "unforgave" his debt and had the servant put in prison to be tortured until the entire debt was repaid. Fairly clearly an example of the first type.

<ul><li> Reigns, with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>, could never find it in himself to completely hate Rollins. He was deeply disappointed, certainly, and they had a fierce and competitive rivalry over the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but deep down he still saw Rollins as his little brother. So, when circumstances forced them into an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation, it was only a matter of time before he finally let bygones be bygones and forgave Rollins.
</li><li> Ambrose was another matter entirely. Aside from some heat-of-the-moment spontaneous team ups, things remained tense between them for months even after Rollins turned face; it was mitigated by them being on separate shows, only to flare up when Ambrose was traded back to RAW in mid-2017 and circumstances forced <em>them</em> into an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation. Unlike Reigns, Ambrose genuinely did hate Rollins — mainly because Rollins was his closest friend and arguably the person he trusted most. More than once, their closeness was commented on, which is why, when Rollins betrayed the Shield, Ambrose took it far harder than Reigns did. <br/><br/>What followed was a blood feud that lasted the better part of the next three years and caused Rollins to hate Ambrose almost as much as Ambrose hated him, which made things that much harder when Rollins decided he wanted to bury the hatchet. Ambrose, being a naturally suspicious person, initially rejected his attempts at reconciliation, which made Rollins even more desperate and frustrated as he continued to all but <em>beg</em> for it. Eventually, it became clear that, if they were ever going reforge their relationship, it wasn't just Ambrose that had to forgive; Rollins also had to forgive <em>Ambrose</em> for everything that Ambrose did to him (no matter how justified it was). It wasn't long before people realized that words weren't going to cut it, and it was only after Ambrose and Rollins fought out all the anger between them did they finally make up.

Scorpion finds it in himself to forgive Sub-Zero, shakes his hand, and promptly storms off to deal with Quan Chi, who conversely he has <em>no intention of forgiving</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Forgiveness is a theme that is relevant for Presea in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>. She finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Regal</span> was the one who killed her sister Alicia around the same time that she learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alicia turned into a monster and begged Regal to kill her</span>. She decides to continue to fight alongside him in spite of that fact, and her personal trial in Welgaia involves her finally letting go of her resentment toward <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Regal and Altessa, the latter of whom had experimented on her</span>. Fittingly, the villain refuses to let go of the past: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even at the end, Mithos clings to his hatred of humans, declaring that given the chance, he would do the same thing all over again</span>.
<ul><li> Also, there's this spoilertastic moment:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Lloyd</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> I defeated Kratos, the angel, the one who betrayed us. And I forgive Kratos, the hero of the Ancient War, who helped us. That's all.</span>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em> you can choose whether or not to forgive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daud</span>, the man who assassinated the Empress Jessamine while you were helpless to watch <em>and</em> the crime for which you were framed. On a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Low Chaos</a> playthrough he will show remorse and signs of starting to crack under the emotional strain, even commenting that he wants to die so the pain stops. If you choose to engage him, he'll call away his guards, say it's his fight, and actually <em>ask</em> for forgiveness upon defeat (even though he knows it's selfish and he doesn't deserve it). If you <em>do</em> give it to him, both he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">the Outsider</a> will be thoroughly astonished. This is unique in the game. Despite bloodless options always being available (and implicitly encouraged by more deaths leading to bleaker endings), the fate of the targets when they aren't outright assassinated is always horrible - perhaps worse than simple death. This is the one point when Corvo's choice is between bloody revenge and compassionate forgiveness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword</a></em>, in Lucius and Renault's A support, Renault admits to Lucius that he is the one who killed Lucius's father before his very eyes when he was a child, and he falls to his knees in tears and begs Lucius to forgive him. Lucius forgives him.
</li><li> This is crucial to the plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuikodenIV">Suikoden IV</a></em>, since the True Rune of Punishment that attaches itself to the main character Lazlo's hand governs atonement <em>and</em> forgiveness. Lazlo's life goes downhill after his best friend Snowe betrays him early in the game. After gathering 107 of Stars of Destiny, the last Star will appear: Snowe himself, assuming Lazlo hadn't already killed him. By this point, Snowe has been thoroughly humbled by his self-inflicted hardships and is willing to accept whatever punishment Lazlo has in store for him. If Lazlo forgives him, Snowe joins the crew as the final Star. This has several gameplay and storyline benefits: Lazlo and Snowe's "True Friends Attack" one of the best combo attacks in the game is unlocked, the Rune of Punishment gains a powerful damage spell that actually <em>heals</em> Lazlo instead of draining his health like the previous spells, and most significantly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the act of forgiveness shifts the Rune into its Forgiveness phase, meaning it won't kill Lazlo when he uses its full power at the very end of the game.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, Vanille reveals to Sazh that his son's death was indirectly her fault (as she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the foreign threat Dajh was conscripted to fight</span>). Sazh considers killing her (and Vanille says he would be justified in doing so), but ultimately concludes that doing so wouldn't solve anything: it wouldn't make the world any safer or bring Dajh back.

A common premise for entire stories in children's animation is that a character will commit some accidental offense, such as breaking another character's toy, etc. The other character knows that it was an accident, but is still hurt and can't bring himself/herself to forgive. The character that had the accident may do chores or favors to try to get the character that feels wronged to forgive them. The story ends with the character eventually finding it in their heart to forgive the other character. The original problem may or may not be resolved.

</li><li> In "A Canterlot Wedding", Twilight is skeptical about the bride, but can't back it up with solid evidence, which makes everypony else (including her brother and Celestia) unwilling to believe her. Later, Applejack apologizes on the behalf of everypony concerned, to which Twilight replies that she doesn't have a grudge against them.
</li><li> "Amending Fences" brings the concept more center stage, as Moon Dancer is resistant to forgiving Twilight for the latter just up and running off to Ponyville and thus standing her up at the party she was supposed to attend.
</li><li> In "Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the episode turns out to be a manifestation of Luna's guilt over her actions as Nightmare Moon, the Tantabus being a being that Luna created to inflict nightmares on herself.

<ul><li> In "Keystone Motel", after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garnet finds out in the episode before that Pearl tricked her into fusing, Garnet is absolutely and understandably furious with Pearl to the point of barely even acknowledging her when she's in the same room.</span> This results in a secondary conflict between Ruby and Sapphire; Ruby doesn't want to forgive Pearl, but Sapphire, despite being just as mad as Ruby is, knows the situation will eventually be resolved and believes that Ruby should forgive Pearl sooner rather than later. This leads to a massive argument between the two that splits up Garnet for over 12 hours. Ruby and Sapphire only talk it out rationally after seeing how their arguing was negatively impacting Steven, and re-fuse after reconciling. Garnet ends up forgiving Pearl in the last episode of the arc after Pearl finally admits that she feels useless and worthless without someone telling her what to do, and that she wanted to fuse with Garnet so badly because she loved experiencing what it was like to be in a stable, "perfect" relationship. Realizing that she hasn't been addressing the emotional needs of her teammates, Garnet tells Pearl that she needs her to be strong and self-determinant so that, in her own times of weakness, she can have someone to look to for guidance.
</li><li> In "Too Far", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Peridot and Amethyst have started bonding due to Amethyst thinking Peridot is funny. Peridot revels in the attention because she sees Amethyst as the only "real Gem" in the group and the one who should be the team leader, since she's a Quartz. She entertains Amethyst by roasting the other Gems, but ends up hurting Amethyst's feelings when, due to her size, she states that Amethyst incubated in the Kindergarten too long and is, by Homeworld standards, "defective" as a result. Peridot legitimately doesn't understand why Amethyst reacted so negatively to the comment, and feels sad and guilty when Amethyst ignores her. After an incident with a runaway drill head that Peridot saves Amethyst from, Peridot tapes a full apology on her tape recorder and plays it for Amethyst, acknowledging her own wrong-doing and stating that she wants to learn how to interact with her properly. Amethyst gracefully accepts the apology and forgives her, and Peridot states that she feels "big"</span>.
</li><li> "Mindful Education" presents Steven and Connie with the revelation that they need to also forgive <em>themselves</em> in addition to forgiving others. The pair stew over the bad things that they've done to others (and any of their problems in general) and lock those feelings away deep within. Without anyone to talk them through it or by not letting themselves forgive themselves for those incidents, they end up with <em>bad</em> cases of self-loathing.

Despite grounding him and made him go to his room for his actions, Della got a hold of herself and hoped she wasn't too tough on Louie.
