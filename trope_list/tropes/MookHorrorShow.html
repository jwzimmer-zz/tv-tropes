<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chapter 64 clearly shows how utterly powerful the Survey Corps has become. A well-trained, fully equipped squad of 35 black-ops commandos in their element is decimated, outmaneuvered, and outwitted by seven teenagers with obsolete combat gear. The derailing train of thought from the squad leader's point of view says it all.
</li><li> Chapter 81 has one when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Levi <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">shreds</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeke</a> out of his Titan form. Zeke goes from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a> to actually being <em>freaked out</em></span>. Taken to another level in 83 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Levi arrives again, having ripped through a small army of Titans singlehandedly to try and stop Zeke from escaping. Zeke's reaction is to call him a monster and <em>withdraw</em> on the spot</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, Vash the Stampede sometimes plays up the horror factor that his reputation gives him, since it gets him out of fights and he actually has a strict moral code against killing. He's done the sneak-around-and-pick-your-dudes-off thing and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> advance-while-singing-a-terrifying-ditty-about-genocide song: <em>"Total Slaughter, Total Slaughter, I won't leave a single man alive. Ladi-Ladi-Die, Genocide. Ladi-Ladi-dud, an Ocean of Blood. Let's begin the killing time."</em> <strong>It didn't work</strong>, though kicking a rocket fired from an RPG by the terrified mook, AFTER singing that, into the ceiling DID work.
<ul><li> This is most explicitly shown in one episode, where Monev the Gale found out the hard way how scary a genuinely angry Vash can be when Monev gunned down a bunch of innocent civilians. He compared Vash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">Glowing Eyes of Doom</a> to the eyes of the devil himself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, this is usually how battles between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Alucard</a> and the mooks go. Indeed, Alucard seems to do this on purpose because he thinks it's funny.
<ul><li> Case in point: Walking <em>very</em> slowly down a corridor towards an elevator full of mooks despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, or allowing enemies to shoot him up a bit, just to make sure they know they have <em>zero</em> chance of survival when they realize their weapons barely inconvenience him.
</li><li> When Seras <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drinks Pip's blood and becomes a full vampire</span>, her transformation is enough to terrify <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror">every Nazi vampire in the vicinity</a></span></em>, to the point of them being <em>frozen stiff.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, this befalls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> trying to arrest or kill Guts. Even <em>Apostles</em> aren't immune sometimes — as the Black Swordsman, Guts can be easily seen as even <em>worse</em> than the beings he's going after.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Claire Stanfield</span> versus the Lemures and Ladd Russo.
<ul><li> One flashback scene shows Jacuzzi being threatened by Russo's thugs, and true to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Cowardly Lion</a> nature, Jacuzzi ends up pleading with them to leave him alone so his friends won't kill them/pleading with his friends to show some mercy. The thugs, believing Jacuzzi is alone, don't take the hint and are taken out by Jacuzzi's gang, who all sport <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">Glowing Eyes of Doom</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> has this <em>every single time Ken faces common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a></em> due his ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">make them explode</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom">with a single touch</a>.
<ul><li> The greatest example of this is when Ken, madder than hell at Jackal and his gang for what they did to Taki and Toyo, utterly annihilates them, putting everyone involved through a showcase of just how horrifying Hokuto Shinken, an art explicitly designed for <em>assassination</em>, can actually be. The chapters in question bear names like "Rage! To the Depths of Hell!", "Death to Mad Dogs!", and "A Challenge to the Devils!", though the TV series episode featuring Kenshiro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> is a lot more fitting — "I am Death Itself! I'll Chase You to the Ends of Hell!"
</li></ul></li><li> Kazuma of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SCryed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SCryed">s-CRY-ed</a></em> has been pictured like this on at least one occasion — during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kimishima's death</span>, when he tears into a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">ordinary HOLD troops</a>. We get to see his approach from Scheris's viewpoint — an unstoppable monster stalking out of the flames, spreading death and destruction in his wake...
</li><li> There's several instances of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lan Fan has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">She's Back</a> moment in which she shows that she's recovered from the loss of her arm by rescuing Ed and his group from Gluttony by cutting Gluttony to ribbons with the blade attached to her automail. It's an awesome scene, but it's initially shown from the perspective of Gluttony, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">Obliviously Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> who is overwhelmed with pain and fear.
</li><li> Toward the end of the series, Mustang goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against Envy, and despite Envy being one of the most sadistically cruel characters in the series, you actually feel kind of bad for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">it</a>.
</li><li> "Greedling" helps the rebel forces hold back the soldiers loyal to Central Command.

<ul><li> Vegeta is like this to many of Frieza's other Mooks. In particular Cui, Dodoria, and Appule, who was watching him heal in Frieza's ship.
</li><li> And the only reason Trunks didn't achieve this with Frieza's henchmen was because it took him about 3 seconds to kill about 20 of them.

Just watch him plowing though the Red Ribbon Headquarters to get the Dragonballs as proof. He dodged a projectile fired from a rocket launcher literally meters across, then slammed the soldiers into a wall; shrugged off a sniper shot as if it was a pellet from a BB gun, terrifying the sniper; then he kept punching through the ceiling to reach the leader's floor.

</li><li> The original series did it very well, by giving us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Char 'Red Comet' Aznable</a>, so feared that his entering the battle provoked an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment (and would continue doing so for the entire series), attacking the Gundam with everything he had and realizing he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">Shooting Superman</a>. Later Zeon mechas had weapons that could theorically destroy the Gundam, but by that point Amuro's body count justified his nickname of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">White Devil</a>, and in one occasion we were treated to a Zeon force that outnumbered the heroes four to one and outgunned them by six to one being effortlessly destroyed by the Gundam, with the viewers' point of view being the one of the Zeon's commander having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment.

We see a three-second video of the Gundam chopping up a Zaku... from the Zaku's perspective. What with the Gundam's pitiless face, glowing yellow eyes, and the sheer terror in the pilot's voice, it's very obvious why Zeon decided to call it the "White Devil".

</li><li> The first two chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em> featured a couple of these.

</li><li> This usually happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> when a notable character launches a one-man charge on his enemies. A more literal example would be during a flashback on Thriller Bark, at the time of Brook's rampage as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Humming Swordsman</a> five years prior to the story. Hilariously enough, the one doing the scaring is <em>also</em> scared (Having an admitted fear of ghosts) and is only moving with the speed and lightness of a skeleton so he won't have to look at the zombies.
<ul><li> Perhaps one of the biggest examples is Luffy charging into Enies Lobby and spending many chapters just running around and annihilating everything in his path while the Marines panic.
</li><li> Heck, one of the best examples in the series has got to be the Straw Hats vs. the Franky Family, well, it can potentially be called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">a fight</a>. Early in the Water 7 arc, the Franky family steals a sizable amount of money Usopp had been guarding, and proceed to beat him up and mock him when he shows up at their hideout to try and get it back. When Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper learn of this, they immediately head off to said hideout themselves, and kick off their entrance by punching out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> unlucky enough to have been leaving for an errand right when they get to the front door. After that, the four proceed to blow though the Franky Family's best defenses like they weren't even there, swatted aside their best attacks effortlessly, and then systematically block off every one of their escape routes, all the while beating the everliving crap out of them one by one. When one tries to point out that the stolen money isn't with them and beating them up won't solve anything, Luffy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">simply punches him out</a> and informs the remaining members that he couldn't give a rat's ass; all he's interested in is revenge for Usopp. This sequence definitively shows that, as goofy as the Straw Hats are, it is a terrible, <em>terrible</em> idea to make enemies out of them.
</li><li> A more recent anime example in the Punk Hazard arc. Luffy, Zoro, Robin, and Usopp are leaving the "fire" portion of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailfirePeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailfirePeaks">Hailfire Peaks</a> style island, and are crossing a freezing cold, shark infested lake to get to the "hail" side. On the way, Brownbeard and several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> manage to capsize their boat, sending them into the water. After Brook manages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">to distract the group at a critical moment</a>, they then find that Zoro had easily cut apart all of the sharks that were after them, and all four are on a plateau above. They're all half-frozen over and look like death, but they still manage prominent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smiles</a> at the group as they each calmly point out which Mook they're going to steal a set of winter clothes from, freaking said Mooks out to no end. Finally, Brownbeard recognizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Luffy</a>, which is enough to convince everyone to just get the hell out of there, though too late to prevent the winter clothes from getting stolen anyway.
</li><li> How <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward">Usopp</a> beats most of his enemies (the most well known example being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingTheHorror">Perona</a>).
</li><li> Most of the time the Straw Hat Pirates have been in Totto Land has involved Big Mom and her family and crew relentlessly sending combatants, and waves of ordinary goons, at Luffy and his crewmates—whatever she sends out never seems to be enough, and as she and her personal army pursue them out to sea, they only become greater in number and raw strength...and Luffy and the others <em>still</em> pummel them all. You even get the occasional short scene of the Big Mom Pirates' rank-and-file, and citizens of Totto Land, asking just how scared the family must be of the Straw Hats as they see large crowds of Big Mom's fighters mobilize where they anticipate Luffy will go.

Reiji loves to torment and scare his enemies into broken wrecks during his battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ginga turns the tables on him during their fight by exploiting Reiji's own fear of his enemies <em>not</em> being afraid of him, sending him into a fear-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>.</span>

This triggers a trap where they're about to be crushed by exploding zombies, from which they barely escape. And <em>then</em> they run into an elder lich, an undead powerful enough to commands the vast swarms of zombies they fought. Seeing as it isn't attacking, they try to negotiate with it, addressing it as the tomb's master... only to see <em>six more</em> coming up behind them. The team breaks and runs, only to fall into a teleport trap and end up in a room full of cockroaches. The cockroach king is kind enough to tell them that they made it as far as the <em>second</em> floor before sending his minions to eat them alive.

He is effortlessly beaten by a giant hamster, and when he loses his arms, they make no effort to heal him, even kicking his corpse for good measure.

At the tender age of 13 he nearly single-handedly stopped the invasion of Okinawa, using his unique decomposition magic to quite literally erase the enemy soldiers from existence with his right hand, while resurrecting his allies with his left hand. This freaked the enemy out so much, they decided that the only way to salvage the situation would be to bring in the cruisers and bombard the beaches from afar. It didn't help them much. The higher ups even forbid the utterance of that name among the soldiers. Three years later China attacked again in Yokohama on 31 of October 2095, only to be repelled once more, this time also losing almost all of their land forces involved in the attack, a third of their entire fleet and an important naval base at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula. Along with a chunk of land which was obliterated in an event that was later called "The Scorched Halloween".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is fond of doing this. Emphasized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>. Striking fear into criminals is kind of Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">whole shtick</a>, to the point that a yellow ring tried to conscript him into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Sinestro Corps</a>, which is powered by fear. In other words, the ring decided that Batman was the scariest thing in the <em>entire space sector</em>. And the only reason it didn't take was because it detected previous contact with a green ring. Later, during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, a Sinestro Corps ring decided to settle for Scarecrow. Granted, Batman was going on his exodus through time during that event, so the ring wasn't able to try for the Caped Crusader again.
</li><li> It's easy to forget because of his family-friendly portrayals, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> sometimes comes across this way, especially when he intervenes in muggings. Just imagine how you'd react to a gruesomely contorting silhouette with wide, staring eyes scuttling down the wall at you...
<ul><li> In one particular Spider-Man instance, he was fighting a costumed mercenary in a secure medical facility. The mercenary didn't realize that he was out-matched, until Spidey tore a reinforced steel fire door from the wall and threw it at him. <em>Effortlessly.</em> After that, the mercenary was fleeing in terror. Ordinary opponents generally don't realize what the "friendly neighborhood" Spider-Man is capable of.
</li><li> There's another bit where one of his enemies has hired a professional merc team to take Spider-Man out. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap">"chase" him</a> into Central Park and, while the leader is giving a rousing speech about how Spider-Man's rep had to be overblown and that he was just an amateur and to play by the numbers, Spider-Man is taking out each of the other mercs behind the leader one at a time, while they're traveling in a tight formation and looking just about every direction except the one that matters (up). The leader ends his speech to turn around and gauge its impact on his men only to find them all gone... and then he goes berserk. Spider-Man ends up leaving the unconscious mercs webbed up around the house of the enemy who'd hired them. Think it was the Chameleon... he freaked out.

It culminated in Spidey tossing her through a wall and over a cliff <em>casually</em>, and Titania having a phobia about facing the web-slinger that lasted for years.
</li><li> In his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a> has this trope even more strongly. He even threatens to eat your brains! Backfired once, though. Rescuing an innocent girl from perceived danger? Okay, cool. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrifyingRescuer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrifyingRescuer">a giant slime monster with foot long teeth</a> gave the girl horrible nightmares.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletSpider">Kaine a.k.a. the Scarlet Spider</a> epitomises this, being a living demonstration of what a Spider-Man who doesn't play nice looks like.

On his return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland">Spider-Island</a></em>, he's arguably even scarier, since he looks and dresses enough like Spidey that everyone mistakes him for the web-slinger (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">much to his irritation</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">has stingers that emerge from beneath his wrists</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PestController" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PestController">controls spiders.</a> Add all that to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> terror that Spidey sometimes inspires, the fact he can transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">The Other</a> following his second resurrection, that he's prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, has no problem with killing or torture and he's noticeably faster and stronger than Spider-Man and you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">Terror Hero</a> that has drug cartels wetting themselves, the 'Superior' Spider-Man engaging in a massive freak-out and is capable of tearing through the X-Men and (briefly) <em>killing</em> Wolverine.

</li></ul></li><li> "The End" has a very short implied one: Sometime after a global nuclear war is about to start, the guards at Sing-Sing are ordered to execute the prisoners, saving the Punisher for last. As they're about to enter Frank's cell, the bombs hit and the lights go out. Then one of the guards yells at his squadmate to let go of his rifle...
</li><li> "The Cell" has Frank get arrested and sent to Ryker's. From there he instigates a massive riot to cause his real targets (the mobsters indirectly responsible for his family's deaths) to panic and run for an exit... except that at every exit is a sobbing convict telling them to turn back before getting headshotted by Frank. The mobsters flee back to their original cell, wonder why Frank has it in for them personally and are about to turn on each other when Frank comes in.

Even facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerrorHero">the goddamned Batman</a> would be better than to risk testing the patience of a guy who could do that, he decided.

Although, frankly, it's more a horror show for the <em>reader</em>, because Eric Draven and his enemies are equally matched in bloodlust - and the goons Eric slaughters believe him until the very end to be simply a maniac who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie">Not Afraid to Die</a>, so they just keep coming at him, figuring that he'll eventually go down if they hit him enough times.

The most egregious examples come from the ending chapter and a side story: in the ending chapter the Beagle Boys, numbering eight with Granpa Beagle, are running from the Money Bin with some stolen money, only to discover that they're being chased by SCROOGE, causing Granpa Beagle (then the only one to have met him before) to faint in terror before Scrooge effortlessly knocks them out while complaining of old age; in a side story set in Klondike a group of mooks who had already faced him once learns they can steal Scrooge's mining claim if they prevent him from talking with Goldie, decides to beat him up and give him to the Mounties (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>), but upon learning there's only two dozen of them they try and search for some other people.

Probably the most epic example comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a></em>: After having been recaptured by Kimura and tortured, Laura makes her escape by <em>flooding the entire base with the trigger scent</em> via the sprinkler system. Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Kimura</a></em>, who Laura can't even harm to begin with, responded with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> has a few of these under his own belt. One of the most notorious events happened during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga">the Hellfire Club's abduction of Jean Grey/Phoenix</a>. All the other X-Men were either captured or incapacitated; Wolvie's sent down a storm drain in a flood. He washes up in the basement, and proceeds to stealthily go up level by level, since even HE can't fight the whole club at once. "Stealthy", in this case, meaning "gut everyone in the room before they can make noise." He grabs one poor schlub to interrogate him, starts off by giving him an utterly <em>terrifying</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">description of what he and his claws can do</a>, and mentally notes to himself that he's <em>toned down</em> since joining the X-Men, since he actually let this one <em>live long enough to even answer his questions</em>. AFTER, it must be reminded, he just eviscerated a few dozen other guards on the way up. This scene also shows up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">animated series</a> — the series obviously cut out the slaughter but still had Wolverine telling the mook that his adamantium claws could cut through the mook's armor like a hot knife through butter and implying that they could do worse to flesh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> loves this trope. Wallace, Miho, and Marv have all inspired a great deal of dread in their enemies.
<ul><li> When Marv killed the police death-squad goons at the Farm after they had just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blown away his parole officer Lucille</span>, he faced the last one and said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing."</a> The next page showed him chasing the guy down with a hatchet while cackling like a lunatic.
</li><li> Miho had an entire mob family quaking in fear throughout <em>Family Values.</em> She even intimidated one mook into killing his own brother.
</li><li> Wallace had a guild of assassins running scared to the point where the mob boss running the organization decided just to leave him alone and not try to get revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, the scene in Rorschach's backstory in which the kidnapper comes home plays out something like this.
<ul><li> Dr. Manhattan does this in the Vietnam War where he effortlessly vaporizes Vietcong as he rolls.
</li><li> Rorschach actually outdoes Dr. Manhattan in this during the riots. Where as the rioters argued with Dr. Manhattan, the people left immediately when Rorschach just made his presences known to them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>, a small-time crook sees the superhero Jack-in-the-Box change into his civilian clothes. At first he thinks he's struck gold by discovering this potentially valuable information, but then starts to imagine all the ways in which selling the info could go wrong, including nightmares of being pursued by Jack (a light-hearted-yet-potentially-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">scary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Xadhoom</a> is one of the very few people in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Disney comic</a> allowed to break the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> rule... And boy does she take advantage of it every time she meets the Evronians. The series' protagonist Paperinik is no slouch himself. Usually it's masked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, but those who escaped have <em>nightmares</em> about him. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Even the emotionally-crippled Evronians</a></em> (upon seeing him on their freakin' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">mobile homeworld</a></em>, one of them who had a previous run-in with Paperinik <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">started trying to convince himself it was another nightmare</a>). And <em>then</em>, in the reboot series, we once enjoyed Paperinik getting <em>really</em> pissed, and it was downright scary. Oh, did we mention that Paperinik is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> identity assumed in some Italian stories by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a></em>?
<ul><li> In 'classic' Paperinik stories this seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Paperinik and most crooks have an amiable chat when the latter are caught in the act before the criminals go to give themselves up to the police</a>, but whenever the Beagle Boys or someone new commit a crime the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> becomes clear: Paperinik <em>will</em> defeat them anyway (and in a few occasions has beaten up and caught <em>hundreds of criminals at once</em>) and isn't shy to repeat the performance with criminals from out of town or the Beagle Boys (who are simply too stubborn to know when to quit), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">so the other criminals choose a way that allows them to dodge at least the beating</a>.
</li><li> Paperinik is also prone to do this <em>literally</em>. As in going at the homes of criminals from out of town who plan to come in his city, show them a video of what he did to criminals stupid enough to commit crimes in Duckburg, and ask them if they really want to come to Duckburg. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainKnowsWhereYouLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainKnowsWhereYouLive">The fact a sadistic superhero just proved he knows where they live</a> only amps up the terror factor.
</li><li> In comic books Donald can do it even without dressing as Paperinik, as shown in "Donald and Reginella's Wedding". Just the sight early in the story of Donald starting loading plenty of salt shells for his <em>shotgun</em> should be enough to warn the reader shit would go down, let alone him furiously shouting threats at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> while wielding it (and after having <em>shot him in the ass <strong>twice</strong></em>)... And indeed, the first encounter was so bad that the villains then come at him with <em>an entire army</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">It wasn't enough</a>, and afterward Donald can dictate rather harsh terms on pain of him finishing the job-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">without killing them</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a> does this as his shtick in most incarnations. Unlike many comic book supers, he is perfectly willing to kill and often does, and usually has the reality warping powers to make the event horrific and terrifying for the evil-doers.
</li><li> Whenever any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a> loses control on his Spirit of Vengeance, expect this trope to be played in full force. Johnny and Danny have theirs on tighter leashes, so it's rarer for them. Robbie has less control and so far all we see of him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewGhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewGhostRider">All-New Ghost Rider</a> feels like watching a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> except every victim is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">a criminal</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD">2000 AD</a></em> series <em>Jaegir</em> is set in the universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper">Rogue Trooper</a></em>. Jaegir was once a soldier stationed on Nu Earth, and she remembers Rogue as, in her own words, a "blue demon" who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV">tore through her comrades</a>, ripping their throats out, while his allies' ghosts laughed and joked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, you wouldn't think that a sweet little girl who talks to plants could be all that terrifying, but Klara once <em>accidentally</em> tore apart a squad of paramilitary goons, and managed to catch the son of <em>Wolverine</em> unawares. A mock psych-profile released in advance of the team's guest appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy">Avengers Academy</a></em> suggested that the Marvel Universe at large sees her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> and prefers to give her a wide berth.

It has a section from the point of view of a nameless HYDRA paratrooper who, like about twenty of his colleagues, is wearing a derivative of the Falcon suit.

</li><li> At the end of the remake of <em>Bangkok Dangerous</em> Joo stalks and efficiently kills many gangsters as they grow increasingly jumpy and frantic.
</li><li> The opening scene of Tim Burton's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> qualifies — but then the trope is inverted in the movie's cathedral climax, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> <em>inviting</em> Batman ("Shall we dance?") to tangle with his stealthy, <em>gongfu</em>-trained assassins. What makes the scenario especially ironic is that Batman has just survived being <em>blown up</em> and is already bleeding and at least partially physically weakened; he does manage to dispatch all three of the mooks — indeed, killing all but one of them! — but it isn't easy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, some of Batman's first attacks on criminals are filmed this way. Not to mention their POV of him gliding over the city while they are under the effects of the Fear Toxin. Plus the scene of him interrogating Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. Scarecrow, who at the moment was being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>.

First, they find the slaves who Batman saved from a human trafficker, refusing to leave their cell because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero">thing</a> that saved them is still in the building. Then the cops hear the sounds of a fight and the human trafficker's terrified scream. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">rookie cop</a>, Officer Rucka, finds the human trafficker handcuffed to a radiator, badly beaten and branded with a Bat symbol. Rucka, already freaking out, suddenly realises that Batman is right behind him, causing him to panic and fire wildly at the Bat while Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl">quickly crawls across the ceiling</a> in a <em>very</em> creepy way and disappears.
<ul><li> Whilst his later rescue of Martha Kent in the warehouse is more action heavy, it still manages to weave in this aspect. The mercenaries prepare for Batman, guns trained squarely on the door where they <em>think</em> he'll make his entrance, only for Batman to explode up from underneath the floor, pulling at least one guy down through it and start swiftly picking them off. Anatoli, secure in the room holding Martha, quite visibly begins freaking out at hearing the gunfire and screams coming from outside, realising that his men (whom number close to two dozen) are <em>not</em> stopping Batman.

Unlike in the comic, here Eric doesn't actually want to kill anyone except for Skank, one of his fiancée's rapists (all of whom were acting on Top Dollar's orders, but Eric doesn't know this yet) - and was willing to let everyone else live, including Top Dollar and his half-sister, if they would just hand Skank over to him. But Top Dollar's extreme arrogance drives him to immediately order Eric's execution - and the inevitable result is what looks like two dozen henchmen being slaughtered either by gunfire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">Top Dollar's stash of antique weapons</a>, or simply being thrown out the window.

Many Mooks and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> start panicking once the bodies pile up.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> films rarely go here due to the necessity of keeping Bond a positive character. There have been exceptions:
<ul><li> After Bond sends a mook on skis careening over a cliff in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em>, the camera stays on the mook as he takes his long, final, fall to his death.

It's mentioned that the hallmark of an attack by a higher end combat GI is when your friends are all shooting and the next moment they're all dead. The greatest example of this is probably in book five, <em>Operation Shield</em>. Cassandra had befriended a trio of war orphans in the previous novel, and the League government decided that kidnapping the two oldest ones would be a great way to blackmail her. She had a reputation as a cool thinker, so they expected that she'd easily cave to their demands to keep the kids safe.

<div class="indent"><strong>Murphy:</strong> Watching Dresden operate was usually one of two things: mildly amusing or positively terrifying. On a scene, his whole personal manner always made me think of autistic kids. He never met anyone's eyes for more than a flickering second. He moved with the sort of exaggerated caution of someone who was several sizes larger than normal, keeping his hands and arms in close to his body. He spoke a little bit softly, as if apologizing for the resonant baritone of his voice. <br/>But when something caught his attention, he changed. His dark, intelligent eyes would glitter, and his gaze became something so intense it could start a fire. During the situations that changed from investigation to desperate struggle, his whole being shifted in the same way. His stance widened, becoming more aggressive and confident, and his voice rose up to become a ringing trumpet that could have been clearly heard from opposite ends of a football stadium. <br/>Quirky nerd, gone. Terrifying icon, present. <br/>Not many "vanillas", as he called nominally normal humans, had seen Dresden standing his ground in the fullness of his power. If we had, more of us would have taken him seriously — but I had decided that for his sake, if nothing else, it was a good thing that his full capabilities went unrecognized. Dresden's power would have scared the hell out of most people, just like it had scared me. <br/>It wasn't the kind of fear that makes you scream and run. That's fairly mild, as fear goes. That's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a> fear. No. Seeing Dresden in action filled you with the fear that you had just become a casualty of evolution — that you were watching something far larger and infinitely more dangerous than yourself, and that your only chance of survival was to kill it, immediately, before you were crushed beneath a power greater than you would ever know.

As the fights wear on, the mooks get more and more terrified (you can even check their elevated heart rates via Detective Vision) and start behaving more erratically. And to make matters worse, their boss is often there to berate them via loudspeaker for their failure (Joker being the worst of the lot since, as seen by the page quote, he actually seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">ENJOY</a> pointing out how utterly screwed his men are).

He doesn't angrily berate his men for their incompetence. He doesn't gleefully taunt them about how screwed they are. Instead, he gives them a <em>very</em> detailed and "educational" lecture about the exact psychological nature of the fear they are currently experiencing, and how it will haunt them for years to come and perhaps the rest of their lives. No wonder he was only allowed to do this once in the entire game. All other times you are in a Predator section against militamen, it's the Arkham Knight himself on the radio. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or Deathstroke, after the Knight is defeated.</span>

While chopping Orcs to bits is enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Talion</a> can use the surrounding environment to terrorize them. Like unleashing Morgai flies or Caragors on them.

When you max out their fear meter, Batman automatically steps out into the open as you see, from the mook's POV, a terrifying glowy-eyed demonic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Bat Man</a>.
</li><li> Some trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">its sequel</a> have featured this:
<ul><li> For the first game, we have the Warriors of Chaos and Vampire Counts trailers.
<ul><li> The first is shown from the perspective of an Empire soldier who's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of a battle with Chaos as he haplessly struggles to get away from an offscreen enemy while flashing back to the horrifying warriors charging into battle and chopping up his allies. Then at its apex, the trailer closes on him about to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">hammered into the ground</a> by Kholek Suneater.
</li><li> The second shows a Witch Hunter and his underlings being ambushed by the Undead, lead by Mannfred von Carstein. While haunting music swells, the scenes of Vampire armies besieging human and Dwarf cities is intercut with the Witch Hunter fighting for his life while Mannfred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousWalk">slowly advances on him</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">cutting down soldiers right and left</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffhandBackhand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffhandBackhand">without even looking at them</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The Dark Elves trailer for the second game features a near-direct homage to Vader's scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Malekith</a> confronting and cutting down some steadily panicking High Elven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">red shirts</a> using his sword and magic powers in similar fashion.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> gets like this by the end. There's nothing like tearing through a building of guards and hearing their boss respond to their messages over the PA, "What do you <em>mean</em>, 'he's unstoppable'?"
<ul><li> This happens in parts of <em>2</em> with Mona as the killer.
</li><li> At one point in <em>3</em> at the tail end of tearing through a base full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>, one of them drops his gun, drops to his knees and begs for mercy. There's also a minor mook-on-mook variation when Max lets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Serrano</span> loose on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the doctor</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting point to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a> 4</em> switching away from Dante's perspective from the first half lets the player see the beloved hero as presumably everyone else does; a cocky, stylish, unstoppable <em>killing machine</em> that does not consider you a threat in any way and is wholly justified in doing so. Dante proving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, far and away more dangerous than anything else Nero goes up against, lets the player see what it's like being on the <em>receiving</em> end of Dante's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowyInvincibleHero">Showy Invincible Hero</a> shenanigans.
<ul><li> The opening cutscene really serves to sell this. A mysterious man in a red coat smashes through the ceiling, murders your leader, and then assaults an army of trained swordsmen and slaughters the lot of them. He barely speaks, and when he does, it's only to mock you. When you shoot at him, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">shoots your bullets out of the air</a>. And this is the guy you played as in the last few games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> has two separate instances where Ezio's main targets, Templars, are heard talking about Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The first man is completely paranoid, trying to talk himself into calming down ("He'll... he'll leave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">He'll get bored, I'm sure...</a>") and surrounding himself with guards. The second has a near-panic attack when he finds out that Ezio is simply <em>in the same city</em> that he is.
<ul><li> While Ezio had yet to establish his reputation as a supernatural combatant, both targets had actually been in Ezio's presence — the first had been one of the would-be killers of the Medici brothers, the second when Ezio trailed a conspirator to a secret meeting only to be revealed and escape — so they knew already how close he had come to them before; in the time between the targets he'd also developed a reputation as <em>the</em> Assassin.
</li><li> In both the first game and the second, guards will throw down their weapons and <em>flee</em> in absolute terror after watching Altaïr or Ezio tear apart their comrades without so much as being scratched in return.
</li><li> In the case of the second target, it is all the more satisfying, considering you're sitting on the ledge <em>right above him</em>.
</li><li> Or, in the case of the first, the game encourages you to hide inside the well he's currently pacing around.
</li><li> A commonly heard reaction to seeing Connor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">the third game</a> is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Hell.</a> We're gonna' need some help!" Said Redcoats could end up torn to pieces in seconds. It is also entirely possible to leave a few bodies hanging from the branches of trees in your wake, or thin their numbers by luring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">bear</a> to them.
</li></ul></li><li> Enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> often scream and run away when they see you coming. They do this automatically if you use a continue.
<ul><li> The first game pulls this off on the player in the ending: A surviving enemy tosses a paper airplane, and the view follows it as it flies through the game's stages... littered with the bodies of the scores of soldiers you've slaughtered over the course of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a> II</em> shows the chained-up Starkiller about to be executed by Imperial stormtroopers. He uses the Force to free himself and knock out the lights. The guards start looking around, shooting at any shadow in near-total darkness, while Starkiller picks them off one-by-one. The last guard starts backing off towards the door, his every shot deflected, until Starkiller impales him with his lightsabers.
<ul><li> In both installments of this series, it probably isn't a fun prospect being a Stormtrooper ordered to take out a renegade Sith.
</li></ul></li><li> In the promotional materials for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em>, it tells of a previous mission to Tatooine where Kyle Katarn left a single survivor. The author of the message, a New Republic intelligence agent, expresses anger that said sole survivor was too traumatized to offer an vital information.
</li><li> In the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> game, if you blew your cover in the U-Boat mission, Kriegsmarine officers would yell, "It's Jimmy Patterson!" and attempt to mow you down in a panic.
</li><li> A simple but nonetheless notable game feature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>. Sometimes an assassin's strike from a stalker will "terrify" enemies nearby, stopping them from fleeing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowComplex">Shadow Complex</a></em>, definitely. You are just this one random guy who is going through the base and slowly taking it out. Many of the guards at first are like "it's just one guy" but later on they realize how much damage he's doing. And then there's the ways to kill enemies - normally, sneak fisticuffs, headshots, grenades, missiles, ground pounds, environmental factors... all while you slowly advance from civilian to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> badass.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Grunts</a> will say things like "He's everywhere!" and run away when you kill a lot of them at once. The books also go into their point of view every so often, and they tend to be exactly that scared (if not more so). Additionally, Covenant troops often are heard referring to the Master Chief and his fellow Spartans as "demons", both in and out of the games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a></em>, Area 12's baddies go into a panic when they spot SuperJoe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a></em> sometimes requires this if the player wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. Shoot ten out of twelve gang members who hang out at the gas station? The last two frantically run away. Many times Tony ends up mowing them down as they are trying to hijack a car and flee.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> DLC <em>Arrival</em>, the Project guards pretty much start panicking the second Shepard wakes up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">then starts slaughtering his/her way through the entire complex</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">by him/herself</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Scientist:</strong> Readings indicate that Shepard is resisting the sedatives. Must be a glitch in the system...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh shit</a>! It's not a glitch. SECURITY!
</div><ul><li> Even before that, during the Korlus mission, you tap into the Blue Suns' radio early on, letting you listen to their increasing panic as you slaughter your way through their base.
</li><li> Any mission that involves the Eclipse or Blue Suns mercs tends to have com chatter from their bosses getting more and more freaked out as Shepard and co. effortlessly end everyone in their way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">The Blood Pack on the other hand...</a>
</li><li> There's also strong indication that this is how the Omega mercenaries viewed Archangel. Of the three gang leaders, only Garm (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> Krogan in charge of the Blood Pack) isn't freaked out by how close Archangel has come to killing him. The other two are really pissed and afraid by his attempts on their lives, not to mention desperate enough to team up.
</li><li> Also during <em>Arrival</em>, during the fight for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Object Rho</a>, particularly notable if you're going for the "Last Stand" achievement.

Notably, they're <em>just as terrified</em> when he's getting around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun">totally unseen</a>. It's made very clear that it's still an example to them, because Adam is a heavily-augmented super-soldier who, upon being forcibly woken from cryo-sleep, managed to kill five armed soldiers single-handedly after being surrounded and it still took <em>eight more soldiers</em> to bring him down. Now he's loose in the complex, he has all his gear back, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">they don't know where he is</a></em>. Hell, even if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">keep a low body count</a>, the soldiers will remark that that just means Jensen is "more resourceful and more <em>dangerous</em>".

The mix of shock and terror in the grunt's voice after his squad gets wiped out can catch you off guard, and if you corner them with your Titan, they sometimes drop their weapons or go into the fetal position.

He begins the game as a rookie who is barely able to take out a small enemy cruiser. After a few weapon upgrades and some player experience, he can (and if you want all the achievements, will) be the most effective weapon on his side, tearing through enemy fleets and having entire fighter squadrons directed his way, with most of the enemy ace squadrons either dead or resigned to not being able to touch him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs">Sleeping Dogs</a></em>, Wei Shen can cause any enemies around him in a fist fight to flinch by grabbing one of their friends and breaking their leg with a stomp to the side of the knee. He can also use the environment to do things like set mooks on fire, impale them on hooks or electrocute them. Typically, the drug bust side missions involve beating down a certain number of guards to hack surveillance devices and end when any remaining guards run for their lives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarkOfTheNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarkOfTheNinja">Mark of the Ninja</a></em>, this actually works as a gameplay mechanic. Usually, when a guard comes across a dead body, or sees you attack one of his fellows, he sounds the alarm. However, certain particularly brutal kills (such as hanging guards with the chain you use as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">Grappling-Hook Pistol</a>, hitting them with a portable spike trap or feeding them to flesh-eating bugs) causes an enemy to enter a terrified state where they can't sound the alert, just scream helplessly and fire blindly, often mowing down other enemies. If you're feeling particularly cruel, you can also accomplish this by dropping a corpse in front of a guard below, who will get scared <em>absolutely</em> shitless by the sight of his dead buddy plummeting on the floor in front of his very eyes. More generally, you are a blade-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert">Stealth Expert</a> sneaking about casually dismembering the mooks in horrible fashion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the target you spend the first half of the game hunting down is eventually reduced to cowering in a heavily secured panic room and pleading for his life as you cut down his guards and disable his automated defenses.</span>. Really, it's Mook Horror Show: The Game.
<ul><li> It gets even easier if you use the Path of Nightmares outfit, which makes guards terrified by seeing <em>any</em> dead body (or even unconscious dogs.)

Using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> power to get behind an enemy makes them wonder "where'd he go?", and then you can strangle them unconscious, slit their throat, shoot them in the back, or feed them to a swarm of rats, and if you're good enough at sneaking about, you can do all that without them seeing much more than your terrifying visage and their life flashing before their eyes. That skull mask he's wearing is enough to reduce most bystanders to tears. And that's not even mentioning that you can use severed body parts as thrown weapons.
<ul><li> The idle chatter that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">assassins</a> have make it absolutely clear they're scared by how skillful Corvo is.

Oh, sure, enemies might start to charge at you when a mission starts, but watch closely and you'll notice that the longer a mission runs, the more enemy soldiers flee at your mere presence, firing over their shoulder in their retreat. In fairness, a single Tenno can effortlessly infiltrate and slaughter an outpost or ship with over 150 personnel, performing feats such as aerial acrobatics, turning invisible, elemental summoning, resurrecting the dead, or defying death itself. On top of that, most Warframes have access to some kind of ability that allows them to simply destroy all opposition in a radius of up to 20 meters. Now consider that most Tenno operate in teams of four. No wonder Grineer and Corpus troops start panicking and fleeing at the sight of one. Notably, this fear response does not appear in robots or infested enemies, but it <em>does</em> show up in the Corrupted, implying that even total brainwashing wasn't enough to keep these soldiers from realizing they should be shitting themselves in fear and running at the sight of a Tenno.

</li><li> The best in-episode example is in "The Trial". Batman is loose and the villains are in a dark room lit only by Two-Face's lighter. Batman, in the exact environment where he is next to invincible, circles around the edges of the room, outside the lighter's glow, and grabs the villains one by one. The Joker finally says it's time to panic when he sees Harley suspended from the ceiling and bound with the straitjacket Batman had just escaped from. To make things worse, Harley <em>had</em> been holding onto Batman's utility belt...
</li><li> Another good example is at the climax of "The Forgotten", which has Batman taking down some evil gold miners who have been enslaving homeless people. In a startling aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDarkness">Hollywood Darkness</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> has the miners switch off <em>all</em> the lights in the mine and turn on their head-lamps as the only source of illumination, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">not realizing that Batman</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">loves</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">the dark</a>.

</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em>, "Coop D'Etat", an army of giant robots follow Megas into a large cloud and are picked off one by one. One of the robots even trembles in fear.
</li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> episodes were told through the eyes of sympathetic characters attempting to kill Jack. Jack is just as unstoppable in those episodes as any others.
<ul><li> At the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveEpisodePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveEpisodePilot">Three Episode Pilot</a>, Jack has single-handedly decimated a horde of insectoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, ending with one of the robots surrounding him taking a single step <em>away</em> from the samurai covered in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicBlood">Symbolic Blood</a> of his enemies. "No. There <em>is</em> no escape." Violent action ensues.
</li><li> Gets played for laughs in Season Five. Aku has spent the past <em>fifty years</em> throwing <em>everything he has</em> at Jack and watching everything he has <em>fail miserably</em>, and plus Jack has <em>stopped aging</em> so he can't even just hide and wait for Jack to naturally die. The possibility of Jack eventually finding and killing him has been hanging over his head all this time, and it's driven him to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">Nervous Wreck</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Little does he know, Jack has lost his sword and so can't kill him.</span>

Despite how hilariously hammy his dialogue is, you can still see the fear in Shocker's eyes as Spidey is literally hunting him down with the intention of killing him.
