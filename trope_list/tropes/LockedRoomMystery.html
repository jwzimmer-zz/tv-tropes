The standard example being that of a murder victim found in a room with only a single door, securely locked from the inside. Can be the basis for a single plot, or an entire show. A well-designed Locked Room Mystery provides pleasure from trying to figure out the puzzle before it is revealed, from moments of dawning realisation, and from a satisfyingly logical solution. A poorly designed Locked Room Mystery only provides a feeling of having been cheated. Contrary to the name, Locked Room Mysteries don't necessarily have to be murders or take place in locked rooms, just to be crimes that seem to be impossible at first glance (e.g. contemplating how it's possible for someone to travel from one part of the island to another within minutes). The question of <em>who</em> is rarely as interesting in this kind of plot as <em>how</em>.

It is noteworthy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s short story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurdersInTheRueMorgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurdersInTheRueMorgue">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a></em>, widely considered to be the first detective story, involves a Locked Room Mystery.
</p><p>Appears on television in a number of forms. The relatively pure form as a sub-genre of crime television (e.g., <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em>) where the puzzle is eventually unraveled by an eccentric protagonist using subtle clues and pure reason.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em> starts off in classic style, with the old lady shot through the eye in her locked room. Although it's a fairly simple mystery, this serves as a springboard for a whole <em>ship-ton</em> of intrigue in the next episode.
</li><li> Although it is not a crime show, the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Spiral">Spiral</a></em> has a number of locked room mysteries that the protagonist must solve, including one literal locked room murder.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> two-part episode "Remote Island Syndrome" (and the corresponding chapter in one of the light novels) has an example of this inside a locked room on an island hit by a terrible storm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> frequently uses these, though it also plays with this trope, as Conan solves a case when he realizes that a man died <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the moment his wife checked on him (he was drugged into sleep until then)</span>, but the rest of the room was set up to make it look like a locked room mystery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em> features one in majority of the stories.
</li><li> Commonplace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em>. The solution generally involves some manner of sealing the room from the inside in some way that can be performed while outside the room or committing the crime from outside the room. One example is in a case when two idol siblings were suffocated, one to death while another one in critical condition in a small room with no way in or out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their rooms were covered by a gigantic advertisement rubber balloon which could fit the whole room.</span> The reason the second victim survived was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she didn't turn off her room's light before sleeping (she was terrified of ghosts <em>and</em> drowsy after taking allergy meds), burning the rubber from its heat; Kyuu and Sakurako noticed the smell, found the almost dead girl and managed to save her</span>. An example of the second was a man who was found dead in his home with the only door - which opened in - being blocked by a slab of concrete. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The killer used a hose to pump the concrete into a mold from a window. The method of death involved fire, which destroyed the mold after the cement set.</span>
</li><li> One of these came up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out to be a prank by the Queen and Ciel playing Chessmaster to deal with a target of his</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Golgo13">Golgo 13</a></em>, "The Serizawa Family Murders". Two witnesses (brother and sister) to an old murder agree to a meeting in a hotel room guarded — but <em>not</em> under surveillance — by the police. They go in, but when the police storm the room after several hours, only the brother is in the room, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">denying that he ever saw his sister that evening</a>. Despite being the prime suspect, they have to release him because they never find even a trace of the sister's body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Down the toilet, one by one." The sister fatally wounded herself and told her brother — the murderer in the old case — how to systematically butcher her body to hide the evidence, if he didn't want to confess.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Domu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Domu">Domu</a></em>, where the detectives have to investigate a series of suicides at one apartment complex. One man jumps off the roof to his death, despite the lock of the door to get onto the roof being rusted shut for years on end. The younger policeman points out how ridiculous this "sort of... locked <em>roof</em> mystery, right?" is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Too bad science can't explain it.</span>
</li><li> One of these pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em> to a group of former patients of Fran, with Okita specifically calling it by the trope name. The solution is a lot squickier than some of the other answers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The patients did it to themselves because they get off on Fran operating on them.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> manga, "Turnabout Showtime" is referred to as "the world's smallest locked-room murder", when Flip Chambers is somehow fatally stabbed inside his Sparklestar costume, which cannot hold anything in its hands and is impossible to open by the wearer (although it comes to light that there are workarounds for that, such as catching the zipper on a piece of wire, or wearing the costume backwards).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> short story "Murder Case in the Area" is a form of locked room mystery involving players in an MMO where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a> being PKed inside a town, where game mechanics make it impossible to be attacked or injured. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that they're actually faked suicides, with players stabbing themselves with weak weapons, then pretending to be attacked after some time and teleporting out to simulate game deaths. These players thus succeed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a> a former member of their group into confessing to the murder of a fourth.</span>
</li><li> The 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> show has an episode where notorious gangster Skunk Kusai is suspected of several bank heists where the vaults were tunneled into but examination reveals the holes to have been dug from inside the vaults and the doors were never tampered with. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had kidnapped the inventor of a powerful electromagnetic device and used it to rearrange all the gold in the vault into the shape of a giant robot centipede, making the loot dig <em>itself</em> out and deliver itself to him</span>.
</li><li> One of the Detective Cilan episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. Despite the door being locked and the outside being guarded by a Watchog, and the jewel under lock and key, the power goes off and the Liepard's Eye is stolen. Several clues point to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a>, but Cilan eventually covers the truth: the man Ash battled in the tournament earlier in the episode purposely used an Electric type in their match to short circuit the power to cause a distraction, and had his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Vanillite</a> sneak into the room through a vent, make a key out of ice, and steal the jewel. The perp's role in the tournament would also serve as an alibi, since he'd be too busy battling Ash to steal the gem.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RokkaBravesOfTheSixFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RokkaBravesOfTheSixFlowers">Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers</a></em>, the main cast is within a forest when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">they become trapped there by a magical barrier covering the area</a>, which is activated from an initially sealed room in the forest. The barrier goes up shortly after the seal is broken by the main character, and he then enters to find the room empty and the activation key already in place.
</li><li> A multi-episode arc seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka">Hyouka</a></em>, the Classic Lit club is called upon to help find a conclusion to a student film made with this plot due to the film's writer having to bow out of the project due to illness.

Unfortunately, it's poorly executed much of the time; if it seems the crime could only have been committed by a thief who could turn invisible, it's likely that's exactly what they did somehow, using a gadget or magic spell. However, there <em>do</em> exist some decent stories that feature an actual mystery of this sort as well.
</li><li> A staple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMazeAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMazeAgency">The Maze Agency</a></em> comic book series.
</li><li> The central case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Bookhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Bookhunter">Bookhunter</a></em> involves three concentric locked room mysteries: The thief entered a locked library, removed a book from a locked safe, and carried the book out past the alarm checkpoints—leaving so little evidence that the theft wasn't noticed until weeks later.
</li><li> There's one featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> #700, where the significantly aged corpse of Carter Nichols is found dead in his basement. Batman and Robin are unable to solve the case, but it is later shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the present Carter Nichols went forward in time and killed his future self, causing his dead future self to return to the present. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">bit confusing</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinKingOttokarsSceptre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinKingOttokarsSceptre">Tintin: King Ottokar's Sceptre</a></em> features a non-murder version of this; the sceptre of the King of Syldavia, regarded by the country as symbolic of the king's right to rule, has vanished from a room that was locked from the inside, with all four people inside having been rendered unconscious for a short time by a gas bomb planted inside a camera, bars on all windows, and no way for an accomplice to have just retrieved the sceptre if someone simply dropped it out of the window as the castle is surrounded by a moat and the loyalty of all guards in that area is without question. Tintin eventually deduces that the camera held a small spring-gun that was used to fire the sceptre out through the bars and into a forest on the other side of the moat.
</li><li> A murder committed in a locked room would have been part of the plot in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s never-written <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructionCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructionCrossover">Deconstruction Crossover</a>, <em>The Twilight Of The Superheroes</em>.

A priestess vanishes entirely from a locked and guarded compound. The room she vanishes from? Covered in blood. But there's no blood trail leading out, and no one in the compound saw what happened to her...
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NickVelvet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NickVelvet">Nick Velvet</a></em> short story "The Theft of the Overdue Library Book", Nick has to work out how Sandra Paris abducted someone from a men's room that had an angry guard dog outside its only exit.
</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatMerlini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatMerlini">The Great Merlini</a>'s cases were some form of "impossible crime", with actual locked rooms common as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose">The Name of the Rose</a></em>. The first death involves a defenestration beneath a window that cannot be opened, leaving the monks to suspect supernatural evil is at work. Brother William easily proves the man was a suicide who jumped from a nearby tower and his body rolled to its final resting place. Unfortunately this death is quickly followed by others.
</li><li> A non-murder example in in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLeiber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLeiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s sci-fi novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBigTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBigTime">The Big Time</a></em>; the trope is referred to practically by name, as chapter 9 is titled "A Locked Room" and includes a quote from the detective story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePurloinedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePurloinedLetter">The Purloined Letter</a></em>. The mystery involves the disappearance of a device which maintains the life support within an inescapable hyperdimensional location; it must be inside, seeing as everyone are still alive and there was no possible way to remove it from the area, yet it's nowhere to be found, even when the place is searched top to bottom.
</li><li> Author <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BaynardKendrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BaynardKendrick">Baynard Kendrick</a> (first president of the Mystery Writers of America) wrote a series of novels about blind detective Duncan Maclain. Most of the murders were clever impossible murders — a man stabbed in front of dozens of witnesses during a nightclub show, a man driven down a mountain road to his death while the murderer was miles away, and the like. The true locked room murder was a writer shot at his desk on a large balcony outside his Manhattan apartment while there was no one nearby. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The gun was planted in a bush under which his dog liked to hide. When the church bells went off across the street, the dog dove for cover, triggering the gun.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> episode guide includes "The Riddle of Castle Cain", a competition in the form of a locked room mystery in which the reader is given the same clues as Jonathan to deduce how a very overweight film director could be killed in his viewing room, when someone immediately looked through the projection window and saw no-one there, and he fell against the door making it impossible to open more than a crack. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was killed by his "waif-like" six-year-old stepdaughter. who hid behind a speaker and was later able to slip through the crack in the door.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> The award for all-time nastiness in a locked-room mystery has to go to <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204234335/http://www.violetbooks.com/bowen.html">Marjorie Bowen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s "Scoured Silk".

Elisa, terrified, calls off the wedding. The next morning, Orford is found in the locked cabinet with a steak knife in his back. Fascinated despite herself, Elisa returns with her cousin and investigates, discovering a portion of the silk dress now caught in the panel behind the desk. It is a secret door. Three guesses what was in there and the first two don't count.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> uses a "stranded on the island" variant of this trope: the ten people invited to the island were all trapped there by a storm and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims">killed off one by one</a>. The police can't figure out who the killer could have been because there's irrefutable evidence that none of the last four surviving victims could have been the killer. The solution turns out to be that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the killer faked their own death and later committed suicide in a way that would match up with the other people's written accounts of when they died</span>.
</li><li> Most of French mystery author <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulHalter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulHalter">Paul Halter</a>'s works fall into this category. For example in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourthDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourthDoor">The Fourth Door</a></em> a man enters a supposedly haunted attic room. The door is sealed from the outside with a ribbon and wax, and the wax is imprinted with a rare coin chosen at random. When the cast enter the room later, still sealed from the outside, they discover a different man lying stabbed to death.
</li><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethPeters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethPeters">Elizabeth Peters</a>'s "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLockedTombMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLockedTombMystery">The Locked Tomb Mystery</a>", an ancient Egyptian reports that his family's crypt has been desecrated and robbed a year after his mother's lavish burial. A search reveals no evident means of egress, and the door's seal was unbroken when he and a friend came to check on the tomb. The sleuth who investigates the crime concludes that the woman's son had left a linen wrap on the tomb floor as a "mummy" during the funeral, then later brought his very nearsighted companion along to glimpse it lying there. While his friend was fetching the police, he robbed the tomb himself.
</li><li> The trope is lampshaded in two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em> stories featuring UN investigator Gil Hamilton; "ARM" and "The Patchwork Girl", though the latter story inverts the trope — the 'room' is a lunar city, and the suspect is the only person who was known to be outside on the Moon's surface at the time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> wrote the stories to show that you could use this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a>.

"The Problem of the Grip of Death" is an excellent straight example where the victim is found strangled in his locked apartment, with the windows latched and the door not only locked, but barred in such a way that the bar could not have been dropped from the outside. The solution ultimately involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a boa constrictor acting as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin">Animal Assassin</a></span>.

<ul><li> D.I. Richard Poole faces one of these in the very first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise">Death in Paradise</a></em>. The solution was that it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">technically a subversion: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the victim didn't die until after the room was unlocked</a>, and the witness was lying because she was the killer.</span>
<ul><li> And his successor D.I. Humphrey Goodman solves one of these in the final episode of series 3.
</li><li> And again in "Hidden Secrets" in series 4. A surf instructor is shot inside a shed. The murder weapon is missing, the only door is locked and the wet sand outside the only window is completely undisturbed. In that case the killer ironically <em>meant</em> for it to not be a locked room mystery, but didn't quite get all the details indicating it wasn't a robbery gone wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The victim committed suicide<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2x1o4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2x1o4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2x1o4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the criminal of the week was his doctor who'd falsely led the victim to think he had an incurable degenerative disease, providing supposedly palliative medicine that provoked the symptoms</span>, but tried to make it look like it wasn't one so the insurance would be paid out.</span>
</li><li> <em>The Impossible Murder</em> in series 6 uses a metaphorical locked room — the room wasn't <em>locked</em>, but the only ways the murderer could have gotten to the room can be excluded (the room was on the second floor, with the only stairs in Humphrey's field of view and thus him leaving able to vouch no one went up or down after the victim when the murder must have taken place, and while it would have been <em>possible</em> to climb up to or down from the window, it would have left visible disturbances that weren't there). So how did the murder happen? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The victim was <em>already</em> stabbed when he walked upstairs — the people watching took his unsteady walk as the result of drinking — and did so to protect the person who'd stabbed him, knowing he did not have enough time to get to a hospital, but <em>could</em> have enough time to get upstairs, hide some of the evidence, undo the binding that impeded the bleeding, and bleed out in a seemingly perfect murder...</span>
</li><li> "Melodies of Murder" is a classic locked room mystery. A musician is found shot in his dressing room, the door locked and the gun in his hand. It looks like suicide, but an old fork on the floor and a missing guitar string make DI Mooney think otherwise. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The murderer had killed the victim and staged it to look like a suicide. He then locked the door from the outside, and broke it open. He replaced the key on the inside of the door, then used the guitar string to pull the fork under the door, wedging it shut. When the police found the door seemingly locked, they broke it down, covering the damage the killer caused breaking it open.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A more diluted form sometimes appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> where the puzzle is eventually unraveled by an eccentric protagonist using more obvious clues and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>.
<ul><li> One episode involved a murder committed where all the doors and windows were locked securely from the inside. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The killer was a cable installer who unlocked a window to a hidden attic while working in the house.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, the puzzle is typically subverted when an eccentric protagonist (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">Agent Mulder</a>), on the basis of flimsy evidence and wild speculation, reveals that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> did it. In this case the monster is the one using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> in the form of special monster powers. Two episodes in Season 1 "Squeeze" and "Tooms" epitomize this trope variant, with the monster managing to get at his victims in otherwise inaccessible places through his mutant ability to squeeze through tiny vents, windows, chimneys etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> is a show built around various sealed room mysteries (which feature in 13 of its 26 episodes to date) and other seemingly impossible crimes. A few examples:
<ul><li> In "Danse Macabre", a murderer carries a hostage into a sealed room. When the door is opened, only the hostage remains. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the murderer <em>was</em> the hostage, in disguise, carrying a dummy. The dummy was cut up and stashed in the corner.</span>
</li><li> In "The Scented Room", a painting vanishes from a locked room during a school visit. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a schoolgirl used the confusion of the school trip to ensure she was locked in the room, then simply stashed the painting in a hollow door panel.</span>
</li><li> In "Jack in the Box", a man is found dead in his nuclear bomb shelter, locked from the inside. Suicide... except he was arthritic and couldn't hold a gun. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was murder-suicide - the murderer bricked himself into an unfinished wall and drugged himself to death.</span>
</li><li> In "The House of Monkeys", a scientist is found stabbed by a suit of samurai armor in his locked office. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was drugged by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">Animal Wrongs Group</a>, and while under its influence fell on the sword.</span>
</li><li> In "The Omega Man", the army seize what a prominent Ufologist claims is an alien's skeleton. While locked in a crate to take it back to base however, it vanishes. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ufologist had made it himself from frozen mercury. Locked in the crate, it simply melted away.</span>
</li><li> In "Ghosts Forge", Jonathan's assistant vanishes from a locked room while investigating a mystery. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to take him down a notch, she'd simply bribed a builder to plaster over a door in the room and hidden in there.</span>
</li><li> In "The Three Gamblers", the corpse of a dead criminal seems to have climbed the stairs from the cellar where the body was left and scratched at the door. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">flood waters moved the body, dumping it there when they receded.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in "No Trace of Tracy", where the prime suspect claims to have been handcuffed to a radiator in a room in his house at the time a girl was abducted. The solution: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while unconscious he had been carried to a replica of that room</span>
</li><li> And one incident where the <em>viewer</em> knows the solution all along <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(the victim had been stabbed earlier but had been hiding the wound both to protect her mentally unstable attacker and so she could go on stage that night, only to accidentally re-traumatise the haphazardly treated injury by banging a piece of furniture against it and bleed to death, whereupon a person who knew the truth, having found her first, hid the fake skin she'd used to conceal it from everybody else)</span>, but most of the characters don't.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> doesn't usually have crimes that look totally impossible, just ones that look impossible for Monk's prime suspect to have committed. The prime suspect is always guilty anyway.
<ul><li> "Mr. Monk and the Panic Room" has a traditional locked-room crime in an episode where a record producer is found shot inside a locked panic room which the police had to literally cut a hole in the door to enter, the only other living thing in the room being a Chimpanzee who was holding the gun when the police came in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The security man who built the room had a secret entrance</span>.
</li><li> For "Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy", the victim was a magazine publisher who died in an apparent accident while working out in a locked room. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The killer was in the room below with a very powerful magnet, which he used to make the weight the victim was using fall on his windpipe and crush it</span>.
</li><li> Some episodes turned this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, with Steve Wagner being in outer space at the time of the murder in "Mr. Monk and the Astronaut", while Brian Babbage managed to commit murder while <em>in a coma</em> in "Mr. Monk and the Sleeping Suspect". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Notably, both cases involved using the mail service as a time delay; the astronaut noosed his drugged victim to a garage door and mailed the opener to the house, the coma victim glued mail bombs to the insides of public mailboxes so they would be picked up days later. Brian Babbage also was originally planning to be arrested and locked up in jail when his bombs went off, but accidentally ended up in a coma</span>.
</li><li> In "Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale," the eponymous Dale tries to avoid blame for ordering a murder by provoking a witness report that seemed to indicate he had done it personally, knowing full well the police will determine he couldn't have done it because he weighs 804 pounds and is bedridden. In this case, it was his physician (over whom Dale has blackmail dirt) who committed the murder and wore a fatsuit for the benefit of eyewitnesses.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert" has the same solution as the <em>Death In Paradise</em> example above with "Melodies of Murder". Namely, to give the impression that his victim overdosed in a port-a-potty, Kris Kedder uses one of his guitar strings to rig the lock so he can lock it from the outside.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan">Crossing Jordan</a></em> episode involved a man who was writing a book on vampires found dead in a locked room, drained of blood and with fang wounds in his neck. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turned out to be self-inflicted.</span>
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito">Kamen Rider Agito</a></em>, the hallmark of a killing by the Unknown is that it is, by all rights, impossible - drowning in the middle of a field, being buried deep underground without any signs of digging, being entombed inside of a tree, your internal organs being ripped apart without the skin being broken, or falling to your death in a place where there's nowhere to fall <em>from.</em>

A woman is murdered on a planet, and it at first seems obvious that Scotty is the killer; he's clutching the murder weapon. But things start to get weird; after Scotty claims he couldn't remember what happened, the ruler of the planet suggests consulting his wife, who's an empath, and she gets strange visions of a great evil with a hatred of women, calling out several names like "Beratis", "Kesla" and "Redjac". Then the lights are cut, and she's killed too, again apparently by Scott — although he said he felt something come <em>between</em> him and the seer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually, the computer aboard <em>The Enterprise</em> discovers the truth, that "Redjac" is an incorporeal being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">feeds on fear</a> which has been behind several unsolved cases of serial killers on many worlds, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackTheRipper">Jack the Ripper</a>.</span>

<ul><li> In "Reunion, and Turnabout", your assistant is locked in an empty room with the victim, a gunshot is heard, and the door is opened to reveal her standing over the corpse with a smoking gun in her hand.

Adding to the mystery is that all possible suspects can corroborate each other's alibis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of the wounds were self-inflicted (yes, the victim was that crazy), but they aren't what killed him. The victim had poisoned one of the fire grenades used to extinguish the flames he used to lure everyone to the building he barred himself in, hoping he would die of the poison (like we said, crazy!). It's ruled that the murderer is the one who used the poisoned fire grenade, and there is <em>no way of telling which one was poisoned</em>.</span>

There is only one door to the study, and the room has a balcony that looks over an endless abyss. It's Apollo's job to figure out how anyone other than the defendant could have entered, killed the victim and escaped without leaving traces.

<ul><li> If criminal investigators encounter a Locked Room Mystery in real life, the usual default assumption (barring physical evidence to the contrary) is that the victim locked <em>themselves</em> in the room before succumbing to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDelayedDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDelayedDeath">Time-Delayed Death</a>. Given how rare it is for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">Instant Death Bullet</a> and/or Poison to occur outside of fiction, and how a threatened person is likely to put a barrier between themselves and an attacker if they can, this sort of unintended Locked Room Mystery happens too often in the real world to really count as a "mystery".
</li><li> Arthur C. Clarke used a Locked Room Mystery in his descriptions of spatial dimensions: if two-dimensional beings had a "bank vault" sealed on all sides — i.e. a square — then a 3D thief could remove its contents via the third dimension, leaving the 2D police baffled.
</li><li> On June 29, 1937, the body of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Laetitia_Toureaux">Laetitia Toureaux<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was found inside a wagon from the Paris Metro. Nobody was ever charged with the murder, and it remain a mystery. There have been numerous speculations regarding the murder, including the secret service and La Cagout (a French fascist anti-communist terrorist group active from 1935 to 1941).
</li><li> In March 9, 1929, police were called to the residence of <a class="urllink" href="https://hubpages.com/politics/solving-the-locked-room-mystery">Isidor Fink<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after hearing signs of a struggle. When they arrived they found Fink dead of three gunshot wounds. However, the door was bolted shut, the windows were nailed down and the only fingerprints in the room belonged to Fink himself. The only way anyone would have gotten in was via a small window above the door but only a child could go through the opening. Someone firing through the window was also out of the question since Fink's wounds indicated he was shot at close range and that it was impossible for him to have shot himself (and the murder weapon wasn't found in the room). Motive was also unclear since even though it was a high crime area and Fink was extremely paranoid about getting robbed (hence all the extra security), none of his valuables were taken. No culprit was ever found and NYPD Police Commissioner Edward P. Mulrooney called the case an "insoluble mystery".
