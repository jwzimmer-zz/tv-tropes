</li><li> Hiding Identity:<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At least there are two known cases with different tweak; One case involve murder of a family member with the fake character created by <em>the killer</em> while another one has <em>the victim</em> creating another identity which was used by the killer in the scheme.

Ataru, being girl-crazy, doesn't notice that the note is signed "Kumino Otoko" which, beside being a proper Japanese female name, can also be read as "Men of the Class". Ataru gets saved from the humiliation when his beloved Lum shows up in disguise as the non-existent Miss Kumino. <br/><br/>The English translation of the manga changed the name to "Shinobi Nobade" to have a pun that works in English. (Incidentally, the manga's version of this story was very different. Ataru's classmates were jealous of the amount of love letters Mendo gets, so they wrote a fake love letter from "Kumino Otoko" to Ataru which included many insults directed at Mendo. They didn't expect Mendo and Ataru to make a bet on whether or not Kumino Otoko was pretty, thus requiring someone to pretend to be Kumino Otoko.)

Of course, he then has to sit down with a profiler to give a description of the assailant. Using only a fruit bowl in the room as inspiration, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZxFIAFTfEU">he describes the "assailant"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a toothless, one-eyed, scarfaced clown with curly orange hair.

When the emperor eventually demands to meet "General Kijé", he is sadly reported killed in battle. The film is known today for the orchestral suite of the music written by Sergei Prokofiev.

Initially created as a digital replacement for an actress who had abruptly quit the production, Simone quickly becomes immensely popular, leaving her "discoverer" behind in the dust and forcing him to kill her off... only to become a suspect in her disappearance and presumed murder.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WagTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WagTheDog">Wag the Dog</a></em>, to make the fake war in Albania more "real", Hollywood director Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) invents a special operations soldier trapped behind enemy lines. A series of setbacks, including the soldier dying before his staged return, forces them to explain his death, and they even mount an elaborate viral memorial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"meme"</a> by throwing tennis shoes in trees.

However, after a famous author was murdered, the police declared Livingstone the top suspect because of his well-documented hatred of the man. This forces the conspirators to publicly confess, not wanting to taint the investigation (they add that the hatred of the author was just a character quirk they invented and didn't reflect their individual feelings). The confession prompts one girl (who tearfully says she dumped her boyfriend for Livingstone) to cut all ties with the fandom, and a wake was promptly declared to mourn the lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">Big Name Fan</a>.

The outgoing governor misunderstands a remark by one of his aides about plans to mark the changeover, and soon rumors are spreading far and wide about Mark Changeover, a mysterious figure who is probably some kind of terrorist. In the end, to save face for the governor, the country's incoming president agrees to be Mark Changeover, and seizes control of the nation in a bloodless coup the day before it was due to be handed over to him anyway.

</li><li> In one Anatole France story, an imaginary friend blamed for childish misdeeds ends up as the scapegoat for local crime including seducing and impregnating a maid.

Noone go on an office rampage at a furniture importing business, killing three of his coworkers and injuring the fourth, Sarabeth Willow, then apparently managing to slip out of the building undetected by the police. Monk discovers very early on that "Wyatt Noone" is a phony name ("Wyatt is no one"). Then eventually in the end, it turns out "Wyatt" isn't even a real person: the other four workers "he" shot invented him to be their nonexistent financial manager. The reason they did so was to skim a little bonus money from their boss who wasn't giving them pay raises. The one survivor of the shooting, Sarabeth, began embezzling a bigger cut to pay for her husband's cancer treatments, which the others weren't happy about.

Meanwhile, Dodd, who gets to say "Told you so," has twisted the story to make it look like he was right all along, furthering his claim to rightful clan leadership and to the idea that his mother, or any woman, cannot lead the family.

When Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher swing by the bank after hours upon following a lead on the bank manager, though, the sole employee there at the time, Madge, suddenly reveals she was in on the robbery too by locking the four in the bank vault and leaving them to suffocate. While they're trapped, Monk notices some discarded toothpicks in the vault and makes the conclusion that there wasn't even a robbery; the entire bank staff schemed to fake the robbery. The mysterious Russian was played by Madge, and the teller who got shot agreed to do so for the sake of making their performance look authentic.

Similarly, host Rob Brydon once claimed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> truthfully</span> that in the early years of his career he was too shy to haggle over pay as himself so he would call his employers pretending to be his (non-existent) agent and ask for a higher rate of pay for his "client".

He's in three yearbooks, was registered for every single course in every semester when Georgia Tech computerized its registration, had his marriage announced in a paper in the 1950s, got a mention of his 50th anniversary in the 2000s, and <em>MAD Magazine</em> listed him on the board of directors for about twelve years.

Despite Andrew being a notorious fibber and later admitting the story was a lie, when Jim Garrison launched his investigation of the assassination, he latched onto the idea that the name was an alias of businessman Clay Shaw, pretty much entirely because of the first name and Shaw being homosexual. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliverStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliverStone">Oliver Stone's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK">JFK</a></em> takes the idea and runs with it, making many assassination buffs cry.
</li><li> When the comedian Ronnie Barker wanted to try writing for <em>The Frost Report</em> (the sketch show he was appearing in at the time), he decided to write under a pseudonym so that his sketches would be accepted on their merit. The ruse worked and 'Gerald Wiley' became one of the most highly regarded writers of the show. The cast and crew speculated as to who he really was (names such as Alan Ayckbourn and Tom Stoppard were suggested). Ronnie Barker kept up the pretense, occasionally criticizing the quality of the writing and at one point when Ronnie Corbett tried to buy the rights to one sketch, telling Corbett that the price 'Wiley' was asking was far too high.
</li><li> This is the origin of the term "John Doe" (and Jane Doe and other such variants) being used as a placeholder name for unidentified persons. According to English Common Law at least two witnesses were needed for criminal proceedings, so prosecutors would occasionally put the name on the books for unimportant trials. There was also a complicated procedure in housing law that was simplified if both sides were acting for third parties; if there were no third parties, they'd claim to be acting on behalf of John Doe and Richard Roe.

In 1943 a ruse was conducted to trick the Germans into believing the invasion of southern Europe would start with Greece instead of Sicily. A homeless man's corpse was given the fictional identity of a Royal Marine named Major William Martin, his body was planted with fake documents detailing the planned invasion of Greece and he was dropped off near the Spanish coast. The Germans were completely taken in and redirected vital military units from Sicily to Greece, ensuring the success of the Sicilian Invasion. The subterfuge was extremely detailed; "Major Martin's" body was planted with fake letters from his 'fiancee' (one of the department secretaries contributed a photograph of herself) and 'father', as well as facsimile concert stubs, restaurant receipts, an unpaid jeweler's invoice for an engagement ring, a overdraft notice from his bank, and other assorted pocket-clutter designed to create the illusion of a slightly forgetful and occasionally careless man. This personality was concocted in order to provide an explanation of why the official document case was handcuffed to the body - which was necessary to ensure that body and case would wash up together, but not normal practice for military couriers. The story later became a book and a movie, under the name <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoNeverWas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoNeverWas">The Man Who Never Was</a></em>; more recently, a detailed investigative account was written by Ben MacIntyre, which uncovered, among other things, the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">someone had gone to the trouble</a> of inserting a fake entry in an inn's registration book, to make it appear that the equally fictional father of "Martin" had been staying there during the period when one of the fake personal letters was written.
</li><li> Take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> later in the war with Operation Fortitude. The idea here was to fool the Germans into thinking the Invasion of Europe (D-Day) would happen at Calais and NOT Normandy. To this end the Allies invented an entire ARMY and put actual General George S. Patton in charge of it. The ruse worked very well as the Nazis kept A LOT of equipment away from Normandy and even thought NORMANDY was a ruse to distract them from the REAL invasion yet to come at Calais.

He then gave the Nazis useful but publicly available information, thereby gaining their trust, and while there were some mistakes, they weren't noticed. And then he was finally able to get hired by the British as what is known as a "walk-in" (basically someone who goes to a country, embassy or the like and asks to be a spy for them). Before he did that, they thought his information was legit (they intercepted at least some of it) and launched a spy hunt. After they hired him, he was used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole">feed the Nazis information</a>, as he'd wanted from the start. Sometimes they needed to give legit information for trust reasons, which was done with care; for example, one of his imaginary spies 'sent him' useful information, but due to an 'unfortunate and entirely coincidental' mail mishap, it arrived too late for the Nazis to use it. Or, in the case of the true location for freakin' <em>D-Day</em>, due to finding out entirely too late. Agent Arabel even got an Iron Cross Second Class (which requires the Führer's personal authorization) for his contribution to the war effort, which would have been been bestowed upon him personally by Hitler himself if it wouldn't have blown his cover - this, coupled with being awarded the MBE for his work as a double-agent, makes him the only known person to win an award from <em>both sides</em> of World War II. One of his fictitious subordinates was too well placed, so they killed him and put his name in the obituary of a British newspaper. He told the Nazis of the 'tragedy', who then proceeded to <em>send the imaginary widow flowers</em>. Said imaginary spy was replaced by his imaginary wife. His cover lasted so long that Hitler died not knowing his favored spy Agent Arabel was a double agent, let alone disloyal from the start. You can read about this amazing tale (including some of the fake spies) in several places, one of which is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/mi5-history/world-war-ii/agent-garbo.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> It gets better than that. All the 27 fake spies were paid a stipend by the Nazi government for their "services". <strong>All that money was actually going <em>straight</em> into the British Treasury</strong>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A prank at Brown University several years ago played with this trope. A club dedicated to practical jokes (or something like that) picked a random freshman at the beginning of the year and began posting on school forums and message boards about how amazed and excited they were that he actually went to their school: "omg, can you believe it?", "I think I saw him in the lunchline!", "it's so cool, he goes here", etc, etc, etc. After only a month or two, practically everyone at the school knew the guy's name and face and that he was famous (though nobody was ever quite sure for what). The freshman target himself was probably the most confused by the whole thing until he finally ran into one of the perpetrators who explained what had been going on months later, but enjoyed the attention and minor acclaim for most of his time in college none-the-less.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Tate">Nat Tate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, supposedly a famous artist who destroyed most of his work before killing himself, whose "biography" was written by William Boyd. In reality, Boyd seems to have just wanted to make fun of art critics, and was assisted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a></em>. Only one editor at the book's launch party realized it was a hoax; he realized something was off when everyone <em>except</em> him claimed that yes, of course they were familiar with Tate and his work.
</li><li> Similar to the fictional student is the fake building once created on the UBC campus in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. Students in the psychology and sociology programs inserted a non-existent building into the campus maps and records; the hoax remained undetected until the next semester when instructors assigned classrooms in the fictitious building were unable to find it, despite the alleged location of the building being in clear view of the front of the campus' primary administrative building.

His writings, actually by a collective of satirists from <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literaturnaya_Gazeta">Literaturnaya Gazeta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, parodied many cliches used by a typical Soviet writer.
</li><li> Allegra Coleman, the fictional actress (portrayed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliLarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliLarter">Ali Larter</a> in photographs) created by Martha Sherrill in <em>Esquire</em> magazine, demonstrating that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHypeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHypeMachine">Hollywood Hype Machine</a> didn't require an actual person behind the hype.
</li><li> Ern Malley, the Australian poet, created by actual Australian poets James MacAuley and Harold Stewart to hoax the modernist magazine <em>Angry Penguins</em>. The magazine dedicated an entire issue to Malley's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">deliberately bad</a>) work, which MacAuley and Stewart claimed as evidence the modernists couldn't tell good poetry from bad.
</li><li> Musician <a class="urllink" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/07/17/423612001/can-you-have-an-album-on-itunes-if-you-dont-exist?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20150720">Lucia Cole<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had an album on iTunes and 64,000 Twitter followers, was interviewed in a few web publications, and was endorsed by Shaquille O'Neal. But the consensus is that her entire existence was an elaborate hoax: her supposed label, Republic Records, said no one was signed with them under that name, photographs posted to her official site turned out to be pictures of a model named Reese Cromwell, and her album consisted entirely of old, slightly re-titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessicaSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessicaSimpson">Jessica Simpson</a> recordings. Following these revelations, Cole's only album <em>Innocence</em> was quickly pulled from all digital platforms - it's not exactly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostEpisode">Lost Episode</a> because, again, it consisted entirely of re-labeled Jessica Simpson songs.

</li><li> In the 70's, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAykroyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a> was asked to fill out a form for <em>Who's Who</em>. As a joke, he made up a wife named Maureen Lewis and three children with her. Surprisingly, this information was published in the book without being verified. Aykroyd would later get married in 1982 to Donna Dixon, who does actually exist.
</li><li> It is very likely that Homer, the Greek historian who told the tales of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>, was not a real person at all. The root of this theory is that the stories had their roots in oral retellings which were passed from town to town, the details changing along the way like a game of telephone. Many historians believe that Homer was invented to give the cobbled together tales a source of origin. There's three base elements to this theory: 1) Homeric epic shares many stylistic characteristics with known oral traditions; 2) Thanks to the sophistication and mnemonic power of the formulaic system in Homeric poetry, it is entirely possible for epics as large as the Iliad and Odyssey to have been created in an oral tradition, 3) many curious features that offended the ancient Alexandrians and the Analysts are most probably symptomatic of the poems' evolution through oral transmission and, within limits, poets re-inventing them in performance, and 4) various continuity errors within the work.
<ul><li> Book 24 of <em>The Odyssey</em> is a notable case here. It's believed by scholars that the Homer part of the poem ended with Odysseus revealing himself to Penelope, and that the last book was written by someone else. Several passages in earlier books seem to be setting up the events of Book 24, so if it were indeed a later addition, the offending editor would seem to have changed earlier text as well.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2001 Sony Pictures <a class="urllink" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1495591/Sony-ordered-to-pay-1.5m-for-film-goer-hoax.html">invented<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a fake movie critic, David Manning, to give rave reviews to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale">A Knight's Tale</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAnimal">The Animal</a></em>.
</li><li> Trap streets are nonexistent streets or towns that are put on a map to "trap" anyone who tries to copy the map, as if caught, they'll be unable to explain the inclusion of the nonexistent street as innocent.
<ul><li> In 1936, Esso created a fake town called Agloe on their map of New York State, outside Roscoe. In the 1950s, a general store was built on that spot, and the owners, consulting the Esso map, decided to call it the Agloe General Store. Years later, Rand McNally tried to copy Esso's map, and then Esso tried to sue them. The suit was tossed because the general store meant Agloe was now a real place.
