</li><li> A subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em>. Racer X knows he's the long lost brother, but no one else does. This is also true in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, wherein they made a plausible explanation for it because movie Speed wasn't quite as <strike>stupid</strike> innocent as his anime counterpart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> has Kurosaki Mea who claims to be Yami's little sister.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> plays with this; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirmed that Lina's first traveling companion, the flaky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Naga the Serpent</a>, is in fact Gracia Ul Naga Seyruun, the first princess of Seyruun and the long-lost sister of one of Lina's later companions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Amelia</a>. They sort of meet three times in continuity: the <em>Slayers Evolution-R</em> anime had Naga's soul trapped in a suit of armor and became an ally for the group for five episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">''Slayers Premium''</a> had Amelia be blasted away before Naga appeared, and the radio drama following the movie had them briefly meet, but Naga simply told Amelia (who didn't recognize her) that she was a friend of Lina's.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> kicks off with the dual revelations that Goku A) is an alien and B) has a much stronger evil older brother.
</li><li> More than a decade later, the new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em> special gives Vegeta a brother as well. His brother, however, is younger and much weaker, and apparently Vegeta knew of his existence already.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, it turns out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is kind of Ed and Al's <em>elder brother</em>, since he recognized their father as his father, back before he pulled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">From Nobody to Nightmare</a>, and turned Hohenheim into a monster, too. Complicated by the fact that this 'son' was also kind of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">mentor</a>, giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">a name instead of a number</a> and teaching him to read.
</li><li> This relationship means that the homunculi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">are all technically Ed's nieces and nephews</a>. But no one makes anything of this within the series.
<ul><li> Even when Ed and Al first meet Father, he fixes them up since they're his precious human sacrifices and is fascinated to discover that they're Van Hohenheim's sons and Hohenheim is still alive after all these years, but doesn't therefore think of them in even vaguely familial terms. He seems to restrict those completely to his children; he also doesn't address Hohenheim as his father. Ed and Al return this lack of regard, though since they don't view the flashbacks they may never actually see it put in these terms.
</li><li> Genetically, since Hohenheim was his only parent, once he gets a body Father is Hohenheim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>, making him also arguably the brothers' uncle. When he crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishounenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishounenLine">Bishounen Line</a> during the finale, he gets described as '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">the one who looks like Fullmetal without the automail</a>', although he's actually prettier and has somewhat different hair.
</li><li> The relationship between the brothers and the homonculi was referenced at one point near the end when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride, his philosophers stone exhausted and body crumbling, attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">take Ed's body</a> as the reason it was possible was due to that relationship. They're a very creepy family</span>.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake">4Koma Theater</a> gags—Ed reveals to Al that the two of them aren't really two brothers...
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Al:</strong> So you mean, this blood seal isn't even real!? And I'm <em>not</em> your younger brother!? <br/><strong>Ed:</strong> No, that is a genuine blood seal and you're definitely my younger brother...but your helmet is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">our younger <em>sister</em></span>. <br/><strong>Al's Helmet:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">HI BIG BROTHER AL!</span> <br/><strong>Al:</strong> AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
</div><ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>, this is not the case, though during the climatic final battle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that the homunculus Envy is the resurrection-attempt of the son of Dante and Hohenheim, making him sort of Ed and Al's half-brother (as much as Sloth is their mother), depending on how much was retained in the bringing-back-to-life process. Exactly why he looks like Hohenheim's current body, given that Hohenheim is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surfer</a>, despite being centuries old is anyone's guess</span>.

They'd almost universally be either Usagi or Mamoru's long-lost sister, though once in a great while Usagi would have a brother (since apparently she doesn't get enough grief from Shingo) or one of the other senshi would suddenly sprout a sibling or two. What was particularly odd with Usagi's many sisters was how often they were her <em>older</em> sibling, but were still usually banished (and thus forgotten by everyone until after the canon series) for breaking the "one heir" rule. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oxxt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oxxt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oxxt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> When discussing whether or not Chibi Chibi was Sailor Moon's second daughter from the future in the <em>Stars</em> arc of the <em>Sailor Moon</em> manga, the Sailor Quartet claimed to have heard a rumor that says Moon Queens can only have one child throughout their entire reigns.
