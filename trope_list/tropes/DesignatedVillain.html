</div></div><p>A villainous antagonist is a common driving force behind conflict in stories, so it makes natural sense to write one in. But villainy requires performing <em>villainous acts</em>; a villain who doesn't really act on those is difficult to root against.

</p><p>Naturally, this can boomerang back onto the protagonist and make them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> — a character regarded as "good" despite having no significant virtues — as often, the "villain" is only considered such because they dislike/oppose the "hero".

Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a> isn't a case of having weaksauce villains; it's a personification of being an ass for its own sake, and being lauded for it. In both cases one has to be certain about the creator's intentions about who's sympathetic and who is right. Particularly bad attempts to avert this may include having the character in question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> in a completely unrelated situation, which proves that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">no, they're not a good person</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">but still doesn't prove that they were wrong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem">in the main conflict that they participated in</a>.

<ul><li> Sio is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai">Afro Samurai</a>: Resurrection</em>. Let's overlook what she does to Afro directly. Name one thing that Sio does to earn her the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> of wickedness given to her by Professor Dharman (Go on, we'll wait)? Afro Samurai runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a> anyway, however, given all of the heinous things that Afro does in his quest for revenge, and how Sio wound up the way she did, it's hard to say that anything she does to Afro in particular makes her evil. Hell, she lied about torturing Afro's father: she doesn't even keep her word when she's talking about hurting people she hates. That said, the runner up for evil things that Sio did in the story is her sexually humiliating an evil person who wanted to be sexually humiliated. This is really a victimless crime any way it's viewed. She can't even get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> status, because she doesn't perpetrate villainy against anyone other than Afro. Sio is such a designated villain, that in any other story (or if the screentime focused on her more than Afro), she could arguably be an anti-hero.
</li><li> Dinosaur Ryuzaki (Rex Raptor) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is more of a "villain by proxy", as his best friend (only in the anime) is the downright rotten Insector Haga (Weevil Underwood). He is shown helping Jonouchi (Joey) on occasion, and is more just a jerk than an actual villain, but ends up selling his soul for power in the Doma arc anyway (also only in the anime and filler no less, making this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>).
</li><li> Gauche and Droite (Nistro and Dextra) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> debut as villains because they want to expel Tokunosuke (Flip) from the World Duel Carnival tournament. Why did they want to expel Tokunosuke from the tournament? Because he was swindling people out of their Heart Pieces. He was breaking the rules of the tournament and directly screwing over other people. Even if the punishment (confiscating his deck and expelling him from the WDC for life) was pretty excessive, Gauche and Droite were just doing their jobs. Even though the moral of the franchise has been that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">Cheaters Never Prosper</a> since day one, we're expected to root for Yuma when he comes to Tokunosuke's defense, because he's Yuma's friend (and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">that's a pretty dubious title</a>) when, if that weren't the case, Yuma would almost certainly be the one dueling <em>him</em>.
<ul><li> Justified somewhat, as in their debut appearances, they were seen helping Kite and Mr. Heartland, the former of whom was already introduced as a villain. In addition, they approved of Tombo Tillbitty's "Basket Rule", when said rule had been seen causing physical harm to several Duelists. Their main "redemption" move was quitting the WDC staff to become entrants because they enjoy dueling more than working security.

He ruled his land with tyranny because he became addicted to blood rubies. So Goku and his friends try to stop the evil king from gathering the Dragon Balls and making his "terrible wish" of wishing himself free of the blood ruby hunger... <em>which would solve the problem itself!</em> Averted in the Japanese version, where he wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousGlutton">wish for finer foods</a>.
</li><li> Donan Cassim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram">Fang of the Sun Dougram</a></em>. The reason why he's so determined to keep the colony planet a part of the Earth Federation is that he wants to use the manpower and technology to develop two nearby mineral-rich planets and save an exhausted Earth, but he's the local authority figure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority">and therefore the villain</a>. At some point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">authors</a> themselves realized that he's a little too sympathetic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">installed his aide</a>, the genuinely evil and loathsome Helmut J Lecoque, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> instead</span>.
</li><li> Luc displays an odd case of this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII">Suikoden III</a></em> Mameanga, where he goes to considerable effort to hide the fact that he's trying to save the world (through mass genocide, but still). When the hero finds this out, he even rants about not needing sympathy for his actions. He was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> even when he was a good guy.
<ul><li> He got his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> from his mentor, who when he <em>asked</em> if there was any way to save everyone without killing everyone, just looked at him and was silent.

The problem with this, other then the very idea of Cyclops going from X-Men's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> leader to a villain, is that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killed Xavier</span> while being controlled by the Dark Phoenix. No one in-universe brings up the fact that he was under the powers of a force strong enough to defeat Galactus in favor of just being a dick to him. This includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, a guy who killed another member of the X-Men (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Northstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Northstar">Northstar</a>) while brainwashed.

For over a year, readers wanted to know just what exactly he did (especially since an early story seemed to paint the mutant Sunfire as just as bad), only for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfX">Death of X</a></em> to reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cyclops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">wasn't even alive when he acted!</a> It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a>, who somehow convinced the world that he led a group of mutants to alter the Terrigen Mists so that they would be safe for all. And he was disintegrated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt">Black Bolt</a> for his actions</span>! Much of this owed to the fact that Marvel, being overzealous in protecting from leaks, hadn't told the writers what Cyclops did aside from it apparently being really, really bad. Writers naturally assumed it had to be something seriously awful, hence the comparisons to Hitler, when the actual bad thing turned out to be kind of neutral.
</li><li> A minor example sees Hellion punished by Cyclops for killing Karima. Even though she was attacking Utopia, there was absolutely <em>no one else</em> able to stop her from killing everyone there, and the <em>entire crux</em> of Cyclops's side during the Schism was that the kids needed to be trained to fight and defend themselves. He ends up being shipped off to Wolverine at the Jean Grey School, who goes so far as <em>locking him up</em> despite Logan having done far, <em>far</em> worse himself and been forgiven for it. Yet pretty much every book Hellion appeared in at the time attempted to drive home just how horrible and wrong his actions were.

</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ThePrayerWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ThePrayerWarriors">The Prayer Warriors</a></em> villains are simply people who aren't Christian.

On top of that his motives were somewhat justified in the film as all he wanted was credit for his accomplishments. Yet the filmmakers seem to think he's the villain for whatever reason.

He is portrayed as a budding sociopath for his cruelty to toys, but he can't be faulted for the way he treats his toys since he doesn't actually know that they're alive; the worst thing he knowingly does is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">bully his younger sister Hannah</a>. Amusingly, a few of Pixar's employees have said that they too used to mess with their toys, and jokingly called Andy "a freak" for treating his so nicely. His dog Scud plays it even more straight. While he is still considered a threat, he can't be faulted for chewing up the toys since his aggression was most likely brought on by Sid and chewing toys isn't exactly an unusual thing for dogs to do.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> backstory is that he lived in a forest that was cut down to build the Niceland Apartments, which leads to him wrecking up the place as the game's bad guy. However, his Designated Villain status carries over to when the game characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">off the clock</a> too, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> shunning him because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor">plays the role of the bad guy</a>.

He rips apart appliances and uses the parts to build new ones, and since the film is from the viewpoint of the <em>appliances</em> he is equated to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein">Doctor Frankenstein</a></em>. The ones trapped in his shop have gone mad from watching it over and over.

He's portrayed as Saddam's henpecked boyfriend for the most part, but it really sinks in during his <em>Up There</em> song, which reveals that his role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">the villain to humanity is just a job</a> and he only wants to take over Earth to enjoy what humans take for granted. This carries over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">the series</a>, which repeatedly shows Satan as a featured character in episodes that also show Catholic Church guilt-tripping their patrons and forcing little boys into sex-slavery.
</li><li> In the Christmas special short film <em>The Small One</em> the tanner is portrayed as a terrifying villain who wants to buy the boy's donkey to skin and make leather out of him. In other words he's nothing more than a working man making a living. It's also worth noting that he does nothing dishonest at any point in the film when the boy asks if he'll take good care of his donkey he flat out states he's only interested in the hide when he could've simply reassured the boy "Sure, I'll take care of him." and had more business.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em>: Smiler is played up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> when really, she is only trying to prevent Textopolis' <em>death</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightWeeksLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightWeeksLater">28 Weeks Later</a></em> tries hard to portray Dom as this. Leaving his wife to die, lying to his kids about what happened. Then grabbing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and getting infected and causing a fresh breakout would put him in this bracket, however in the context of the setting, combined with bad writing combine to ruin this.
<ul><li> Had his wife not given away the survivors' location at the start by letting in a child, there's a good chance they would have been fine, not to mention Dom was unable to reach her due to an infected in the way and more coming, survival instinct kicked in right there. Not to mention he would have never reached his wife in time to prevent her from being bitten (she was on the second floor of a house, he outside) and attempting to do so meant fighting off no less than <em>ten infected</em> with his bare hands (it's established in the film fighting a single infected one-on-one unarmed is effectively a death sentence).
</li><li> He doesn't exactly lie to his kids as he breaks down before getting to that part, not to mention he never actually sees what happened to her. Plus he is shown to be very guilt-ridden about the whole matter as it is. Yet his kids flat out accuse him of lying about everything.
</li><li> Speaking of which, he had every right to be furious about them leaving the safe-zone. When you have the most deadly plague in history which has ravaged Britain in less than a month out there and the US Army enforcing the rules then you would be pissed, yet the film forgets that to focus on how him lying was so terrible and he is shown to struggle to find a response, making it seem like his kids have any moral high ground.
</li><li> While he stupidly went and kisses his now-alive wife and got infected, why was she not being guarded? Plus, had he succeeded in killing his son while under the effects of the virus, then it's likely the rest of the world would have been fine.

Harsh? Yes. Necessary? <em>Yes</em>. It's the most deadly plague in human history, it spreads so unbelievably fast it's simply too deadly to try and tell if someone's infected or not (and if he is and he spots you, you have about two seconds before he's on you biting and vomiting infected blood in your face), and they've now learned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyphoidMary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyphoidMary">people can be asymptomatic carriers</a>.

Sure, she's a bitch to Georgia, and doesn't seem particularly loveable, but it's kinda excused by the fact that Georgia is trying to steal her boyfriend throughout the film. To make matters worse, in the book series that the film is based on, she is known as "Wet Lindsay", and is basically despised by Georgia for being a wimp.
<ul><li> Lindsay only began to show signs of bitchiness after Georgia's constant attempts to steal her boyfriend become enormously apparent. In many ways, Georgia is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>, blatantly insulting Lindsay throughout the film, treating her friends and parents horribly and using everyone as a means to an end to get with Robbie.
</li></ul></li><li> Dean Wormer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse">Animal House</a></em> movie has every right to hate and put the Delta Fraternity on probation due to their disruptive antics, continuously poor academic standing, and flouting the school's rules. He also had reasons and authority to expel the members (plus he actually started plotting to expel them only after he was threatened into doing something about it).
</li><li> Amy Squirrel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTeacher">Bad Teacher</a></em>, thanks to her repeated, downright obsessive efforts to expose Elizabeth, the title character, for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. Elizabeth is superficial, vain, lazy and mostly incompetent, a drug user, doesn't help her kids to learn (her success is achieved through <em>cheating</em>), she doesn't learn anything herself except perhaps to be slightly less superficial and jealously causes her to ruin Amy's life. She breaks multiple laws and rules and her only selfless acts are brief attempts to make some of her kids a little more cool. In short she is a terrible person and does almost nothing to justify the fact that the audience are supposed to root for her. Amy's methods are overbearing and underhanded, but it doesn't change the fact that she's absolutely right. Yet somehow, the audience is supposed to cheer for Elizabeth and see her wrecking Amy's life as a good and/or amusing thing.
</li><li> The villain of the 1996 made-for-TV horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeast">The Beast</a></em> is Schuyler Graves. He's the bad guy because: 1) He's richer than the hero, and 2) He has a less manly first name.
</li><li> Did <em>anyone</em> think that Faulkner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BioDome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BioDome">Bio-Dome</a></em> was the bad guy? The stoner protagonists already screwed up his expensive experiment upon entering the dome, but he was willing to let them stay in the dome, getting free food and living in a paradise of an environment for a year rather than ejecting them and prosecuting them for trespassing. When the protagonists then proceeded to ruin every experiment he tried to conduct within the dome (including <em>trying to rape</em> two female scientists), he locked them off to stop them from ruining it even more. The only time in the film he does anything approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> is when he decides to blow the dome up, but considering that the protagonists had held, of all things, a massive party with hundreds of people in the dome, ruining an experiment that cost him billions... Yeah, the film is less "radical youths stick it to the Man" and more "man's life's work ruined by moronic pothead assholes."

</li><li> Jordan's father in the latter half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cocktail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cocktail">Cocktail</a></em> is a villain purely because he won't let Brian and Jordan get back together. Brian being the same man who despite falling in love with Jordan immediately cheated on her with an older woman, and who didn't exactly have a positive reaction to the news that Jordan was pregnant with his child. Even though Mr. Mooney ended up disowning Jordan when she took Brian back, considering Brian's track record to that point his condemnation and derision of Brian was perfectly justified.

Even if he is a jerk, it doesn't change the fact that Becca goes on to owe tens of thousands of dollars due to her obsession with shopping and she has to pay for it. This is notably an adaptation-only case, as in the book, Becca acknowledges this happening and that Derek has devoted a lot of his and the bank's resources to get Becca to pay and gave her many chances to do so, for which she deeply apologizes and promises to start working off her debt.
</li><li> Amy's mother and aunt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties">Cuties</a></em>, supposedly, for their traditional beliefs about women and their role in their culture. Even when they discover about Amy's out of control behavior and provocative wardrobe, their reactions weren't that unjustified since, in the mother's words, "you lied to me. You steal from me," which are things that Amy actually did. Granted, the mother's first response was to slap her but for the most part, she was panicking and sobbing while any other conservative Muslim family could've done much worse, especially in real life.
</li><li> Jillian in the Lifetime TV Movie, <em>Dear Santa,</em> is supposed to be seen as the bad guy because... she has a loving relationship with Derek. Her attempts at thwarting Crystal are completely justified because she has stalked Derek and tried to sabotage their relationship.

</li><li> <em>Expelled</em>: Principal Gary Truman is shown to be completely justified in suspending and expelling Felix O'Neill because of his rule-breaking behavior, but is depicted as the antagonist only because Felix is the protagonist and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">constantly framing himself in the right</a>. Truman is strict, but mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> and he's clearly lost his patience with Felix because he can't get him to stop breaking the rules. It gets even worse when the movie has Felix discover Truman is embezzling the school's money in order to pay his gambling debts. The writers had to make him a criminal because they couldn't make him unlikable or wrong any other way.
</li><li> From the standpoint of the protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive">Fast Five</a></em>, Hernan Reyes is this. While he's a drug dealer and murderer to be sure, they only ran afoul of him because he'd hired them to steal some cars and they broke the deal because they realized his people were only really interested in one of the cars which turned out to have important information regarding his business. They really had no reason to do this as they were just hired to steal the cars. This ultimately results in a high speed chase dragging a ten ton vault through the streets of Rio where the "heroes" cause untold damage. The police in the film are absolutely this unless we are to believe EVERY SINGLE cop in Rio is on the drug dealer's payroll.
</li><li> The New York district attorney Sean Kierney in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindMeGuilty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindMeGuilty">Find Me Guilty</a></em>. Throughout the film, Kierney is the rival to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> Jackie DiNorscio. Despite coming off as something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, at no point in the film is Kierney wrong about his reasons as to why Jackie and his associates deserve to be convicted. However, the film goes out of its way to portray Jackie as the blameless hero (who at best will try to explain his flaws with halfassed reasoning) and Kierney is presented as a crusading zealot out to enforce the claimed "government oppression" of Italian-Americans. He ends up being a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Character</a> for how easily Jackie outmaneuvers him. Granted, this was based on historical events, but even still, the movie is clearly not on his side when he's one of the few characters in the movies who's simply looking for justice.
</li><li> Dan Sanders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FurryVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FurryVengeance">Furry Vengeance</a></em> is a nice guy who just happens to work for a company that wants to tear down the forest. However, because he works for the company, even though he has no real power in whether or not the forest will be destroyed (as he's pretty much just the land developer and, therefore, the middle man), we are supposed to be delighted when the animals beat him up.
</li><li> The bodybuilding documentary <em>Generation Iron</em> does this with the multiple time Mr. Olympia champion, Phil "The Gift" Heath. All his edited interview clips make him come off as stuck up and arrogant, in contrast to his rival Kai Greene, who is shown as humble, philosophical, and the underdog. This was done intentionally to add some drama to what would otherwise be a standard bodybuilding film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegaguirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegaguirus">Godzilla vs. Megaguirus</a></em>: Godzilla, of all characters, manages to be this. The Godzilla of this film is one of the less violent incarnations of the character, who only attacks Japan because he was attracted to a nuclear power plant and later plasma energy. When Godzilla attacks Japan again, it is revealed to have been because some humans were conducting tests with plasma energy, ignoring how such technology is illegal and capable of attracting him. While Godzilla is certainly dangerous, his actions do not justify the extreme lengths the humans go to kill him including building a black hole weapon. Furthermore, in trying to kill Godzilla using said black hole weapon, the humans wound up bringing film's other titular monster, which was only stopped by Godzilla himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldThroughTheFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldThroughTheFire">Gold Through the Fire</a></em>: The school biology teacher is portrayed as bad just for saying to Peter that, while he may disagree with evolution, it's what they teach (as this is the scientific consensus) and he isn't allowed to disrupt things, nor later write his objections rather than the actual answers in a paper.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> movie's villain was a land-developer who wanted to pave an empty field to build a mall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows">Todd in the Shadows</a> pointed out that a mall would actually have greatly boosted the economy of the town, attracted more people (such as tourists or prospective home-buyers, which would have <em>also</em> improved economy) and that the guy wants to pave an <em>empty field that has no real use.</em> Yet the audience is expected to root against him just because he's a land developer in a movie aimed at teen girls.

</li><li> Keith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaLaLand">La La Land</a></em> is a Jazz musician who understands the traditional form a Jazz is no longer popular like it used to be, and to save the music, he must adapt to what the younger people are listening to today. He creates a successful Jazz Fusion band. Too bad he is not the hero of the story. Sebastian, who is a Jazz traditionalist doesn't want to change anything and thinks anyone doing so is a sellout and a traitor. Keith is shown as nice guy and just as passionate about Jazz as Sebastian, but the film makes it seem like he is in the wrong for wanting to change the music from what it used to be, despite Jazz itself being a form of music that was created as something new and none traditional and something that evolved over time, never staying the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Peter Ludlow is the head of InGen Corporation, and is primarily made out to be the main villain by Ian's group. Yet, all of his actions throughout the film are pragmatic, well-reasoned and entirely understandable. In a deleted scene from the opening, Ludlow removes John Hammond from the board of directors, correctly pointing out that Hammond's experiment has resulted in tens of millions of dollars being lost, the deaths of at least five people, and a little girl getting injured by Compsognathus when her family strayed too close to "site B", and then correctly pointing out that the only way to save the company is to authorize a relaunch of the park at their backup site. Despite the fact that he acts generally callous towards Ian, Sarah and Nick (who are outsiders), InGen still rescues them during the climax when they reach the operations center. Even when they get back to San Diego, Ludlow invites Ian and Sarah in to his private launch event despite them acting like dicks to the security guards. After all this (and the T-Rex escaping), all he receives is a response from Ian that "now (he's) John Hammond" a short while before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gets eaten by a baby T-Rex as its father watches</span>.
</li><li> The human villains have this trait specifically so that their arguments can be dismissed. While they were shown to be quite ruthless when dealing with the dinosaurs, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Heroes</a> were directly or indirectly responsible for every human death in the movie. The 'villains' keep going out of their way to save the protagonists' lives, while the 'heroes' continue to heckle and sabotage them. While a Tyrannosaurus is rampaging through the hunter group, the leader suddenly finds out that one of the heroes stole the bullets from his gun.
</li><li> The film also falls headfirst into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">Strawman Has a Point</a>. The antagonists are supposed to be evil because they claim that the dinosaurs were property of the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>, when <em>that's exactly what they are</em>; they wouldn't even exist if they hadn't been deliberately created, which also nicely shatters the protagonists' argument that they should be left alone to live naturally, nature having nothing to do with it. A clear example of the "villains" being more like jerks than actually evil.
</li></ul></li><li> Caroline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaidInManhattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaidInManhattan">Maid in Manhattan</a></em>, one of the two "wicked stepsisters" in this modern-day version of <em>Cinderella</em>. She's a flake and utterly oblivious to the fact that the "Prince" is completely uninterested in her, but other than that, she doesn't do anything wrong. The one remotely bad thing that she does is file a complaint when she discovers that Marisa (the titular maid) has been wearing her clothes and pretending to be her—a perfectly legitimate gripe.
</li><li> Dr. Jarret in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MansBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MansBestFriend">Man's Best Friend</a></em> is an interesting case of this. He is performing unethical and illegal research on animals (bad) and he created the genetically engineered killer dog that causes all the trouble in the movie (also bad, but keep reading). His purpose was to build the ultimate guard dog after his wife and child were killed; he figured it would be a good product to sell. He also kept Max on a strict regiment of drugs designed to keep him from going berserk and insane. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> steals Max from the laboratory, the police and others don't seem too interested in taking Dr. Jarret seriously, despite the fact that he has explained that his dog is a ticking time-bomb that's ready to explode in a shower of mayhem...He made the monster, but he kept it under control, and it was only due to the acts of others that it escaped and was able to kill people. And we're supposed to believe that he's bad.
</li><li> The disaster film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Meteor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Meteor">Meteor</a></em> had an American general be portrayed in a bad light for objecting to Russians getting access to a top secret American command center during the height of the Cold War. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawManHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawManHasAPoint">Straw Man Has A Point</a>.
</li><li> Rail Chief Patterson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyTrain">Money Train</a></em> is the bad guy for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">terrible</a> crime of not wanting his trains robbed by the protagonists. Granted, he's not exactly likable, being a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">greedy</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, but when the "good guys" are motivated by paying off gambling debts, (and one of the was semi-seriously planning the heist when paying off the debt was not nearly as much of an issue as it later became) it's hard to say they're any better when it comes to greed, at least. Patterson does go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> by endangering the lives of innocents as part of his attempt to stop the robbery, but that's also something which movies tend to shrug off or ignore when, say, a main character who's a detective or action hero does it.

Adams's nonconformity includes practicing medicine without a license, stealing from a hospital, and ignoring background history. The audience is expected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">side with Adams on all issues</a>, but most audiences think that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">Strawman Has a Point</a>. Adams' roommate is treated as a villain who needs to change because he's annoyed by Adams and thinks that he cheats on his exams. However, the character is simply an earnest medical student who has good reason to be suspicious of Adams' flawless grades, given the fact that we never see him study. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Patch Adams, who behaves nothing like his fictional counterpart, hates the movie and sides with the "villains."

He doesn't even kill anyone or actively seek any sort of retribution (which many viewers would likely actually see as justified) against the evil man who was the cause of all his suffering, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Lord Ambrose d'Arcy</a>.

He doesn't tell the racers he and a bunch of other millionaires are betting on them, and some of the bets they do make come off as kind of callous, but he's otherwise totally upfront about the conditions of the race, he's polite to the racers, doesn't sabotage or impede them in any way, really does have a cash prize waiting for them, and isn't directly responsible for any of the problems the racers run into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including not getting the money</span>.

</li><li> The A.I. from the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> movie. It was <em>supposed</em> to be seen as wrong for insisting that the main characters kill one of their own who was infected before the A.I. would let them leave and for killing everyone in the facility when the virus was released. The problem with this? <em>It was the only one doing its job</em>. Everyone else was too busy trying to force their way in and then out, short circuiting the A.I. or sending in more and more people into what should be a building under total quarantine. If they had just let the A.I. do its job they wouldn't be dealing with a world wide zombie apocalypse two movies later. The Red Queen becomes much more antagonistic during her return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilRetribution">Resident Evil: Retribution</a></em>, in which she's running a facility cloning Alice and several of the movie series characters by the hundreds and killing them over and over again in order to try and control Umbrella's viruses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchoolOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchoolOfRock">School of Rock</a></em> depicts Ned's girlfriend Patty as being pushy and hypocritical because she "forces" him to demand Dewey actually get a job and pay his <em>massive</em> rent debt. Even though this is a rather reasonable demand, since Dewey isn't terribly concerned with what a drag he is on Ned. She is also supposed to be seen as hypocritical by pointing out that Dewey steps all over him and manipulates him...even though he does <em>exactly that</em> to Ned, to the point of engaging in identity theft to get a job under his name and trying to beg that he not do anything about it when Ned finds out. She's later further villainized for convincing Ned to press charges over the identity theft. At no point in the film is Dewey ever truly sorry for what he pulls on Ned and how many laws he broke or even that what he did could seriously impact Ned's own career as a teacher. For starters, the income from the job that Ned technically lost out on since Dewey took it from him, or what would happen when Ned didn't declare income from a job unknowingly taken under his name on his taxes. Dewey <em>does</em> acknowledge that what he did to the kids was wrong, but he's not ever aware of how much he took advantage of his roommate either. The moment where Ned breaks up with Patty for Dewey's concert is supposed to be a triumph of assertiveness when her only crime is being kind of aggressive over Ned not ever standing up for himself and being taken advantage of.
</li><li> The Gorgonites in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers">Small Soldiers</a></em> is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. The Gorgonites were originally meant for an environmental-friendly toyline, but it was cancelled and folded into the Commando Elite as the bad guys. However, their creator was angry at that and, instead of turning the Gorgonites into the enemy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">their friendly nature was left in</a>. Thus, the supposed-to-be heroic Commando Elite turn into genocidal monsters because they are "the good guys" and the Gorgonites are "the bad guys".
</li><li> Most of the men in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmokers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmokers">The Smokers</a></em> are this, particularly David. He's considered bad because he's hot and cold towards Lisa, despite the fact that he knew her for less then an hour before they had sex and that Lisa never hinted that she'd like to go out with him instead of just having a one-night stand. Hell, he isn't even depicted as being a jerkass for most of the movie, but not only does the film tell us we're supposed to hate him, it expects us to laugh when he's being raped and tortured by our "heroes".
</li><li> In the Nickelodeon flick <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowDay">Snow Day</a></em>; the "villain" is simply the town snowplow driver, referred to exclusively as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Snowplow Man</a>". It's more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, as obviously, from the perspective of a kid, the guy who clears away the snow and enables more school days after a blizzard is a heinous villain, even though this is obviously not the sole consequence for clearing away the snow. Then we actually see the guy in action and it turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight">The Cuckoolander Was Right</a>, and he does take pleasure in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">sending the kids back to school</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.

Seriously, all the "mutineers" wanted was just to <em>go home</em> instead of being forced to spend the rest of their lives on a derelict spaceship just because of some ridiculous, bullshit law the ship's captain made decades ago. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kalgan</a> doesn't even start using underhanded tactics until <em>after</em> Ryder starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">slaughtering his men unprovoked</a>. This is doubly egregious since the opening blurb about the <em>colony ship</em> is that they're looking for a new planet to settle. The mutineers have <em>found</em> a planet to settle and are going to fulfill the ship's mission by settling there. A scene cut from the better known Mystery Science Theater version establishes that their leaders are planning to sell the ship's crew into slavery, with the rank and file being duped into it.

Most of the movie involves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">jerkass protagonist</a> and her friends trying to torture and murder her because she accused the protagonist of cheating when she had every reason to believe that the protagonist had, in fact, been cheating. The movie also heavily implies that Trudy, the protagonist's competitor for the stipendium, deserves to be killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">merely for being studious</a>.

How's <em>he</em> supposed to know that it's really magic at work that will keep them safe? The man, Mr. Conroy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">is crushed to find that the magic was real and he missed the chance to be young again</a> (but right at the end, Mr. Bloom promises us that he'll get the magic after all).

<ul><li> Jonas and his "evil, tornado-chaser crew". Jonas used to be a "pure" tornado chaser, then he got corporate sponsors and a fleet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">black</a> SUVs. He also has a duplicate of the main characters' "Dorothy" system, which he rightly claims credit for building. Bill (a guy who had given up tornado chasing to get a job as a TV weatherman) even assaults Jonas while he's talking to reporters, and gets angry when Jonas snidely asks how his new gig is going. This motivates Bill to abandon his fiancee and team up with his ex-wife and her crew. Bill also looks down on Jonas because he relies on technology and not instinct in order to predict tornadoes. So, if you can't sense the weather like Bill, you're a fraud, because, apparently, the whole point of tornado chasing isn't scientific research... And at the end, Jonas gets killed by a tornado. Um...yay?
</li><li> This is made even worse because Bill and Jonas <em>have the exact same goal</em> - using the Dorothy system to gain valuable scientific data that could lead to better tornado warning systems that could save lives. Not only that, Jonas does not once use evil means to achieve these ends. There's no difference between Bill and Jonas ... except that Jonas is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">a bit mean to Bill, whereas Bill is actively violent and abusive to Jonas</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnaccompaniedMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnaccompaniedMinors">Unaccompanied Minors</a></em>, the bad guy is the airport security director. He's upset that he can't go on vacation because the whole airport is snowed in. The protagonists are all kept away in a children's area, but the main characters break out, and proceed to steal food, steal a transport, and go to the mileage club without being accompanied by an adult. He confines them to the airport room while the rest of the kids are taken to an inn. For the rest of the film, they break out, steal from the unclaimed baggage, and try to get to that inn where one of the character's sister is. The director's just doing his job in trying to get them back. He proceeds to fall over a slop, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">crash a canoe</a>, and an annoyed guest assaults him, along with the girl who stole the car! At the end of the film this is addressed, as he just tells the main kid that he's just doing his job. However, the movie still treats him as a scrooge for being bitter on Christmas, and it's he who learns the lesson about giving, while the protagonists don't get called on their actions.
</li><li> Davey Bunting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em>. He's a good-natured cowboy who never hurts anyone in the film, and when his partner Quick Mike (who definitely IS evil) maims Delilah, Davey tries to compensate her by giving her a pony. But because he's partnered with Quick Mike, his offer is rejected with rocks and sticks, a bounty is placed on his head along with Quick Mike, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is brutally killed by Will Munny, the main protagonist.</span>
</li><li> Laura Barnes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unfriended" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unfriended">Unfriended</a></em>. The entire movie is about her coming back from the dead as a ghost to torment and kill her former classmates via Skype because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they drove her to suicide via, not only an embarrassing video they filmed of her passed out drunk after a party, but also by cyberbullying her through anonymous videos and harsh Facebook posts telling her to kill herself.

</li><li> Walt Ferris, the inspector, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeBoughtAZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeBoughtAZoo">We Bought a Zoo</a></em>. The most 'evil' thing he does is give a surprise, unofficial inspection a few weeks early... allowing the family to fix the problems he points out, so they can pass the REAL inspection (he also warns them of an impending regulation change, something he didn't really have to do; they treat this as a dick move, for some reason, as if he's the one changing the regulation). He is stated to have stolen some of their innovations for himself, but there's no actual evidence of that. In fact, he acts downright civil towards his supposed enemy, as long as the latter doesn't try to kill him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizard">The Wizard</a></em> has two villains: one is a true villain type - a jerk kid (Lucas) who goes against the heroes in the big video game contest; the other is a guy (Putnam) who tracks down runaway kids for a living, but everyone accuses him of somehow exploiting the kids. Given that he has an attitude and uses tactics more befitting of a child abductor than a professional private detective, there could be some off-screen truth to it. He also actively tries to prevent Sam (the two boys' <em>father</em>) from finding them first just so he can collect the reward. At one point, he slashes the man's tires. Certainly doesn't justify all of Sam's interactions with him (such as trying to run him over later), but Putnam was hardly just some well-meaning authority figure caught up in a misunderstanding. The guy could actually be considered an in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>.

This is before they've done anything. Lessingham dryly concludes that "A fiery politician is my martlet", and resolves to make up his own mind on things. He and the martlet are never referred to again. As it turns out, the villains aren't much different from the heroes and certainly don't deserve titles like "the children of night everlasting". This is an odd example because the author seems to quite like them.

The ogre in question is the grumpy stepfather of three of the main characters. One of the first things he does is the book is buy two of the kids chemistry sets as presents, but the kids are determined to treat him as a bad guy. As the book progresses, he gets increasingly angry and punishes the kids for messing up the house, getting in trouble, making a lot of noise, and ruining a party he was throwing.

We're told that they're a corrupt government with no respect for human life who want to take out the Cullens for selfish reasons (kidnapping Alice and Edward), but they're the only vampires that make any active attempt to control their species, follow their own laws, and keep vampires from senselessly slaughtering humans. Even though their primary motive is self-preservation, they still do more to protect both their own species and humans than the designated protagonists, the Cullens.
</li><li> Laurent. He's reasonable and even warns the Cullens about James and his ability. In <em>New Moon</em> he's revealed to have been trying to be a 'vegetarian' but since Bella has an irresistible scent he can't help himself and tries to eat her. He's subsequently killed by the werewolves. The narrative paints him as evil, but other people-eating vampires (such as the dozens introduced in <em>Breaking Dawn</em>) are not treated as such, despite eating just as many people and most of whom don't even consider becoming vegetarians.
</li><li> Leah. The characters and narrative treat her as a bitter, shrill harpy who gets in everyone's way. But Leah has had arguably one of the worst lives of the Pack, is fiercely loyal to her tribe/Jacob, and manages to get over the myriad of ways that life has screwed her to do her job as a shifter.

Kayla's crime, really, is hooking up with Heath after Zoey tells her several times, in no uncertain terms, that she's broken up with him. In <em>Betrayed</em>, Zoey acts like Kayla was being horribly spiteful and irrational in going to the police after witnessing Zoey drinking Heath's blood, and then having Zoey threaten to do the same to her. To really hammer this point in, Zoey's friends (who never even met Kayla before) begin referring to her as "skank-bitch Kayla" after learning that she went to the police.

The narrative makes it clear that he effectively brainwashes the woodsman and makes him give up his old job to be a companion. Yet when the "beasts" charge in for revenge, the same narrative says they have "some evil design". After the woodsman chases them off, the musician releases him from servitude, which is played off as a gesture of kindness and gratitude... even though he enslaved him in the first place.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenTraviss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenTraviss">Karen Traviss</a> seems determined to do this to Dr. Catherine Halsey in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> novels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands">Glasslands</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar">The Thursday War</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata">Mortal Dictata</a></em> (prequels to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>), putting the blame for the SPARTAN-II program's shadier aspects (primarily the kidnapping of six-year-old children) squarely on Halsey's shoulders. Almost everyone suddenly starts seeing Halsey as a monster who shouldn't be allowed to live. The specific act that earns the hate is the flash-cloning of the kidnapped children in order to convince the parents that the kids aren't really missing. The clones fall ill, with most dying a few months later. The head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">ONI</a>, Admiral Margaret Parangosky, personally blames Halsey for this. The kicker is, nothing happens in ONI without Parangosky's say-so, so there's no way she could not have known about the flash-cloning beforehand, especially since it hardly could have been accomplished by Halsey alone (indeed, previous sources implied that the flash-cloning was done with ONI's full approval). Nobody seems to consider that making parents think their kids are dead may be more <em>merciful</em> than living with the constant fear that their child was kidnapped (and additionally, Traviss even conveniently forgets that the flash-cloning was done precisely to stop people from asking further questions). Another argument is that the SPARTAN-II program was started many years before the war with the Covenant, so there's no justification for it. However, the Insurrectionists who plagued UNSC for years did so using terrorist tactics far beyond anything we've seen so far in real life, like using suicide bombers armed with <em>nukes</em> (the Insurrectionist nuking of the Haven arcology, mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halsey's own journal</a>, killed <em>two million</em> civilians and injured 8.3 million more). While Halsey's actions may be seen as deplorable, there were reasons why she took them, and it's fairly clear that the moral culpability rests on ONI as a whole (which, to its credit, <em>Mortal Dictata</em> does touch a tiny bit on). Worse, the author shows no sympathy for Halsey, even when it's revealed that she cries herself to sleep every night with the name of her dead daughter (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miranda Keyes</span>) on her lips.
<ul><li> In addition, the SPARTAN-III program (using orphans from glassed planets) is presented as the better alternative, as the orphans agreed to take part in it. However, the SPARTAN-III program were meant to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a>, most of whom end up dying in combat by the age of <em>twelve</em>. Since all those orphans were also recruited as children (many of them at ages even <em>younger</em> than the IIs), they're obviously not mature enough to make the decision to agree.
</li><li> Much of the fandom's issue with Traviss's presentation isn't so much that she points out that the Spartan-II program was ethically dodgy at best (obviously), but that she even ignores prior canon to make Halsey look worse; for one thing, claiming that Halsey lied to the children about why they were taken, when prior sources showed that she specifically said that ONI should <em>not</em> lie to the children about the reasons behind their kidnapping.

Granted, she <em>does</em> have a point about an army of cloned, 10-year-old cannon fodder being led by 13-year old commanders, with both Jedi and Clone Troopers trained as emotionally detached killers with no messy "attachments" from infancy, and a Republic that sees no problem with this being <em>very</em> dodgy with ethics at best and no better than what they're fighting at worst — but she also seems to present them as <em>better</em> than the beloved Mandalorians, who do at bare minimum every single thing that the Jedi are accused of, often worse.

It is not until recently, that more and more people have started to question this and wonder if she really <em>was</em> that bad. She grew up as a princess of Tyre, one of the cities of Ancient Phoenicia (present-day Lebanon), and is devoted to the old pagan religion of her home country, even after she becomes the queen of Israel. And she also supposedly made her husband, King Ahab, join her in the worship of her pantheon, mainly Baal. And that is clearly reason enough for the narrator to hate her from the start and portray her as evil. It is true that Jezebel <em>is</em> accused of doing a thing or two, which will sound terrible even to a modern secular audience. But the narrator's wrath over Jezebel's persecution of Jahve's prophets is very hypocritical, when he later applauds acts of gory violence from Jezebel's two main opponents, Elijah and Jehu, because those guys belonged to <em>his</em> religion. Even when Jezebel decides to frame the innocent Naboth and has him executed because he wouldn't sell his vineyard to King Ahab... Well, that is probably her way of making sure that her subjects would see that her husband was in charge. And even though that still sounds harsh to modern ears, it would have been totally understandable in her culture back in Ancient Phoenicia. Also, King Ahab (who is portrayed as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">Henpecked Husband</a>, but still) seems to never inform his wife that her actions are against the law of Moses. So she would have no reason to feel that she did anything wrong, because Ahab would never stop her or even reprimand her afterwards. And lastly, Jezebel's death is enough to make anybody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic">Unintentionally Sympathetic</a>: she is thrown out of a window by her own courtiers, and her body gets crushed and eaten by dogs until she can't even get a proper funeral.

Medusa is a particularly prominent example to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">modern observers</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">one version</a> has her turned into a monster by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Athena</a> for <em>being raped in the wrong place</em> by a far more powerful being (in this case the god <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Poseidon</a>, generally considered to be an okay guy). The reason for this is that being classical mythology, they are using the <em>original</em> definition of "Hero", which is very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>: someone who does great things in the name of the Gods.

</li><li> Loki and his children in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> are designated villains for taking part in the doom of the gods, despite the gods being somewhat morally ambiguous figures anyway (although Loki definitely has some of their dodgier behavior on his hands too). However, Jörmungandr is alone among the children of Loki in being treated this way before the Ragnarök. Odin tried to drown him for... well, being a snake. Hel was put in charge of Hel and given control over 9 realms. Sure, she was separated from her family and was not allowed to live among the other gods but she was given an important job.

Contrarily, Becky was one of the most beloved women wrestlers in the company and the fan had been cheering for her for years, even more after attacking Charlotte, no less due to Charlotte's role as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> who the fans had been tired of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>-like push over the last three years.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DinoAttackRPG">Dino Attack RPG</a></em>, Plastic Serpent was intended to come off as seeming like a low-life criminal scumbag who deserved to get repeatedly beaten up by Snake. The trouble was that Snake himself ended up coming off as <em>also</em> being a low-life criminal scumbag who acted like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to everyone and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">ditched the team to save his own skin</a>. In the first encounter, Plastic Serpent was simply getting a bite to eat when Snake began viciously beating him up (it was implied that he <em>had</em> stolen Snake's codename at the time, "Plastic Serpent"- as he originally operated under the name of "Snake" but changed it as a result of this encounter).
<ul><li> In the second encounter, Snake had to go and beat him up while <em>he was already wounded in battle</em>. An attempt to justify this was made by throwing in off-hand references to Plastic Serpent supposedly screwing Snake over, but many players found given Snake's character up to this point combined with the fact that none of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffstageVillainy">Offstage Villainy</a> actually appeared brought the reliability of Snake's comments into question.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">non-canon</a> scene was also written (mainly as a joke in response to certain comments) in which a <em>third</em> beatdown happened. This time Plastic Serpent was just minding his own business when Snake started violently bashing his head into the rails of a bridge. Admittedly this time Snake <em>did</em> get what was coming to him (albeit after Plastic Serpent had his head bashed in several times and got thrown into the river below where he may have drowned) when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork">Snake Plissken</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Solid Snake</a> themselves show up and get back at him. Of course Snake receives a comparatively lighter beatdown and then Plissken went ahead and did to Solid Snake the same thing that had been done to Plastic Serpent</span>.
</li><li> Admittedly, the fact that the entire thing was meant to be an allegory for what turned out to be a <em>massive</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a> on Atton Rand's part didn't help.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Ventrue are the de facto Designated Villains, although that isn't fair, as <em>all</em> vampires are villainous despite their best efforts. The Daeva, who have the explicit weakness <em>of</em> inevitable moral decline have far more reasons to actually <em>be</em> the Designated Villains, only the fluff of the manuals and supplements just don't write them that way. The Daeva are sympathetic, as being evil is not really their fault, they're just morally decadent. The Ventrue, however, are always portrayed, every last vampire jack of them, as conniving, cackling, sadistic, and <em>evil</em> sons of bitches who are evil because that's what the Ventrue are and do.
</li><li> As far as fluff goes, the Nosferatu and Gangrel tend to get Designated Hero slots, but if an NPC in a supplement is marked "Ventrue Invictus", you can guarantee that the character is going to be portrayed in a villainous light.
</li><li> Mekhet, however, are the Designated Morally Ambivalent. They might as well be Vulcans for all the White Wolf writing staff cares.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BeastThePrimordial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BeastThePrimordial">Beast: The Primordial</a></em>, the titular Beasts are trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality">living story</a> in which they have been made to assume the role of living nightmares, incarnations of the fears spawned by the unknown and slapped with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> that compels them to hurt and torment people both for survival and to fill their cosmic role. Being well-aware of their role breeds a certain level of antipathy in Beasts, especially towards Heroes who A: get the "cushy job" as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>, B: never <em>try</em> to fight their narrative role the way many Beasts choose to, and C: that "cushy job" is "track down and murder Beasts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">without question or compromise</a>. Little wonder the "Good End" for Beasts is the Apex path, where they successfully subvert their overarching narrative and rewrite it to make <em>themselves</em> into the protagonist.
</li><li> Similarly, the Technocracy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> are largely Designated Villains, by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> standards, given that there are expansion books to play technocrats and the core books note that the rivalry is somewhat one-sided, with the technocracy not so much hunting you down as reacting with vague surprise that you're still around when you bust into their laboratory.
<ul><li> Later books softened them up a lot. While they <em>are</em> crushing human creativity and enforcing reality to abide by their standards, this is actually done in order to prevent all sorts of monsters and other horrible things creeping into the world, while giving the average person access to 'magic', as technology is magic that anyone can study and use. At worst, they could be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> wasn't named on a whim. Like every other playable faction, the Mages are legitimate dangers to the free will and physical welfare of mortals (the majority of sentient beings) in their own right. Every sourcebook got an antagonist faction that was outright stated to be the designated villain _because it holds the interests of humanity above other things_. Most human corporations in Werewolf are actually reasonable enough, the technocracy brought on the enlightenment, and the various vampire-hunting organizations aren't exactly unreasonable in their desire to hunt and slay creatures that have to kill humans with some frequency to survive.
<ul><li> All that said, the 'villainous' parts also hold true for all the antagonist factions. The Technocracy brought on the Enlightenment, but back then they were the Order of Reason and <em>they</em> were the rebels against the stifling status quo of Hermetic traditionalism and Christian fundamentalism. Over time, as befits the darkness of the WoD, they became the villains, crushing the world in their grip in their goal to keep humanity 'safe', but only on their terms. Similarly, the Wyrm is a very real evil force with no current redeeming qualities and anti-Vampire hunters rarely distinguish between a Sabbat Tzimisce who likes to decorate his living room with the skins of his still-alive ghouls and the Anarch Toreador who only feeds from willing supplicants and never kills. It's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a> with ample degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>. <em>No one</em> is unequivocally a good guy in the WoD.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>. Since Claudius killed Hamlet's father all by himself, he'd have no reason to confide in R&amp;G or anyone else about it. So R&amp;G might not have seen anything vile about obeying his summons to check out their old friend, Hamlet, and see if they can find out what's wrong with him. When Claudius sends R&amp;G to England with Hamlet, he gives them a sealed envelope for the English which orders Hamlet's immediate execution. Since these orders are sealed, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">there's nothing to indicate R&amp;G knew what those sealed orders were.</a></em> Yet when Hamlet breaks into their cabin and opens the seal and reads the order, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">he changes the order making it for R&amp;G's immediate executions.</a> Since Hamlet gets kidnapped by pirates on the way to England, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">R&amp;G would have no reason to deliver those sealed orders if they already knew what those orders originally were</a>.
</li><li> Another played-with Shakespearean example comes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em> with Goneril and Regan, Lear's elder two daughters. They're portrayed as villains because they lie to their father about how much they love him and later tell him that he has to send away some of his retinue of knights if he's going to stay with them. While it's true that they did exaggerate about their affection for Lear, they were doing so <em>because he wanted them to</em> — he was quite literally deciding how much of his kingdom they would get based on their answers, and Cordelia, who does genuinely love him, ends up being banished forever because she wouldn't kiss up to him. Furthermore, Lear acts like a completely spoiled brat while he stays with Goneril and Regan, hunting and living it up all day, then coming home (with <em>a hundred men</em>) and demanding to be waited on hand and foot while he and his knights carouse all evening—completely ignoring the fact that the princesses are trying to run the kingdom he left them. Granted, Goneril and Regan are far from saints, but they often seem more sympathetic and frustrated than evil.
<ul><li> They do show unambiguously villainous colours, however, in fully condoning Cornwall's blinding of Gloucester.
</li></ul></li><li> The ultimate Shakespeare example might be Shylock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>. His name has become a slur synonymous with villainy, and the phrase "pound of flesh" has come to refer to anything given unfairly—but the thing of it is, within the play, Shylock <em>didn't do anything wrong.</em> The contract that he and Antonio form is honest and legally binding; there's no coercion involved. Of course, Shylock could have taken the other characters' offer to buy out the contract for double its worth, but that doesn't make his insistence on sticking to the bond illegal. So why is he such a villain? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Because he's Jewish</a>, and when the play was written, Christianity was the dominant religion of England. That fact even explains his less-than-clear thinking on the matter: his only daughter elopes with a Christian man and converts to do so, leaving him without any descendants whatsoever. His insistence on clinging to the contract seems less like a villain scheming to hurt people and more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">a broken, scared man desperately clutching at some semblance of order to keep himself sane.</a> Virtually every contemporary production of <em>Venice</em> addresses this problem, and tries to find a way to reconcile the intense antisemitism of Shakespeare's time with more tolerant/open values.
</li><li> The Duke of Castile in Kyd's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSpanishTragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSpanishTragedy">The Spanish Tragedy</a></em>. He's a rather oppressive father to Bel-imperia but otherwise not a bad guy, and actually tries to investigate and mitigate his son's villainy, but he is still eternally punished along with the villains of the story in the final scene.
</li><li> Dick Deadeye in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HMSPinafore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HMSPinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></em> is roundly hated and vilified by all his shipmates, mainly for being ugly. "From such a face and form as mine the noblest sentiments sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination." This certainly applies to the blandest sentiments, e.g., Dick: "Ah, it's a queer world!" Ralph: "Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you, but such a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor shudder." And when leading man Ralph, a foremast hand, in response to Sir Joseph's foolish claim that a British seaman is any man's equal (except his own), is deciding to propose to ingenue Josephine, his captain's daughter, Dick's voice of sanity—"When people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question"—is roundly rejected by his messmates. On the other hand, when in Act II Dick has warned his captain of "the wicked men who['ll] art employ/to make his Josephine less coy", no retribution lands on Dick after the surprise ending that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unites the hero and heroine after all</span>. Perhaps everyone simply expects such behavior from "poor Dick Deadeye", the Designated Villain.

The reigning Baronet, Sir Despard Murgatroyd, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a>, who gets his daily crime over early in the day and does good afterwards.

</li><li> It happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Fools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Fools">Fools</a></em>. Count Yousekevitch is set up to be the villain by the other characters and is presented in a ridiculous "bad guy" outfit. His only real crime is trying to marry a pretty girl. Later, he even lampshades this. He then seemingly has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">only to turn it into a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">and prove himself to be just as bad as everyone else said.</a>

It's clear that the authors meant her to be sympathetic, though, and over the years they've repeatedly revised her part to make her more so.
</li><li> Magnificent in Ibsen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse">A Doll's House</a></em> with Nils Krogstad, who is repeatedly demonized as an unpleasant and weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">dog kicker</a>, but is, upon closer inspection, just trying to secure his job so he can feed his children, and is eventually talked into a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. There is no <em>real</em> villain, apart perhaps from how Torvald and Nora have turned their marriage into a dysfunctional delusion where he doesn't take her seriously as a human being and she believes he'd keep supporting her even if she were to reveal her 'true' self.
</li><li> The Giantess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>. Her only real crime is not being human. She treated Jack kindly and protected him from her husband, and, in return, he robs her and kills her husband. If she was a human, Jack (who admits that he did it) would have been hauled off to jail, if not the chopping block. All the deaths in the second half are either accidents (because she can't see without her glasses) or caused by humans. There is even a scene in the second act deconstructing this, and discussing why she deserves to live less than Jack does. Eventually, the heroes recognize that her grief is as valid as theirs — but they still have to take her down, because she'll destroy the kingdom otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em>: subverted by Colonel De Guiche <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>.

For 90% of the play, John Dickinson appears to be a hidebound aristocrat whose primary concern about independence is that it will upset his comfortable, upper-class status quo, combined with a total aversion to risk and continued loyalty to England. It also attributes to Jefferson words actually written by Dickinson (the passage from <em>On the Necessity For Taking Up Arms</em>; the two men co-wrote it). It is remedied in the last scene, though, by giving Dickinson a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> sendoff where he proves that his desire for reconciliation really <em>is</em> the completely reasonable fear that the colonies will be crushed for rebelling and resigns from Congress to join the army.

In the musical, the only thing she did wrong was be rich, disliked by the children (and even then, only in comparison to Maria), and choosing not to cause any trouble with Germany to save their heads. She was made a little cattier in the movie, but really at worst she was just preventing Maria from moving in on her fiance. And then there's the live Carrie Underwood show, where, thanks to a virtuoso performance by Laura Benanti, many viewers were rooting for her over Maria!

</li><li> M also plays the trope straight. The reason Sly goes up against him is to get his hands on a huge amount of gold and treasure that M is trying to steal. Sly claims the treasure belongs to him since it was amassed by Sly's ancestors. The problem with that claim is that nearly all of the treasure was obtained through theft, so Sly has just as much right to it as M does - which is to say none at all. Even Sly's claim that he's entitled to it because it belonged to his father is contestable as Dr. M was his father's <em>teammate</em> and thus has some stake in the treasure as he helped the father earn it to begin with.
</li><li> And just to make things even more complicated, while Dr. M's primary goals and motivations are, as stated above, neutral-to-legitimate, he's still clearly a villain, considering he poisoned one of his lackeys (who he knows full well has a wife and son) for incompetence, attempted to murder an Interpol agent, and continued to attack even as Sly tried to retreat.

</li><li> While this is debatable, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>, the NOL is straddling this line. For the most part, the organization is filled with lots and lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch Clock Villains</a>, who were doing their jobs for their paycheck, and they truly believed in their goal in creating a peaceful world free of conflicts. However, because Ragna mainly opposes them and they employ several villains like Hazama and Relius, combined with the fact that they are mainly composed of rich people and make up some dictatorship rule (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">even if it's for preventing total chaos</a>), it becomes easy to paint them as a tyrannical group of villains or a merciless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Empire</a> type organization.

In fact, the game runs on this. No matter who you play as, the other 2 kingdoms (and minor forces) tend to be painted as the bad guys - which makes sense since they're trying to unite China under their rule too, so it's a conflict of interest. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">exceptions</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Dong Zhuo</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Lu Bu</a>.
<ul><li> Though in recent games, and <em>especially</em> the eight one, Cao Cao is being treated more as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>. Some theorize this is a reaction to Wei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">popularity in the West</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em>. During the search for Amelia, you run into Rodger and then run into a bandit leader. He was willing to ignore you and go about his way, but the party members kept saying he looked 'evil'. The only reason you fight him is because they wouldn't stop saying that and the bandit snapped.
</li></ul><ul><li> Simply going by what the players see, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">UED</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft</a>: Brood War</em> turn into this. They don't come off as particularly evil when you're playing as them in the Terran campaign, and many players were glad that you force Mengsk off his throne playing as them. Yet in the Zerg campaign you find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Jim Raynor</a>, who loathes Mengsk with passion, and the Protoss, who the UED barely have any contact with, helping Kerrigan try push them out when she ultimately proves to be the worse of two evils.
<ul><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">backstory</a>, where the United Powers League (the precursor to the United Earth Directorate) conducts racial cleansing of all Earth citizens, including cyborgs, mutants (including those with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>), and other undesirable elements. The original idea is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">put them in camps and kill them</a>. A scientist suggests using them to colonize a far-away planet, so tens of thousands of them are forcibly placed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryo-pods</a> and sent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperStarship">Sleeper Starships</a> to that planet. The navigation system malfunctions and they end up spending decades in warp, ending up in the Koprulu sector. Throughout the struggles of the "colonists", the UPL continues to keep track of them and incorporating some of their technological breakthroughs. After the discovery of the Zerg, the UPL is reorganized into the UED, which sends a fleet to take control of the situation. In this light, it's difficult to see them as anything but villains; assuming, of course, that the UED didn't politically reform at some point, which is entirely possible, as neither of the UED's top officers seemed bothered by the presence of 'undesirables'.
</li><li> In the opening cutscene of <em>Brood War</em>, the UED fleet is first seen observing the Zerg overrunning a colony, and it's heavily implied by Gerrard's line about "unleashing them upon men" that the UED is responsible for the attack. When it's clear that the colony is doomed unless help arrives, the fleet...simply leaves. That's pretty villainous behavior. It doesn't make the Dominion the good guys, especially since Mengsk did the exact same thing to his enemies. It's more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Albion Prelude</a></em>, the Terrans are evil for demanding justice for a terrorist committing an act of <em>genocide</em> that appears at first to be conducted purely out of racism. To be more specific, as far as you can tell in the game, the cause of the Second Terraformer War between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetTerra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetTerra">Terrans</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Argon Federation</a> is that Saya Kho suicide-bombed the Torus Aeternal (massive space station ringing Earth's equator) for little reason, an act that killed thousands of Terran civilians and military personnel instantly, then millions more from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">deorbiting debris</a>. <br/><br/>In a rather extreme case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>, the war started because the Terran intelligence services were infiltrating the Community of Planets with the hope of influencing its future course, due largely to the Terrans' paranoia about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">artificial general intelligence</a>. This ended up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>: the Argon began working on AGI combat vessels in order to give their military a fighting chance against the Terrans' technological superiority, then used them to invade the Solar System in a preemptive strike when they discovered the Terrans' spy network. Saya Kho infiltrated Sol as an agent of the Argon Secret Service; her attack on the Torus was intended to open the way for an Argon invasion of Earth. So, while a little more nuanced than it originally appears, there's still the fact that the Argon struck first.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em>'s Carter Blake is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a> who has no business being on the force, calling him "psychopathic", as Jayden does, is a tad extreme. He at least seems to <em>mean</em> well ("The only thing I'm interested in is saving that kid's life!"), and the conclusions he comes to aren't unreasonable. But, ends don't justify means.

Really, they're just doing what they're supposed to do, and their erasing of players is actually important to keeping the universe in balance and humanity constantly evolving based on what we learn in secret reports. Also, while Minamimoto and Konishi are obviously villains, Yodai was simply doing his job and Kitaniji <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was trying to save the UG from complete destruction with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a>, although Neku and the player don't learn this until after Kitaniji has lost</span>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since this is the view of the protagonists whom the Reapers are erasing. From their view, the Reapers are just predators and they want to survive.
</li></ul></li><li> The Enclave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> can come across this way, especially to people unfamiliar with them from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. True, they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hijack Project Purity</span> and their leader's plan is pretty horrific when you learn of it. But the subordinates of the Enclave seem more level headed in comparison and more interested in governing the Wasteland rather than destroying it. And considering the Wasteland is a pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">horrible place to live</a> what with the wandering gangs, super mutants, and poor living conditions, and they have by far the most advanced technology available to enforce order albeit with brutal tactics, the player may find himself wishing there was an option to side with them rather than treating them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. It gets even more clear if you foil President Eden's plot, at which point the Enclave's plan is simply to turn on the water purifier - something everyone wants to do anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> gives us Canach as the villain in the <em>Secret of Southsun</em> and <em>Last Stand at Southsun</em> arcs. After accidentally inciting some monsters to attack a major city, Canach is arrested, but claims to be a protector of the weak. He eventually disappears in order to sabotage the Consortium he used to work for. The player is ultimately tasked to stop him, which they do. The only problem is, long before you defeat him, you learn that the refugees that had settled the island had been tricked into virtual slavery thanks to the Consortium's contracts and Canach's goal was to end this injustice. Canach only fought the heroes in self-defense when they came after him, and the authorities had been refusing to help the settlers until Canach forced their hand. Ultimately, you fulfill his plan by destroying the odious contracts, but the game still acts like locking Canach up and throwing away the key is a just outcome. Why he was wrong and the heroes were right is never adequately explained.
<ul><li> The Ascalonian humans suffer a strange form of this retroactively. In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> campaign, you played an Ascalonian forced out of their homeland by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> Charr. In order to make the Charr playable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, Arena.net took steps to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> nature, partially by attempting to reframe the war as not a defensive one on the human's part, but a rightful reclamation of land on the Charr's part. In an attempt to make it more ambiguous, a new event was added to the lore after the player's left Ascalon, where the king who remained behind, surrounded by enemies, activated an ancient spell that succeeded in destroying the nearby Charr... but also cursed him and his people to forever wander as ghosts who still think they're fighting the war. This is treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> for the king and, by extension, the Ascalonians, by humans and Charr alike in the present. There are still two problems with this, however. First, that the king had no idea that would happen. Second, that from what we saw in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, there was no indication that the humans knew the land used to be owned by the Charr, and the Charr's response was not diplomacy, but casting an apocalyptic spell that reduced the entire region to a barren wasteland for <em>at least</em> 250 years. Not only that, but the Charr who led the attack were from a faction that is recognized as evil to this day. Despite this, the Charr are treated as being completely justified for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">hating humans</a> and it's treated as something humans should learn to put up with, while bitter, modern descendants of Ascalonians are treated as dangerous zealots.
</li></ul></li><li> Duke Crabtree from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZapDramatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZapDramatic">Zap Dramatic</a>'s <em>Ambition</em>. We're apparently supposed to see him as an egotistical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> who is out to steal your job, but he appears to be far more competent than the player character. He'd probably be better suited for the job. While we as the detective spend about half of Episode 6 sleeping, Duke is actually doing work. While interrogating Bridget, if you end the interrogation too early, Duke will helpfully inform the player that Bridget contradicted herself and tell us to go back and "nail her." When you are interrogating Bridget near Ted's cell, Duke will ask the valid question of why we are exposing the suspect to a known violent criminal. One possible response to this is to call Duke a meddling creep and then punch him in the face. This results in a game over, but the fact that the option is there in the first place clearly indicates that we're not supposed to like Duke. Duke <em>does</em> insult the player, but the attentive player should notice that Duke only insults you when you waste time, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after you get a confession from Bridget</span>, he stops insulting you entirely and works with you to try and solve the case. Somewhat negated by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Duke actually becomes genuinely villainous in Episode 10. It is revealed that he is in on the plot to frame Ted Hadrup for murder, and then he hijacks your cab and takes you somewhere to kill you. However, he still qualifies because we're supposed to see him as villainous from the start even though he doesn't do anything particularly villainous before being revealed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a></span>.
<ul><li> Helen is portrayed as unreasonable and overemotional about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her husband cheating on her. In "The Tryst," telling Yale to break off his affair with Angie and stick with Helen causes you to lose.

The only points that make him a villain are when he goes too far in trying to fix things, like his abrasive way of confronting Kate (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which ended up being one of the driving forces in her suicide attempt</span>), and slapping Chloe when she gets fresh with him.

It's just that, well, you're a better person than I am, or ever will be. <br/><strong>Max:</strong> Stop it. <br/><strong>Cole:</strong> It's true. I'm petty, selfish, jealous, and small. You're none of those things, Max. You never have been. You're a big reminder of just how flawed I am, and how very little I've grown. Sometimes that's hard to be around. But I'd like to try, Max.

The prequel makes this worse, as it reveals that the heroes' feud against Sissi was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">their fault to begin with</a> and she became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> in response.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons">Deputy Dawg</a></em> is a full time case of this. While he at least gets some moments of justice, most of the time we are supposed to root for the mischievous, thieving animals the law-abiding dog is trying to keep in line. Used most erroneously in an episode where a beaver is flooding the forest with his dam. Despite the beaver refusing to take it down solely out of pride, Deputy Dawg is the one presented as being unreasonable and ends up humiliated and submitting.
<ul><li> In a zig-zag, one <em>Deputy Dawg</em> cartoon had DD running for re-election. The animals rig the election so that Vincent Van Gopher would win and thus get carte blanche to do whatever they wanted with no culpability.

Sometimes he is indeed the one that starts the conflict, other times he is just minding his own business, and whatever character he is facing off against decides to antagonize him for no other reason than because he is there.

The heroes generally consider them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet">the highest form of scum</a>, however in early episodes they were more or less established as unwilling slaves of Zordrak who got their numbers thinned out the longer he had to wait to get the stone. Even their zeal and motives come off far less petty than the heroes, who inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> on them every time they try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle">give them nightmares</a>.

The episode where he appeared suggested people should hate him for opening a rival restaurant next to I.M. Neighborly's and taking Neighborly's customers away by offering them free sodas. It also suggested that it was okay for Dodgers and Neighborly to sabotage Melvin's in a way that, in real life, would get them arrested for not only damaging private property but also endangering the lives of everyone inside. Dodgers treated it like a space battle.

They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">always lose and end up being treated horribly</a> by the end of nearly every episode and Eddy is the only one that ever deserves any of it, even if they didn't even do anything that bad. Add to this the fact that most of the rest of the cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">gets away with</a> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">insufferable little assholes</a> who are unconditionally mean to the Eds with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfDisproportionateResponse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfDisproportionateResponse">little</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">no</a> provocation.

More often than not, he (or the other Eds) put a lot of effort into these businesses. An example of this is an incredibly elaborate theme park ride that showcases the sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology">Bamboo Technology</a> we might expect from the future, not unlike the kind people ride frequently at Disney World. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They eventually manage to break out of their role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show</a></em>.</span>

Oddly enough, Timmy is this in "The Masked Magician". Bickles came dangerously close to destroying Dimmsdale simply because Timmy (unknowingly!) showed up his own magic show, and yet its Timmy that's presented as being in the wrong and the one who has to apologize in the end!
</li><li> Blendin Blandin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> is portrayed as an antagonist for being a stressed-out guy who doesn't want 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel using a time machine device because it's his own property. This unfair treatment is brought up in "Blendin's Game", where the twins make it up to him for unintentionally ruining his life. In his second appearance he <em>does</em> claim he'll use his Time Wish to ensure Dipper and Mabel were never born which seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, but of course this could've simply been a bluff (especially since he already threatened to go back in time and prevent their birth at the end of his debut episode, and yet seemingly never got around to it).
<ul><li> That being said, Blendin is absolutely terrible at his job. So much so that after he gets his job back due to Dipper and Mabel in Blendins Game, he gets tricked by Bill and nearly causes the Apocalypse. So maybe we shouldnt feel too sorry for him.
</li></ul></li><li> Minx from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> usually averts this, clearly being a villain in most episodes. In one episode, however, Minx <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">becomes indebted to Rio</a> after he saves her from drowning and undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. She ends up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">Unwanted Assistance</a> to Rio and his friends, but she really didn't do much wrong despite being painted as a villain. She gave some of the Starlight Girls toys and sweets, which causes Jerrica to get mad at <em>Minx</em> when the kids get stomach aches from eating too much candy and make messes with their squirt guns. This is despite the fact that Jerrica is their guardian, not Minx, and Minx didn't make the girls do anything. She also installed a house alarm for them, which causes the Holograms to get mad at her when Kimber forgets the alarm's code. It wasn't her fault that none of them remembered the password. Minx was being overbearing, but she didn't need to take the brunt of their anger and isn't wrong for getting angry at the end of the episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with The Beekeeper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a>.</em> Unlike the other villains, who want to take over or destroy the world, The Beekeeper just wants to get kids to eat healthier. The characters even lampshade that this wouldn't be a bad thing if he wasn't so crazy about it. Turns out his candy bars are pretty tasty as well.
<ul><li> Luckily, by "Johnny Holiday", The Beekeeper is no longer an antagonist, as both he and the Tests team up to create a holiday in which free candy (or rather, honey bars) are given out. Thus, after this episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">The Beekeeper hasn't been seen since.</a>
</li><li> Played straight in, among other episodes, "Johnny Test in 3D" - the hotel manager is the bad guy simply for trying to enforce the no-pets policy.
</li><li> Sunblock Mom is an antagonist in "Sunshine Malibu Johnny" for trying to get Johnny to put on sunscreen. Subverted when the episode ends with Johnny stuck in bed suffering from a bad sunburn because he didn't put on the sunscreen.
</li></ul></li><li> In the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, an American Senator has a proposal to rid the world of nuclear weapons by having Superman work round-the-clock to dismantle the nukes of every country on Earth (it's implied that all the countries agreed to this). While he's outlining the proposal, an angry American General stands up and declares that he shouldn't do it because "Those weapons are our only defense against aggression!" (in this continuity, the Earth had just barely escaped an alien invasion by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>...and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> as well...only a few years earlier). The American general is accused of warmongering and shamed into silence and the nuclear disarmament begins. Then, after all the nukes in the world are disarmed, it turns out that the Senator was actually an evil alien in disguise and the disarmament plan he proposed was intended to keep the nations of Earth from destroying the alien ships that were about to invade. Oops. Guess you should have listened to the warmongering American General in the first place, eh? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5covn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5covn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5covn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The funniest part of that episode is that when the invasion began, the Senator (who hadn't yet been revealed as an alien) appeared on television and announced that "no one could have predicted this would happen". Well, no one except for, um, the American General who said those nukes were, quote, "our only defense against aggression".</span> This is clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">satirizing</a> the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a>.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Even if Mr. Cat hasn't done anything wrong in the episode (yet), he still gets tortured and the audience is supposed to find this funny. In episodes like "Let's Play Cops and Robbers", he even gets punished for things he didn't do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>: One episode revolves around the Lion Guard stopping a family of jackals from hunting "little ones" (baby animals). The problem is that the episode presents them as villainous for hunting young animals, despite this being how many predators hunt. Two of the Lion Guard, Kion (lion) and Fuli (cheetah), are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">large carnivores themselves</a>, which adds to the confusion of stopping the jackals from getting food. The jackals are antagonistic for "invading" on Prideland territory, as the family was previously banished to the Outlands for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengersAreScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengersAreScum">sneaky and malicious</a>, but the episode puts a lot of emphasis on the jackals being evil baby eaters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrizFreleng" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrizFreleng">Friz Freleng</a> took this view of Elmer Fudd in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>, arguing that Elmer, as presented, ended up being too sympathetic and too low on actual evil: as opposed to more obviously abrasive or villainous characters like Yosemite Sam, Elmer is just a guy who wants to hunt a rabbit, and he never seems to be much of a threat to Bugs, since Bugs always gets away from him easily. In his view, Elmer came across as less of an antagonist and more of a bullying victim.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Iron Will runs a legitimate business in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewASpine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewASpine">assertiveness training</a> (although its practices are arguably somewhat extreme). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Fluttershy</a> takes his lessons too far, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">becomes a fearsome bully</a>. While her friends choose to blame Iron Will, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Fluttershy instead takes responsibility for her actions.</a> While Iron Will still sort of acts as the antagonist in the final scene, he's never really shown as in the wrong, just rude. While he suggests that he's going to be violent towards the end, at this point he thinks Fluttershy is trying to avoid paying him and has effectively stolen from him. She then goes and admits that since she wasn't 100% satisfied, she doesn't have to pay and Iron Will accepts this after making sure (probably the first time anyone has actually used that tidbit) without conflict and learns from the experience. Played Straight outside of the show, where Iron Will is often grouped with the show's actual villains in merchandise.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted again</a> in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comics/MyLittlePonyFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comics/MyLittlePonyFriendsForever">MLP: Friends Forever</a> Issue #10.</em> In the very beginning, he's angrily searching through Ponyville for Fluttershy, but the Mane characters are actually surprised that he's looking for her for some anger management rather than retribution. It's revealed that he's not really a bad guy so much that he has anger issues, and can honestly be a pretty decent person if he tries to be more patient.
</li><li> A straighter example with Iron Will pops up in <em>Once Upon A Zeppelin</em> where he uses "pushy and manipulative" tactics to get customers aboard his Princess-themed cruise, but the fact remains that he gave Twilight's entire family a free cruise and clearly outlined the terms of it in a consent form which Twilight Velvet didn't bother to read before signing. In fact, when Twilight takes offense to the terms he even offers to tear the contract up and free them from their obligations, but understandably cancels the cruise and points out how disappointed the guests will be if they do, and Twilight not only refuses but actually <em>offers to take on additional responsibilities</em> so her family and friends can enjoy themselves. Pushy and manipulative or not, he was well within his reasonable right to expect them to honor the agreement and Twilight was only so overworked because she decided to do the work of multiple princesses, making it <em>very</em> hard to blame Iron Will for any of the events that happened.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Twilight Sparkle:</strong> Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me! <br/><strong>Iron Will:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">Iron Will outlined all the details of the cruise in the Prize Acceptance and Consent Form that you signed.</a> <br/><strong>Twilight Velvet:</strong> Well, when somepony offers you a free vacation, who reads the fine print?
</div></li><li> For Trixie, this trope is played straight once and later deconstructed twice.
<ul><li> Her initial appearance in "Boast Busters" displays her as a showy magician who is merely establishing mystique in a manner very much akin to real-life performers. After some of the Mane Six come to the conclusion that she's a braggart and begin heckling her, she reveals herself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Miles Gloriosus</a>, accepts their challenges and makes fools of them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">bolster her own image</a>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">bullying Twilight who played no part in the heckling</a>. Later, however, a monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">destroys her caravan (and presumably causes loss of her livelihood) and none of the protagonists express sympathy for her but continue to comment on her arrogance</a>, while Snips and Snails who brought the monster into town on purpose in the first place get "punished" with free mustaches. While a nasty and arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, she's no villain, though.
</li><li> The first deconstruction comes in "Magic Duel". Trixie not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">calls out the town on the way they treated her before</a> but also points out she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">lost everything</a> thanks to what happened in Ponyville. Her revenge against Ponyville is also somewhat justified as residents of said town are shown <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/169440">vandalizing her new cart<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the worst of her vengeance is aimed at Snips and Snails who got off scot-free for the problems they caused the first time around. Ironically, she ends up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for that episode, having obtained - against the shopkeeper's own advice - the magic mind-control amulet for revenge in the first place. Even the others admit she wasn't <em>that</em> bad beforehand.
</li><li> Deconstructed again in "No Second Prances" where Twilight Sparkle was willing to give the dangerous and possibly psychotic Starlight Glimmer a chance at redemption but rigidly refuses to drop her personal grudge with the decidedly less villainous Trixie. The episode features Twilight being called out for it several times and gives her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment when it hits her just how badly she's harming Trixie.

</li><li> Happens all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, often deliberately due to the skewed naive perspective of the babies:
<ul><li> Didi hires a dog groomer for Spike. The babies, thinking she's a "dog broomer" who kidnaps dogs, cause all sorts of mayhem for her ("What else could a dog broomer be?"). True, Spike didn't want to get groomed, but that would make Didi the villain here, not the groomer.
</li><li> A teenager hired to work in the Java Lava is a bit moody and surly but the babies assume she is Angelica's doll grown huge and try to shrink her by <em>pulling out her belly button ring</em>. And they mess up the coffee shop and when the girl tells everyone that they did it they almost fire her for "blaming it on the pups," but she quits in agitation and disgust before they can.
</li><li> Angelica herself in the episode "Silent Angelica". Drew and Charlotte promise to buy her toys if she stays quiet and watches the babies. Angelica actually tries her best to stay quiet but the babies take advantage of this and run wild around the house. Angelica finally snaps after they've caused so much mayhem, but then Drew and Charlotte punish her for it when she had done nothing wrong at all.
</li><li> Some of the babies' theories on "villains" run so much on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> that it's lucky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader">some of them aren't even real</a>. For example they hear the story of the Sand Man, and worry about the off chance that he may accidentally bury them with too much sand while putting them to sleep. They ultimately come to the conclusion they must <em>kill</em> the Sandman. Naturally there is no Sandman for them to murder, though they spend most of the episode mistakenly beating up Chuckie's dad in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight with the tenants Marge invites to live in the house for the holiday. They are supposed to be seen as selfish and evil for constantly complaining, ruining Marge's Christmas, but this ignores the fact that the only reason she was able to have a Christmas was that she invited an inordinate amount of people to her house, promising them a ludicrous amount of activities which she didn't have any hope of providing.
</li><li> Bart and Homer's attitude towards George Bush Sr. in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors">Two Bad Neighbors</a>". Bush is repeatedly portrayed as a fun-hating sourpuss, despite the fact that a lot of his frustration comes from Bart's annoying behaviour. Homer's beef with Bush is that he's more popular with the neighbours than Homer. The episode ends with Bush having to apologise to both of them and Bart and Homer get away scot-free.
</li><li> Itchy and Scratchy are a parody of this in cartoons such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>. It's very rare that Scratchy's even doing <em>anything</em> before Itchy murders him.
</li><li> Evelyn and the other country club women, save for Sue-sin, in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E14ScenesFromTheClassStruggleInSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E14ScenesFromTheClassStruggleInSpringfield">Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield</a>". While constantly referred to as snobs throughout the episode, none of the women were intentionally rude or even catty to Marge (and, at worst, could only be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a>) and had she and the rest of family went to the big party at the club, they would have welcomed them in with open arms.

All he really wants is for SpongeBob and Patrick to allow him some peaceful and quiet time to himself.

Honestly, many viewers end up sympathizing with Squidward's desire to have some time to himself to relax, away from SpongeBob's loudness and intrusiveness.
</li><li> Mrs. Puff too. Before she attempted to <em>murder</em> SpongeBob, all she wanted to do was to not have to deal with SpongeBob's bad driving, and because of that, it makes her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerk</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">deserves the abuse she gets</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> simply because she dislikes SpongeBob, when really, fans sympathize with her because SpongeBob is un-teachable and Mrs. Puff shouldn't have to put up with him.

Because she was merely an accomplice, her sentence was scheduled to end around the time Krypton exploded. Superman decides to release her in the hopes that she'd become a hero like him (also because he wanted another Kryptonian to hang out with). Long story short, she listens to Clark and helps him thwart some crime but goes a bit overboard and causes damages to civilian property, which causes Superman to genuinely consider <em>sending her back into the Phantom Zone, presumably forever</em>. This, along with an unrelated altercation with Lois Lane about Superman's affections, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">causes her to return to her former leader and attempt to take over the Earth</a>.

The worst examples are when Tom is, in an episode set in the past, <em>executed</em> when he was <em>just doing his job.</em> Tom's job in this short was simply defending his home's supplies and nothing malicious. Hanna-Barbera did seem to wise up to this in many of their later shorts, which often made Jerry more altruistic and Tom more sadistic and deserving of his abuse.

</li><li> In <em>World Tour</em>, she gets the most harassment and blame for Duncan's adultery, even though she wasn't the one who initiated their kiss. This also extends into All-Stars, where she's placed on the Villainous Vultures despite having done more good than bad. To make things worse, every time she tries to apologize or do something nice for Courtney, she ends up either injuring or humiliating her instead, resulting in a delighted Chris telling her she's on the right team after all.
</li><li> In <em>All-Stars</em>, despite the whole love-triangle facade being only partially her fault, she ends up receiving the full blame and the villainous status to accompany it. Immediately getting treated as the "evil boyfriend stealer" and is put on the Villainous Vultures despite "three seasons of niceness".
</li></ul></li><li> Courtney in <em>World Tour</em>. The writers ended the love triangle in a de facto deleted scene with Courtney knocked out by a sandal while Gwen and Duncan happily kiss.
</li><li> Lightning in <em>Revenge of the Island</em>, due to needing a villain to accompany Cameron to the finales, but having both of the season's original villains Scott and Jo eliminated a few episodes earlier. Lightning is immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">granted status as the new</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, previously being just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> who remained fairly neutral (albeit a bit arrogant), he suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a> (with little reasoning) and becomes the villain Cameron faces-off with in the finales.
</li><li> Anne Maria in <em>Revenge of the Island</em>. Because of showing an interest in Mike after becoming Vito for the first time. She is treated as a mistress or someone trying to steal Mike from Zoey despite the fact they weren't actually dating yet. Also, she is only mean when provoked as such by her conflict with Jo or when she led to believe that Dawn stole her brush. Also, the only reason why she pushed Zoey was because of the fact that Zoey was stepping on Jo's oxygen supply.
</li><li> Alejandro in <em>All-Stars</em>, who showed a fair bit of redeeming qualities as he shifts towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> status after discovering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">greater evil</a> that is Mal. However his heroic acts are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam">rejected by everyone</a> due to his history, and is continuously treated as the real villain up until his elimination.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em>: In "The Grapes of Wrath", the eponymous grapes are supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">bunch</a> of jerks, but the only ones among them actively causing trouble are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">the children, Tom and Rosie Grape</a>. Their parents, on the other hand, are shown to be quite a bit saner, especially Ma Grape, who gets on her children's case after Junior Asparagus gets humiliated trying to get back at them for their latest prank. This is pretty much justified considering the story is intended to teach the value of forgiveness<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6lzxi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6lzxi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6lzxi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On a side note, the "70 times 7" thing from Matthew 18:22, a Biblical verse taught in the middle of the story, is taken literally, with the characters trying to figure out what 70 times 7 equaled as Junior tried to find it in himself to forgive them again, which he ends up doing after that multiplication problem is solved</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WabbitALooneyTunesProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WabbitALooneyTunesProduction">Wabbit: A Looney Tunes Production</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "For the Love of Acorns", a kind of conceited baseball player is treated as a villain for wanting Bugs and Squeaks to stop vandalizing the field looking for an acorn and disrupting the game.
</li><li> Carl the Grim Rabbit is treated as a villain for doing his job.
</li></ul></li><li> Magneto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> was often a victim of this, due to the fact that the series treated him as a villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">even while adapting storylines</a> where he was at most a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. This leads to many sequences of him being referred to as "our most intractable foe" despite having actually fought the X-Men only a few times and spent the rest of the series in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situations at his worst. (Granted, the way they were introduced was the X-Men foiling his attempt at <em>nuclear terrorism</em>, so it's rather understandable if they got a bad impression of him.) "Sanctuary" in particular is this, where Magneto creates a new nation in space where mutants can live peacefully, and the only hostile action he takes in the episode is freeing mutant slaves from what is essentially a concentration camp so they can live there. Everyone treats this as a horrible thing that will have grave consequences, but the only reason the plan doesn't work is that Magneto got betrayed by one of his subordinates. If he'd been a bit choosier in Acolytes, he would have done more to advance mutant rights in that episode than the X-Men had in the entire prior season.
</li><li> Ranger Smith to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a></em>, he was treated as an antagonist to Yogi even though Ranger Smith is trying to stop Yogi from stealing people's lunch. In real life, wild animals getting hold of human food is a very serious thing - it can lead animals to associate humans with food, meaning that they have to be killed or relocated to areas where humans are not very plentiful, otherwise the animals might get aggressive and start attacking people. Not that this show's universe has many things in common with real bears. Reasoned in one episode, where Ranger Smith finally gets sick of Yogi's antics and delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> on all the felonies he's caused. Yogi defends himself by pointing out the forest belonged to the animals first, then humans such as himself took over and tried to enforce rules onto them. Yogi steals food, but Smith stole his entire habitat.
