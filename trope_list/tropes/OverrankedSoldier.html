Creators often like to emphasize the importance of a military character by giving him a high rank. This is understandable, since one's first thought when seeing a character of high rank is that he must have gotten that far because of his merits, and there's a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to it. Since, for example, battlefield commissions and promotions have been given to soldiers who've distinguished themselves for great deeds and exemplary service, giving a character a high rank means they must have done something to earn it, right?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>However, writers can take this too far. WAY too far.
</p><p>Over-ranked Soldier refers to a character whose rank is, quite simply, impossible for him to possess. The character's rank is so high, it breaks the audience's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>. While the creator might just mean to use the character's rank to show his importance to the work, it shows the creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary">did not research the plausibility of the character possessing said rank.</a>
</p><p>This trope manifests in certain ways:
</p><ul><li> <strong>The character is too young</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a> as it applies to the military. Quite simply, it'd be impossible for the character to possess the rank at such a young age. Even the most prodigious soldier still needs a certain time in service to possess certain ranks, and some ranks are only attainable after a lifetime of service and excellence. Oh, and the character being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">Ensign Newbie</a> does NOT justify this. After all, it's ENSIGN Newbie, not ADMIRAL Newbie. Note, however, that this reasoning mainly works in times of peace. During high-intensity wars, many of the high-ranked officers who aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear">Soldiers at the Rear</a> tend to die on the battlefield, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">even Generals</a>, creating huge opportunities for promotion. Due to the very <em>existence</em> of the chain of command, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">an inexperienced commander</a> is better than no commander at all. See the below example of Napoleon Bonaparte who became a Major General at 25, because Revolutionary France needed commanders at all costs.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>The character is too disruptive</strong>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> will always be an attractive character archetype to audiences, since we tend to root for guys with guts and attitude. However, this works best with characters who are, at best, in the low officer ranks, where he spends more time in the battlefield than in the war room. The armed forces frown on disrespect to the chain of command, and would not give a high rank to such a disruptive soldier, no matter how much of a badass he is. In fact, the soldier's antics would more realistically result in a <em>demotion</em> instead of a promotion. (Note that Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Arbuthnot Fisher, aka Baron Fisher of Kilverstone, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> exception to this rule, being an <em>incredibly</em> controversial sailor who bruised egos everywhere he went, in a Navy and a society almost notorious for their deference to the chain of authority, and <em>still</em> rose to the very top of the tree.)
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>The character is too incompetent</strong>: Another character type that is common in military media is a soldier who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">high-ranked, yet is actually quite sucky at being a soldier or leader.</a> Think of it as the military version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a>. In humorous media, this is all well and good, since it's just part of the absurdity of the setting, but in more serious fare, it makes the viewer wonder how the hell he got that far (but note that even military organizations are not immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a>). This is aggravated by the fact that rank is partly merit-based, so a soldier that sucks at a low rank will STAY at a low rank (or in most modern militaries, dismissed from service for not making the promotion list).
</li><li> <strong>The character is actively dangerous/insane</strong>: This is a tricky one to deal with, because a character's lack of stability could be a sign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellshockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellshockedVeteran">post-traumatic stress</a>, which is completely plausible and sadly all too common, but this refers to a character who's <em>obviously</em> unstable and the chain of command doesn't do anything about it. If the character develops instability throughout the course of the story, it's completely plausible as long as it is addressed. If the character's instability is a regular part of the character and it is not specifically addressed in the work, it's this trope.
</li><li> <strong>The character is not respected by his subordinates</strong>: Any soldier who attains a high rank gets there both by his merits and the merits of the soldiers under him. A soldier whose subordinates subvert his authority at every chance they get will not reach a high rank, because not being able to lead limits his advancement. Common in humorous media, and animosity between high-ranked soldiers and subordinates does happen, but when it is to an extent that the higher-ranked soldier is disrespected and made to look a fool, it breaks plausibility.
</li><li> <strong>The position the soldier holds is way below their pay grade</strong>: Often, some officers are seen doing tasks more menial than their rank befits, or they are out in combat in situations that high ranking officers would normally not be in. In some cases, this stems from older wars up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">generals would be very close to the battle lines</a> (if not in the thick of them). In some modern cases, it's more about the impression held by some writers that any "important" job in the military must be held by a three or four star flag officer. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrankingYourJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrankingYourJob">Outranking Your Job</a> for examples of this.
</li></ul><p>One thing to note: this trope does not refer to rank outside of the traditional structure followed by most of the world's armed forces. Honorary ranks, ranks based on privilege, or self-granted ranks do not count. A nobleman given a high military rank because of his high status, as unfortunate as it might be, is completely plausible, as are the extremely young appointments made during revolutions, such as Napoleon Bonaparte, promoted from major to <em>général de brigade</em> (major-general) at age 25, or to the inflationary handing-out of ranks such as by the Confederate government during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> (before 1860, the highest rank carried by an American soldier was lieutenant-general (three stars). Jefferson Davis started appointing full generals (four stars) shortly after the first major battle of the war). This trope is specifically about characters in fiction, within traditional military structure, that have a rank way beyond the realm of logic and possibility.
</p><p>Generally speaking, senior members of the British Royal Family hold military rank and Regimental commands, but these are strictly honorary - the real business of command is done by trained professionals and the royals are figureheads. Junior royals are expected to serve as junior officers in the Armed forces, and here their responsibilities and duties are consistent with rank. Prince Charles, for instance, commanded a Royal Navy inshore ship, HMS Hunstanton. (His father commanded a destroyer, with some distinction, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, but that was before he married into the Royal Family. He's Lord High Admiral now, but that is an honorary rank.) Prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War and was a full-time military officer for over 20 years; their brother Prince Edward wimped out of Royal Marines officer training (indicating that some standards apply to Royals as to ordinary joes); the current Duke of Kent served for 20 years on active duty. But older royals are ceremonial figureheads, not active soldiers and sailors. For instance, King George VI had generals' rank, but no generals' duties, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> (though he had served as a junior naval officer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>).
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>, who is Underranked. Typically leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">The Main Characters Do Everything</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>: Justy Ueki Tylor is lazy, having joined the military so that he can retire with a fat pension check. He is also uncontrollable, issuing controversial and outright ridiculous orders to his crew, like "Do whatever you want." He had probably never even seen the <em>cover</em> of the USPF military's rulebook, considering how often Commander Star and Lieutenant Yamamoto have to bring them up. He's also all of twenty years old, and a Lieutenant Commander. The only reason he has that rank is because he rescued an old war hero from a hostage situation. This trope is subverted in that Tylor's irresponsibility <em>does</em> get him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">sent to an obscure section of the galaxy</a>. Sheer luck is the only thing that ensures he regains his rank half the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. All registered State Alchemists receive an automatic military rank of Major, regardless of their age, and afterward they can be promoted like a normal soldier. This is at least part of the reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Roy Mustang</a> is resented by several members of the High Command; at the time of the series, he's only 29 years old and already a full Colonel because he became a State Alchemist at the age of twenty. Interestingly enough, though, Ed is never addressed as "Major" and rarely treated as a superior officer. This is mostly because Ed doesn't hold a high opinion of the military and therefore tries not to play up his status; among other things, he forgoes the military uniform most State Alchemists use for his own trademark red coat. He also has stated that he doesn't really like the idea of people having to "kiss up" to him and would rather interact with others as equals. His low age and, er, stature, also make it easier for those aware of his rank to ignore it even if they are lower ranked soldiers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Reinhard was made Fleet Admiral and placed in command of half the Imperial fleet at age 20. Though he had genuine battlefield accomplishments and his sister being a favorite of the Emperor explained his extremely rapid promotion, it is still ridiculously young. (It was made possible by blatant favoritism on the emperor's part.) Then he creates his own admiralty from officers loyal to him, leading to a group of Vice Admirals in their mid- to late twenties being commanded by the twenty-year-old brother of the Emperor's favorite concubine. Given the setting, though, it actually makes sense.
</li><li> His archrival, Yang Wen-Li, is a more subdued example. He did made a flag rank at 28 (a Rear Admiral, to be precise), which is ridiculously young, but everyone around very much treated it as something exceptional. It was also kind of justified by Yang being a bona-fide military genius who saved the Alliance's collective ass more than once, him having friends<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06hkx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06hkx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06hkx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Alexander Bucock and Stanley Sitolet</span> in high places, who decided just for once to promote a genuinely competent officer instead of a political appointee, and his promotion being in part a piece in the powergames of the Alliance's top brass.
</li><li> Later, as the power structure in both the Empire and the Alliance started to crumble, the chain of command crumbled as well, degenerating into petty warlordships and civil wars, so both men became military dictators simply as a consequence of their fighting prowess and desire to keep at least some semblance of order in their respective nations. Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">Yang became</a>. Lohengramm actively <em>strived</em> for power.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hayate Yagami, Lieutenant-Colonel at 19. Even if you assume she started her career <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">at nine</a> — there are better places to discuss the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> — ten years does not a Lieutenant-Colonel make in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> military barring severely extenuating circumstances. Contrast Nanoha, who's more reasonably a non-Navy Captain. The justifications are, first, that powerful mages are quickly promoted through the ranks anyway, with ranks often being considered "decorations", and second, that Hayate has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">connections in the highest ranks</a> and was bucking for promotion since the day she joined. It's also revealed that Hayate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">being a former criminal</a>, was put in command of Mobile Division 6 because she was considered expendable in case anything went wrong and she had to take the fall for it, and Hayate herself notes that the officers at headquarters tend to see her as a young girl first and a Lieutenant Colonel second, indicators of factors apart from a belief in Hayate's merit.
</li><li> Just as bad: Chrono Harlaown reaches the rank of Admiral with fourteen years in service. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">His mother is also an admiral in the Navy</a> (albeit for an unspecified length of time; she is 31 upon her first introduction), and he's one of those connections that helped propel Hayate to battalion command. In Chrono's case, the justification is that after his dad died in the line of duty when he was just 3 years old, Chrono went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">all</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Bruce</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Wayne</a>, becoming a fully fledged Enforcer by the age of 14. Enforcers, for the record, are the elite of the elite within the Bureau, with the personal authority of a Field Officer, so his advancement to an Admiral ten years later wasn't much of a career ladder jump.

<ul><li> Averted with Commodore Smoker. He is said to be stronger than his Captain rank implies. However, he is stuck at the rank of Captain for a very long time due to his insubordination with his superiors in the Marines. The only reason he is promoted to Commodore at all is part of a conspiracy by the World Government — he just happens to be in the area.
</li><li> <em>One Piece</em> does have a number of examples played straight, most notably Vice Admiral Garp, who actively and openly helps pirates, laughs at top-ranked Marines for their mistakes, and recruits from questionable places. He has been offered several promotions to Admiral. However, Fleet Admiral Sengoku does sometimes wonder to himself how Garp managed to climb up the ranks with the attitude he has. Then again, the Marines are (for the most part) based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>, and Garp is probably the strongest marine in the entire force next to Sengoku himself.
</li><li> While not exactly a soldier, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buggy should obviously not be one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. He's one of the weakest pirate captains in the series, and the only reason he gets the position is pure dumb luck, having been a former member of Pirate King Gol D.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the <em>White Base</em> crew, formerly an irregular unit headed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadet">Space Cadet</a>, is brought into the Earth Federation Forces, most of the crew get reasonable ranks. The exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> Amuro Ray, who is appointed a Chief Petty Officer, a senior noncommissioned rank that usually takes years to work up to. No explanation is given for this. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Tomino</a>'s <em>Gundam</em> novels, written largely to tell a more consistent story after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">all the screenplay shenanigans in the heavily troubled anime</a>, he wasn't even a civilian to begin with, but a fully trained cadet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadet">on his middie cruise</a> shortly before commissioning. After the <em>White Base</em> finally made contact with the main forces he just received the commission he was due.
<ul><li> This is partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> - within military rank structures, officers are leaders with more generalized abilities, and senior enlisted forces are technical experts in their career fields. Amuro was the best mobile suit pilot on the <em>White Base</em>, so being made one of the highest ranked NCOs on the ship was appropriate as it reflected his technical superiority and experience with the Gundam.
</li></ul></li><li> Bright Noa and Mirai Yashima, meanwhile, <em>invert</em> this trope and create another example into the bargain. Once the <em>White Base</em> is regularized, Bright receives the rank of Lieutenant JG, and Mirai is commissioned as an Ensign; this is for the commander and executive officer of a carrier command that previously merited a full captain. In this case, the brass weren't going to break up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">well-functioning unit</a> in the middle of wartime, but they also weren't interested in ranking Bright up too far beyond his seniority (LTJG was already an accelerated wartime promotion). This situation gets downright weird when Lieutenant JG Sleggar Law is assigned to a flight position to replace lost crew; while fitting his rank, the position puts him below Ensign Yashima in the chain of command.
</li><li> On the Zeon side, Dozle, Kycilia and Garma Zabi are a Vice Admiral, a Rear Admiral, and a Colonel, at 28, 27, and 20, respectively. The fact that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">the children of Zeon head of state Degwin Zabi played a major part in that</a>, though Dozle and Kycilia clearly show that they were capable of handling the responsibilities of their ranks. Garma's need to likewise prove that he earned his rank instead of being handed it for being his father's favorite child played a key part in Char's scheme to lure him into the battle in which he died. Char himself made the somewhat more reasonable but still improbably high rank of Lt Commander at 20 as a result of sheer badassery, most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">five solo capital ship kills</a> during the Battle of Loum.

He also hits on every female to cross his path and is continuously rude to every pilot who isn't a member of his original squad. Presumably this is why he's only a junior lieutenant despite being a famous ace from the One Year War, but given that the war had ostensibly been over for three years at the time of this anime, one has to wonder why he's still allowed to wear the uniform <em>at all</em> given his conduct.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellArise">Ghost in the Shell: Arise</a></em> gives Batou the rank of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandingCoolness">Commander</a> during his service in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac">Republic of Kuran</a>. His command there is basically a platoon-sized unit that's normally commanded by a Second Lieutenant. Motoko, a Major, is somewhat more justified, in that she's explicitly from a secret Special Forces unit that uses its officers in solo missions.

<ul><li> Sōsuke Sagara is 16 at the beginning of the anime, but a fearsomely-skilled sergeant in a paramilitary organization, although this is explained by a history as a child soldier in Afghanistan; its also a way to logically hang around the schoolgirl-aged Chidori.
</li><li> His commander, Teletha "Tessa" Testarossa, is about the same age and has her position almost solely by virtue of the bizarre racial memory gift possessed by those called The Whispered, which means that she designed the submarine she commands.
</li><li> Sōsuke's colleague Kurz Weber also qualifies, though not to quite the same extreme as Sōsuke and Tessa; he's only nineteen at the start of the series and the Light Novels eventually reveal that he began training as a sniper at the age of about fifteen.

As far as regular characters go, Captain Stilman is infamous for his cynicism, laziness and general incompetence (although with a few flashes of true brilliance).
</li><li> During the controversial Civil War storyline in Marvel Comics, Tony Stark is examining a file on Frank Castle (AKA the Punisher). The file details Frank's time as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War, specifically referring to him as having been a 21 year old Captain. Even more impressive/odd is that Frank originally enlisted in the Marines, earning an officer's commission later on in his deployment. This may be somewhat justified, however, as Frank was an amazing soldier with a background in black ops; his promotions may have been based on skill as opposed to time served (in the MAX continuity, Nick Fury arranges for his promotion after he and Frank go on an assassination mission).

She retired from the U.S. Air Force at the rank of full Colonel (O-6)... apparently <em>before</em> her first chronological comic book appearance as director of security at "The Cape". Absent some highly unusual situation, one would expect Carol to be at least pushing 40, and this is before her entire career as a superhero. While she's depicted as an experienced hero in current stories, she isn't drawn or treated as if she's anywhere near as old as her backstory would suggest.
<ul><li> This is actually a subversion. Carol retired from the Air Force to become head of security at the Cape with a rank of Major (O-4) at the age of 28, which is impressive, but absolutely doable. Her promotion to Colonel came in the early '00s, after her Air Force commission was reactivated, and was a special promotion courtesy so that she could run a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Before that, her role in Air Force Intelligence gave her "the ability to temporarily upgrade to Colonel on missions" because "the extra clout came in handy", but it wasn't a permanent rank.

Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel)</a></em>, while Hawk is a capable leader, he's somewhat young to have already reached the rank of general, and still spends too much time in the battlefield to be one. The age issue also applies to his predecessor, General Flagg. Modern versions of the franchise tend to have Hawk as an older man, or as a Colonel (and the Joes a smaller organization as a result) to avoid the issue.

This makes a bit more sense than as this is a revolutionary army where promotions are often handed out more by loyalty to the cause rather than by competence.

At the start of the film he's outranked by <em>all</em> of the characters we know as his crew (all of whom had actual jobs and positions); he's still a cadet in training. The plot is basically built to justify this: Starfleet loses droves of experienced personnel, and Kirk receives two field promotions in the resulting crisis.

This is <em>entirely</em> a political appointment; he needs to be a captain because "Captain America" is a propaganda symbol and an ad for war bonds. Also, "Private America" sounds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtrociousAlias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtrociousAlias">less like a superhero</a> and more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallHimMisterHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallHimMisterHappy">something else</a>.

"Fresh meat for the grinder" indeed. Carmen and Zander are watch officers within a year of their joining the fleet. Carl is the only one who seems suited to his rank (Colonel) after going through Military Intelligence training, though his young age still stands out among the older Psi-Corps officers. (Perhaps Psi-Corps rank is mostly ability-based.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> series really suffers from this. Almost immediately after joining the Rebel Alliance, Luke is made a fighter pilot despite almost zero combat experience (this was explicitly his reward for saving Leia and the plans), by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> he's a commander, and a general by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>; not bad for someone who's canonically 25 by the time of <em>Return of the Jedi</em> (though it does help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">he's a Jedi</a> and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">his father's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> skills).
<ul><li> Meanwhile Han is first a captain and then a general in the same amount of time, despite not officially joining the Rebellion until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, and spending the period between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">Empire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Jedi</a></em> in carbonite. Lando also gets made a general shortly after joining the Rebellion himself (though mention is made of him having previous command experience and we met him while he was profitably running a city of tens of thousands, which might explain why he was given the rank). It gets really silly during the Endor mission, where General Solo commands a squad of around ten people, including Luke (another general) and Leia, whose rank is never really defined, but appears to be somewhere between a political leader and a flag officer. At the very least Lando's mission (leading the assault on the Death Star II) was appropriate to his rank.
</li><li> On the Imperial size of things, Admiral Ozzel decides to ignore Vader's plans to sneak-attack the Rebels on Hoth, instead favoring a surprise attack. This gives the Rebels time to defend themselves and evacuate, and Ozzel is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">summarily executed</a> for his blunder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">so that another, actually competent officer can take command of the fleet</a>.
</li><li> The prequel trilogy is much the same: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Jedi</a> are all generals of the Clone Army, but inevitably end up fighting on the field. They clearly believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">leading from the front</a> in a galaxy far, far away. What makes it worse is that the apprentices are given the rank of Commander, but are often shown to outrank pretty much everyone but a higher ranking Jedi (up to and including admirals). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCloneWars">The Clone Wars</a></em> series Anakin's 14 year old apprentice Ahsoka was shown to lead several battles personally, and the results varied from strategic genius to getting her own men killed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">over-enthusiatic attacks</a> (occasionally in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E19StormOverRyloth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E19StormOverRyloth">the same episode</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> when you remember that it was set up by <em>Palpatine</em>, for whom chaos and bad leadership were actually plusses, given his endgame.

Jim Gordon is promoted from Lieutenant to Police Commissioner literally overnight but still rushes out and takes personal command of emergencies when he should be delegating those responsibilities. The promotion is justified in that the top job in departments similar in size to the GCPD is actually a political appointment, and one doesn't necessarily have to have come up through the ranks. It's also heavily implied that Gordon is one of the few in the GCPD who <em>isn't</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a>, and thus he can't trust anyone else.
</li><li> One of the criticisms leveled at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABridgeTooFar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABridgeTooFar">A Bridge Too Far</a></em> at the time of its release was that Ryan O'Neal was far too young for the rank he was meant to be. In fact, O'Neal was actually older in reality than Brigadier General James Gavin was at the time of the events portrayed.
</li><li> Commander Krill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderSiege">Under Siege</a></em> is a mix of type IV-V, harassing and provoking crew members he doesn't like for no real reason, often in ways that blatantly violate Navy regulations. To be fair, Captain Adams had noticed his XO's instability, and after the terrorists take the <em>Missouri</em>, they find he had prepared a performance review for Krill that would have torpedoed Krill's career over that had Adams lived to reach Pearl Harbor and file it.
</li><li> The entire Philippine military in the historical movies <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna">Heneral Luna</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral">Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral</a></em> is filled with these. General Jose Alejandrino in the second movie discusses how he doesn't think there is a single proper soldier in the ranks, bar the first film's General Antonio Luna who actually has a military education and knows what he's doing, as they're either political appointees or capable but generally out of their league. For example, General Gregorio Del Pilar in the sequel has his rank at the age of <em>24</em> and is given command over an entire province with his detractors saying that this appointment is because he's the president's loyal attack dog.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectMoonbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectMoonbase">Project Moonbase</a></em>, Colonel Briteis is a mix of III and V, showing no real leadership skills and totally unrespected by officers both above and below her. She was a Captain who got promoted three grades in one jump for political reasons after completing a high profile mission, and the fact that she wasn't ready for the extra authority shows.

The subversion comes from the fact that she's directly promoted, twice, by the President of the United States, who as Commander in Chief of all American military forces has the right to promote whoever he wants any time he wants for any reason he cares to use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> Citizen Brigadier General Dennis Tresca was a mere Corporal before the revolution.

In fact, it's repeatedly mentioned that the Havenite military is lacking in personnel with the experience normally required for the higher ranks, but they're forced to promote anyway as they need <em>someone</em> to fill those slots. Despite smaller losses, Manticorans also had to resort to rapid promotions during the war, especially given that they have a much smaller population and thus manpower reserves.
</li><li> It's also mentioned that Havenites don't have experience in the <em>lower</em> ranks, leading to officers carrying out tasks that the Manticorans have Petty Officers normally carrying out (this was the case in the Cold War era Soviet Navy, not because of lack of experience but because of specificity of authority levels; USN sailors had broad authority at every level while Soviet sailors got their jobs and did them. This resulted in a system that looked strange to American observers but worked very efficiently in the Soviet Navy). Thus leading to competent officers having to do their own jobs, someone else's job, and likely get promoted to a position they aren't qualified for. And then shot by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a>. Note that because this is a "prolong" society, where the average life expectancy for most humans is about 250-300 years, normal peacetime promotions tend to be slow.

In the neutral nations, such as Solarian League, an officer might expect to stay in a grade for decades on end.
</li><li> The short story <em>A Ship Named Francis</em> is about a ship whose <em>entire crew</em> is this. Massive manpower expansions due to a war resulted in rapid promotion to many of the people who were already in the Navy, some of them to people who didn't deserve them. The Grayson Navy then dealt with this by transferring these people, who are a mix of types I-IV, to the <em>Francis S Mueller</em>, a cruiser which is deliberately never given any important assignments. The crew refer to the ship among themselves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Siberia</a>. The whole thing is extremely silly and ridiculous, but is justified by the story being an explicit parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>, and being written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>.

When he enlisted, he was instantly promoted to Major by "an IBM machine with a sense of humor almost as keen as his father's." Major can never go up or down in rank because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a> Ex-PFC Wintergreen thinks it's funny. In more general terms, pretty much every officer in the book is too incompetent and/or crazy to be suited for their given rank, and most of the enlisted aren't much better.
</li><li> A huge example occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars">Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a>, where Private Vega is promoted to <em>Sergeant</em> on his first day out of boot camp, over other, longer-serving, more experienced troops, due to a combination of nepotism and idiot luck. His absurdly fast-tracked promotions continue throughout the book until he reaches the rank of <em>Captain</em> at the end of several months. Vega thus combines being too young (he's still in his early teens) and incompetence (the most decisive order he ever manages to give is to charge), with an added bonus of being completely undertrained for his rank. Vega was afraid it'd be the opposite of nepotism, due to his relative being the drug-addicted Nod General Vega. His first promotion was due to luck (he randomly happened to see a heat signature of a weapon aimed at his squad from a vent) and skills he gained <em>prior</em> to enlisting (shooting bottles on a farm). His immediate superior even tells him he argued <em>against</em> giving him a promotion because he didn't earn it on merit but was overruled, as this promotion is mostly for publicity. The cancelled tactical shooter <em>Tiberium</em> was supposed to put the player in Vega's shoes.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orphanage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orphanage">Orphanage</a></em>. Jason Wander leads a strike team to one of Jupiter's moons. He is quickly field promoted to general-on-the-ground due to the <em>insane</em> casualty rate. Everyone there including him expect him to be demoted when the battle ends, however he remains a general (at only 19!) because as the "savior of the human race" the brass decided he's more useful as a symbol than a soldier- although he still has plenty of infantry life ahead of himself.
</li><li> In Simon Scarow's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eagle">Eagle</a></em> series of novels about the Roman Army, the two heroes are a hard-bitten centurion called Macro, who has risen to officer rank purely through merit and experience. And Quintus Licinius Cato, a youth who has grown up as an emancipated slave in the Emperor's palace. Macro is told by the imperial legate Vespasian that like it or not, Cato is on an unprecedented accelerated promotion through ther legion's ranks. He must, therefore, act as mentor to a young man who goes from recruit to Legionary to the junior officer rank of Optio in an incredibly short time, assisted by Vespasian's patronage. At first a man with no discernible military skills, Cato grows through the books into a very capable officer and soon outranks his friend Macro. And the manipulative future emperor Vespasian guards them and steers their missions for reasons all of his own...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> notes that Colonel Kasteen and her officer corps are generally very young and inexperienced to be holding their rank and position. Justified because everyone more qualified or senior than them had been eaten by Tyranids, and the Imperium almost always promotes unit commanders from within the ranks rather than transferring new officers in from other units.
</li><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>, the title Ender is promoted from the ostensible rank of Cadet straight to Admiral at the age of twelve. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> for this is the whole point of the book: by this point he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has already been the <em>de facto</em> commander of Earth's entire space fleet for some time; once the war is over, the promotion is largely political, and he very rarely pulls rank</span>.

<ul><li> In the backstory, Piotr Vorkosigan made full General in his early twenties. There was a war going on at the time, and the Emperor wasn't able to give him more substantial rewards for his services like supplies or reinforcements. Despite this, Piotr proved himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>, and kept that reputation well into his seventies, despite the nature of war on Barrayar evolving from horse cavalry tactics all the way into the space age over the course of his life.
</li><li> Inverted with the head of Imperial Security through most of the series. It's not technically a military post — the Emperor points out once that while it has traditionally been held by a serving officer, there is no law that prevents him appointing a civilian — but it wields enormous power. When Simon Illyan takes the reigns, he is reluctant to promote himself above his predecessor, the legendary Captain Negri (who never bothered acquiring higher rank because he didn't need it to make people understand how important he was), and thus serves as a Captain for his entire career, while routinely tackling duties that are vital to the continued survival of Barrayar and commanding a force of thousands. He is drawing a Vice-Admiral's pay by the time of his retirement, though.
</li><li> Had Lieutenant Miles Vorkosigan not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">killed his ImpSec career himself</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">with that fake report</a>, <em>he</em> would've become its head, as Illyan was already contemplating retirement and has been consciously grooming Miles as a successor all that time. So instead the job ends up going to someone who had already achieved flag rank as one of Ilyan's department heads, breaking the tradition of ostensibly underranked intelligence chiefs.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oz">Oz</a></em> books, it's clear that nobody in Oz really understands the point of the military command structure. The third book depicts an army with something like 50 officers and one enlisted man, where the only duty of the officers at any given level is to listen to the orders given to them by the officers in the level above them and repeat them to the officers at the level below, until they finally reach the one man who does any actual fighting.

The truly absurd number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestOfMedals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestOfMedals">awards for valor</a> she'd received by then played a major part in this (and most of those were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion">acting ranks</a> that she developed the clout to have made permanent). Also there's a strong political motivation since she's a "princess" and her great-grandfather is the king (it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a> but he's suggested to be grooming her as his successor). She really <em>is</em> that good, but she sometimes comes in for grief from officers who followed a more conventional career path.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> series, Kris's rival-turned-friend Vicky Peterwald is field-promoted from lieutenant junior grade all the way up to <em>vice admiral</em>, since she's in charge of one of the sides in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> against her in-laws. To her credit, even <em>she</em> thinks this is utterly bonkers, and she defers detailed battlefield command of her forces to lower-ranked admirals because she mostly lacks the experience to go with the rank (a realization aided by the fact that her older brother was given command of a task force for political reasons, failed to understand that he didn't have the experience to actually command it, and promptly got himself killed as a result). In <em>Dominator</em> she actually <em>refuses</em> yet another promotion to five-star (she's a <em>de facto</em> head of state at that point, and heads of state have traditionally taken on the highest rank in their militaries).

Although, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekStargazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekStargazer">Star Trek: Stargazer</a></em> novels, it's clear his promotion is opposed by Admiral McAteer, who clearly sees Picard as too young to be in command but can't override another admiral's promotion without cause. That said, the unusual circumstances of his promotion, as well as the eventual fate of the <em>Stargazer</em>, may well have put his career into something of a holding pattern, as he's canonically 60 when he takes command of the <em>Enterprise</em>, still a Captain (though on the flip side, the <em>Enterprise</em> is still the flagship and he's basically a half-step below Admiral at that point). The funny thing is that McAteer's most defining character trait is his ambition. He is even disgusted with the message of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> that ambition is evil for that same purpose. Yet he somehow feels that this doesn't matter in Picard's case.

If nothing else, he should have gotten an automatic promotion to Lieutenant Junior Grade at about the midpoint of season two. He hangs a lampshade on this in one of the later seasons, telling Janeway that if not for <em>Voyager</em>'s special circumstances he'd be at least a Lieutenant, and possibly a Lieutenant Commander. In fact, two other characters did get promotions during the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">The meta reason</a> is that showrunners Berman and Braga were determined to maintain Kim as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">Ensign Newbie</a> character regardless of whether it made sense or not.

He comes off as about 19, although Rick Springfield was actually about 29 at the time. If he's that young and inexperienced, even in war, at his first patrol he should have been one or two ranks lower in grade... At least if the Colonial space forces actually <em>have</em> a lower rank for commissioned officers with flight status; in some real-life militaries the rank of Lieutenant j/g or Ensign is only given to non-pilot aircrew or ground support personnel, at least in peacetime.
<ul><li> The "if they have a lower rank" caveat is important, as <em>Galactica</em> has never had a rank system which aligns with any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> western military (for instance, at least in the US military, a Colonel would almost never work for a Commander, as he'd typically outrank them).

<ul><li> In the Starfleet tutorial you go from a junior ensign (a fresh Academy graduate in the revamped version) to captain of your own ship in one battle. Justified in that the entire senior crew is dead so you have seniority. You retain your command seeing as you managed to pull off a victory that more experienced officers couldn't have. You do <em>not</em>, however, get promoted to captain, just lieutenant (you get your own command, but it is a small, really old ship, so there's a certain logic in it). Captain is a mid-game rank, so there is a bit of work ahead before you actually become one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> with the other two factions: the Klingon Defense Force PC is introduced as second officer of a bird-of-prey (with a significantly more open-ended backstory) and takes command via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> (the Klingons have a much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>-based promotion system), and the Romulan PC is part of a rebel faction with a less formal command structure (and supplies their own ship).

But apart from getting the ability to call in one other ship to help you out if your hull drops below 50%, there's no real difference from when you hit captain at level 30. You're still flying just one ship instead of commanding an organization, you regularly get ordered around by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> you outrank, and there isn't a single mission available that makes more sense for a flag officer to handle than a captain (for that matter a lot of the grinding side missions make more sense for <em>enlisted</em> personnel). Eventually an Admiralty system was added where you send out ships represented by tokens on missions almost purely so that there would be something recurring that <em>does</em> make more sense for admirals/generals than captains/commanders.
</li><li> Inverted by Subcommander Kaol in the end-game: he is placed in charge of a joint alliance of the Federation, the Romulan Republic and the Klingon Empire on a critical mission to investigate the technologies of an ancient artefact (that also links to the Delta Quadrant) and neutralize a major and highly classified threat (Omega particles)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07z2n');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07z2n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07z2n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the show, at least for Starfleet, captain is the minimum rank at which Omega particles are even declassified at all</span> created by the artefact, and co-ordinates the alliance forces in a major conflict with the Voth. But subcommander is an OF-5 grade (equivalent to a Starfleet commander), meaning a mere <em>captain</em> outranks him (and thus so does every single player character he interacts with, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere">Dyson Sphere</a> is restricted to level 50 and thus OF-8 characters and above).
</li><li> Inverted <em>again</em> by Kagran, who leads the entire Alliance war-effort against the Iconians (in other words, he commands the combined military forces of the Federation, the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Republic as well as support from several other Alpha and Delta governments, in a life-and-death struggle for the survival of their peoples).

</li><li> Sidestepped by Jem'Hadar (whose captains <em>start</em> at level 60, Honored First), where the actual promotions stop at First (roughly equivalent to captain, and placed as such so your subordinates top out at Second) as per the Dominion giving higher command authority to Vorta who are outside the Jem'Hadar rank system. Every subsequent "rank" is simply an adjective appended to First to indicate respect for competence and experience. On the flip side they get hit with an unavoidable inversion — in normal circumstances Jem'Hadar Firsts do not actually get to command starships, instead passing on orders from a Vorta commander to the rest of the crew, but the Jem'Hadar PC gets to command a starship autonomously.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>. One trailer specifically shows a SolForce destroyer commanded by a Lieutenant. This is justified in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background material</a> due to humanity still recovering from various wars and nuclear devastation, so the SolForce ranks are a bit thin to afford a Commander for each ship, especially since destroyers are fairly tiny by starship standards (30 meters in length — smaller than a Space Shuttle) and command a crew of a few dozen at most. Destroyers also drop like flies. The battlegroup in that trailer got wiped out in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, a destroyer still has enough firepower for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">Orbital Bombardment</a>, killing millions if it's not stopped. So they put a WMD in the hands of a Lieutenant.
</li><li> By the time the third game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> trilogy rolls around, pretty much everyone who's worked directly with Shepard has gained rank if they're in any chain of command, some quite significantly. Even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack</span> is a military instructor, despite being a confirmed terrorist. <em>Completely justified</em> though, because only the human military had even a handful of people believing Shepard and his/her crew <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">right up until the Reapers starting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">wrecking everyone's shit</a>, at which point the galaxy realized who they needed to be listening to.</span> Plus, they all definitely have the merits to qualify for their various promotions.
<ul><li> Lt. Alenko becomes Maj. Alenko, thus technically outranking Shepard while not onboard the Normandy or Gunnery Sgt. Williams becomes Lt. Cmd. Williams.
</li><li> Detective Vakarian holds an unspecified rank in the Turian Hierarchy but is saluted by generals and advises the Primarch due to being one of a handful of people in the galaxy with actual experience vs Reapers. The meritocracy of the Turian Heirarchy was previously noted to allow for very rapid promotion.
</li><li> Engineer Tali'Zorah becomes one of five admirals of the Quarian people. She had been groomed toward the position previously held by her father well in advance.
</li></ul></li><li> If they survive the Fifth Blight, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> is promoted to the rank of Warden-Commander of Ferelden, the second highest rank in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">Grey Wardens Order</a> despite having joined the Order a mere year prior and being hinted as rather young in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGameOpenings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGameOpenings">origins</a>. Justified by the act that the protagonist is one of the only two surviving Fereldan Grey Wardens, and the other one either doesn't want or cannot accept the job.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> game, the player character starts as a newly-commissioned 2nd Lieutenant, and can potentially get promoted all the way to Lt Colonel over the course of the game and the two expansion packs (Maybe a year in-universe), along with getting an enormous number of medals, including the equivalent of two Medals of Honor. Despite this, the player never once gets authority over anyone other than his wingman (regardless of which pilot is higher ranked). The sequel has the character demoted to Captain for allowing his carrier to get destroyed, get stuck at that rank for ten years because of the stigma associated with the failure, and then jump three grades to full Colonel in one go after finally being exonerated, catching the traitor who stole the exonerating evidence, and then single-handedly winning a major victory over the course of three levels. This does not result in any change in the character's actual authority over the course of two more expansion packs and two sequels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom">Mercs of Boom</a></em>, your mercenaries advance in rank with each level. The problem is, by the time they reach rank 12 (somewhere in the middle), they're <em>generals</em>. So you have a squad of 4-5 generals personally attacking enemy soldiers, mercs, mutants, and aliens, even though a general typically commands thousands of soldiers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. On the other hand, you're running a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">PMC</a> company, so the ranks could be a mere formality and don't correspond to any military, especially since there are only two political entities left in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em>, XCOM operatives will start as rookie, advanced to squaddie, corporal, etc, and steadily progress until they're colonels, leading to having a squad of 6 colonels (who were rookies two months ago) engaged in close-range combat against the alien threat. They also show no leadership skills, as they follow the Commander's orders to a tee. In the expansion packs for both games, you can send out colonels for covert actions. In the first game at least, the "rookies" you get are (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">supposedly</a>) the cream-of-the-crop from the most elite of the world's armies, explaining some of the rank absurdity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a> 2</em>, your character goes from being a mechwarrior (the lowest warrior rank in Clan society) to potentially reach the rank of Galaxy Commander (the second highest, after Khan) over the course of the Refusal War, which happened in the span of about one year. Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> in Clan society, your character's rank should have been capped at Star Captain due to lacking a Bloodname and never having the chance to compete for one during the game. And it usually takes several years of leading a Binary or Trinary as a Star Captain before one is judged worthy of competing for promotion to Star Colonel, and an even longer time before being promoted to Galaxy Commander. This is, however, justified due to the sheer devastation suffered by both Clans that participated in the Refusal War to their touman: several canon characters received similarly quick promotions in rank during the war.

<ul><li> It's not explicitly stated, but in "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadassss Song", Skinner's commanding officer appears to be much too young to be a full colonel. Also, his proudest military action was securing a Kuwaiti department store.
</li><li> While Homer <em>is</em> around the appropriate age to command an attack submarine, he has only been out of basic training for a week at most when he's asked to take the conn of the <em>USS Jebediah</em> in "Simpson Tide". Also, Moe, Apu, and Barny, despite having been in the Navy for the same length of time as Homer, are all wearing rate badges indicating that they are petty officers.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xm10');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3xm10" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xm10');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">So is Homer, but his being a nuclear technician makes this more plausible.</span>

He also commands an aircraft carrier, conducts personal inspections of equipment, and supervises routine training maneuvers, all jobs for lower ranks. About the only thing he does in the series that <em>is</em> appropriate is meet with a civilian military contractor to negotiate the purchase of top secret materiel — and he does <em>that</em> while in port in a hostile country instead of in a secure facility ashore.
