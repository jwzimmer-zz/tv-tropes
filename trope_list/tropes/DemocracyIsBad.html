It is generally presented as an ineffectual form of government highly prone to corruption, demagoguery and takeovers by radicals and, in some portrayals, as a form of mob rule which tramples on individual rights to appeal to public sentiment.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>It can also be presented this way by authors who don't necessarily approve of other forms of government, but are cynical enough that they consider <em>all</em> forms of government to be flawed (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnarchyIsChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnarchyIsChaos">with the inclusion of no government at all</a>). As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> put it "Democracy is the worst form of government, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingExceptMostThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingExceptMostThings">except for all the other methods that have been tried</a>".
</p><p>For most of history, say, before the Dutch Republic, the term "Democracy" was more-or-less synonymous with "Anarchy" or "Mob Rule," believed by many to be a utopian idea that could never work in practice and would lead to the collapse of society. The term is rarely used this way today because the forms and ideas of democracy shifted radically from Athens to the Middle Ages. Today we would distinguish between what's called "representative democracy" (in their view a small elite, who owe their election to popular vote, but once in power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SellOut">Sell-Out</a> and serve the hegemony) and participatory or direct democracy in a voluntary form. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">The Athenian direct democracy and the Roman representative republic were both united</a> in their acceptance of slavery, limited and exclusive franchise and suffrage, and an elite constituency that to modern sensibilities qualifies as an oligarchy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uas6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uas6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uas6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Contrary to popular belief, the term aristocrat comes from democracy rather than kingdoms. It originally referred to the elite voting base in Athens</span>. When historically, people criticized democracy as "mob rule" or unworkable they largely had in mind Athenian direct democracy, or what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">they thought was Athenian direct democracy</a>. The more utopian forms of "direct democracy" advocated today by anarchists or anarcho-syndicalists were criticized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a> theorists for being unworkable for governing a large expanse of land, especially as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">The Republic</a> was evolving from being the government of city-states to nation-states, and the latter idea of democracy (representative but with a progressively expansive and inclusive franchise and suffrage) is the system that has consensus today.

</p><p>Historically, to avert this, sometimes people have used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a> defining their ideal governments as republics, as opposed to democracy. This definition did make sense at one time (since it represented a clash between Athenian Democracy and Roman-Style Republic) but modern representative democracy would consider it a tautology: the definition of "republic" is, "any form of government which is not a monarchy or theocracy," and any system in which a large electorate or its elected representatives wield power can legitimately be called democratic. Both systems have certain weaknesses, but both are democratic by definition. A potential wrinkle is the notion of dictatorship which was originally an institution in Republican Rome but in the 20th Century was cited as a feature of many governments that are neither monarchies or theocracies, and so claim to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">People's Republic of Tyranny</a>.

In a perfect example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">Full-Circle Revolution</a>, the people started executing <em>all</em> minority voters, no matter the reason, and had to vote on <em>any</em> issue.

<div class="indent"><strong>Spider Jerusalem:</strong> You want to know about voting. I'm here to tell you about voting. Imagine you're locked in a huge underground nightclub filled with sinners, whores, freaks and unnameable things that rape pit bulls for fun. And you ain't allowed out until you all vote on what you're going to do tonight. <em>You</em> like to put your feet up and watch "Republican Party Reservation". <em>They</em> like to have sex with normal people using knives, guns and brand-new sexual organs that you did not know existed. So you vote for television, and everyone else, as far as the eye can see, votes to fuck you with switchblades. That's voting. You're welcome.
</div><ul><li> Judging by Spider Jerusalem's diatribes, it's not democracy that's bad, but mindless belief in the authority. Most of his victories are examples of democracy working as it was intended; the catch is that it only happens when he kicks, prods and curses the people into using it - and <em>after</em> he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">mauled by cops</a> and/or had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">his life systematically ruined by politicians</a>. Basically, Spider says "Democracy Is Bad - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass">But It Shouldn't Be</a>.</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> revolves around a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">Police State</a> and questions what the dispension of civil rights mean for this dystopian society. The Judges claim that the citizens need rules to live by and that democracy simply became unworkable (the last elected President having started a global nuclear war), but even Judge Dredd has been deeply conflicted over the legitimacy of the Justice system. After the Necropolis disaster a referendum is held in Mega-City One about whether to restore democracy. But at this point, the city has been a dictatorship for over 40 years, so the overwhelming majority of those who even bothered to vote choose to maintain the status quo. The run-up to the last election before the Day of Chaos was essentially a media circus between a number of candidates with no real political platform, including a sudden merger between the Liberal Party and the Illiberal Party to form the Illiberal Liberal Party. It's because in the setting, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons">Humans Are Morons</a>. Some of Mega-City One's citizens even argued that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Judge Death</a> was a "political prisoner" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">started a campaign for his release</a>.
</li><li> Marvel often dips its toe into this in issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> where Doctor Doom does in fact conquer the world. Without all that meddlesome democracy getting in his way, Doom usually ushers in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia">glorious Utopia that just so happens to line up with the writer's own beliefs</a>. Remember, kids, benevolent fascism is the way to go! Given that Doom's entire life mission is to prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards Is Useless</a>, this actually makes sense though.
<ul><li> The in continuity Emperor Doom graphic novel also examined this. Essentially, Doom mind controls the world and eliminates war, poverty, and all his former enemies are happy to help.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> this is especially demonstrated as being very much the case with humanity's reactions towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">mutants</a>. Several dystopian alternate futures have been depicted where the United States government has become tyrannical and made a mess of society in their zeal to hunt down and exterminate mutants. Yet it is usually shown that this happened with the full support of the general public, and the evil government is nonetheless duly elected.
<ul><li> Also, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> is essentially a fight between heroes who are enforcing a law passed by duly elected officials and heroes who believe they should have the right to act however they see fit. Yes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> fought against democracy.
</li></ul></li><li> In the infamous Kauka translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>, the bard was renamed "Parlamet", one letter removed from the German word for "parliament". And it's mentioned that all the other folks in the village wish that he'd finally shut up.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProjectSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProjectSuperpowers">Project Superpowers</a></em> universe, America's democracy has been corrupted by the Supremacy, which has put one of their agents, Power Nelson, in the White House as the duly-elected President Gene West, which thus justifies the heroes overthrowing the government in the second series. Meanwhile, in Europe, the heroic Boy King's goals include restoring his kingdom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Swisslakia</a>, which fell all the way back during World War II; no mention is made of what will become of the government that has arisen since then, although the Boy King insists that there's no assurance that a democracy would be better than the magically-enforced monarchy that he plans to set up.

"Why should I trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away? An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a King can."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>, Leonidas mocks the democratic Athenians as "boy-lovers" who are incapable of defending themselves. Never mind the fact that in real life Athens and its allies drove off Xerxes' father without Sparta's help and the only reason Leonidas joined the fight against the second Persian invasion was so those "boy-lover wouldn't show him up again. And Sparta was just as guilty of pederasty (if not more so) as Athens.
</li><li> The Galactic Republic in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequels is generally depicted as a democracy on its last legs—corrupt to the point that corporations get government seats, deadlocked by factionalism, and hopelessly unable to protect its member states due to not even having any kind of military until the Clone Wars. Its transformation into the Galactic Empire was largely a result of Palpatine exploiting gaping holes in the system, with his predecessor, the well-intentioned but incompetent Chancellor Valorum, failing to come up with a coherent response to the Naboo crisis and giving Palpatine room to slide right in.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Any ten novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> include eleven different forms of government, so he frequently invokes this trope. (The governments of his utopian societies are left deliberately vague - as in they have so little power that the characters <em>never</em> bother to describe them, let alone interact with them.)
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>,</em> the brand new Lunar government is a democracy... rife with obstruction and corruption. Before the revolution the totalitarian Lunar Authority was pretty much ignored, unless the guards got too close to the women, so most everyone lived in what was effectively peaceful anarchy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> famously restricts the rights to vote and run for office to veterans, who (it is argued) have at least some idea of social responsibility. Though unlike in the movie this is in no way portrayed as fascism.
<ul><li> More specifically, the book attempts to make the case for a kind of selective democracy where anyone can vote, but may only do so by first proving they are socially responsible - i.e. by becoming a veteran. Crucially the book makes it clear that the armed forces have no choice but to take anyone who signs up. As long as they are capable of understanding the oath of service, a place must be found for them somewhere in the various armed forces to allow them to prove they are socially responsible and thus can vote. When later questioned if other ways to earn the vote were available or if it was strictly veterans who should be able to vote, Heinlein made it clear that while the book didn't show it, he did believe there should be other non-combat careers or efforts able to demonstrate the social responsibility required to vote.
</li><li> The book <em>does</em> demonstrate that anyone can earn the privilege to vote, and though not everyone can earn it by a non-combat role, some can, as explained by the doctor who says that: "if you came in here in a wheelchair and blind in both eyes and were silly enough to insist on enrolling, they would find you something silly to match. Counting the fuzz on a caterpillar by touch, maybe". Some people sign up for space mining or terraforming work and get their voting rights that way, so the military is not the only way.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MethuselahsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MethuselahsChildren">Methuselah's Children</a></em>, the head of the democratic world government seriously considers <em>sterilizing and/or executing</em> every member of the Howard Families because the sheeple are convinced that they have an immortality treatment instead of good genes. He ends up joining them in exile as their de facto <em>leader.</em> Heinlein shows nothing but respect for a man who is prepared to <em>re-enact the Holocaust</em> for pretty much the same reasons as in reality (a minority is vilified by the majority), saying that it's simply <em>democracy in action.</em> Hell, yes, Democracy Is Bad.
<div class="indent"><strong>Zaccur Barstow</strong>: <em>My people are being persecuted!</em> <br/><strong>Slayton Ford</strong>: <em>Your "people"... ...are a fraction of a tenth of one per cent of all the people... and I must find a <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">solution for all!</a></strong></em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em> Lazarus Long states that he set up Secundus as a "constitutional dictatorship" where the ruling class has some say in government and the common folk, "bless their flabby black hearts", get none. But he's a little surprised that the government has persisted for nearly two thousand years, he expected it to collapse in a century or two. Though his opinion of the government is still far better than what he expects has happened to the colony where the Chairman relocates the egalitarian movements that crop up every so often.
</li></ul></li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> has the occasional stab at committees and one off-hand joke about a species of Republican Bees, who spend most of their time in the hive, voting for more honey. Really, Pratchett seems to prefer the idea of Philosopher Kings. Ephebian 'democracy' (it's a country in Discworld) is referenced on occasion, and criticized for its ironic preclusion of women, poor people, idiots, people who weren't our kind of people, et cetera. Ephebe is basically a humorous version of Athens at its height, and is a fairly accurate description. Athenians invented Democracy, or rule by the <strong>citizens</strong>. What modern people forget is that in Athens, the citizens were a minority of the total population. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em>, Pteppic notes:
<div class="indent"> <em>Philosophers didn't listen to each other, and didn't stick to the point. This was probably mocracy in action.</em>
</div><ul><li> Then there's benevolent tyrant of Ankh-Morpork, Lord Vetinari, who considers his job much more difficult than any elected head of state's: after all, <em>they</em> can always tell the public that it's their fault for voting for them. In the latest offering, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a>" we discover nearby city state Pseudopolis has apparently become a republic of some kind, and Vetinari and a few others enjoy making comments about this. Apparently the citizens voted not to have any taxes for one thing.
<ul><li> It's noted though that there is a <em>sort</em> of democracy going on, i.e., those former patricians that made too many enemies got 'voted' out of office, permanently.
</li></ul></li><li> Sam Vimes, cynical bastard that he is, notes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em>:
<div class="indent">[Vimes] had been rather interested in the idea that everyone had a vote until he found out that while he, Vimes, would have a vote, there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent Nobby Nobbs from having one as well. Vimes could see the flaw there straight away.
</div></li><li> This is probably because his ancestor "Old Stoneface" Vimes (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of Oliver Cromwell) had a bad experience with it:
<div class="indent"> "He introduced democracy to the city, and the people voted against it."
</div></li><li> In later books, Vetinary started assigning disruptive people in large meetings to side committees on the subject of whatever side issue they're arguing about. These inevitably never reached useful conclusions, but their main function was to get rid of the members for a few hours.
</li><li> The King of Lancre attempted to make the country more democratic with the institution of a Parliament. Naturally the people complained that he was trying to get them to do his job for him.
</li></ul></li><li> One Amazon review for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> book "Soul of the Fire" notes much fantasy has this trope implicitly, and that that book makes it very very explicit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolt">Tom Holt</a>'s <em>A Song For Nero</em> features an allegorical aside in which a city-state tries to create the "perfect" system of government, by combining the best features of Athenian democracy (everyone gets a say) and oligarchy (rule by an elite). One suggestion is essentially modern democracy (you vote for the leaders, and then they're in total control for a certain period), which is derided as combining the <em>worst</em> elements of both. (Namely, that oligarchic elites spend all their time fighting each other for status, and leaders who are reliant on the will of the people give them what they want, not what they need.)
</li><li> It can start looking like this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper">H. Beam Piper</a>'s <em>Space Viking</em>, as we watch the democracy of Marduk collapse under the influence of the Hitler-esque politician Zaspar Makann (the main character actually researches Hitler to figure out what Makann is going to do next), but the eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> is actually that it just has a few bugs that need to be worked out.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aristillus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aristillus">Aristillus</a></em> series hammers on this point directly, as the Lunar colony located in the titular crater is founded on principles of radical libertarianism, whilst the Earth overnments have gained control of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">stagnating global economy.</a> thanks to this trope. Anytime the idea of democracy is mentioned, it is likely to evoke an immediate angry reaction from one of the main characters, including the sentient dogs.
</li><li> Comes up multiple times in books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy">Mistborn: The Original Trilogy</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Final Empire is overthrown</span>, the heroes form a constitutional monarchy to administer the city. Ultimately, the elected parliament promptly votes them out of office and sides with their enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">In retrospect, Elend shouldn't have written that clause into his constitution.</a> In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is forced to dissolve the government and declare himself emperor in order to save what's left of humanity</span>.
</li><li> However, by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlloyOfLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAlloyOfLaw">The Alloy of Law</a></em>, set in the same world several hundred years down the line, the <em>Empire</em> has been dissolved and the government is democratically elected and runs seemingly smoothly outside of a fairly normal level of corruption. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elend</span> is even referred to in the histories as "The Last Emperor". Ultimately, it's less the Democracy is Bad, and more that Elend's attempts to set one up were too idealistic and naive for the situation he found himself in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>, Dalinar initially tries to work with the Alethi highprinces peacefully to fight the coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldasWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldasWeKnowIt">Desolation</a>, but eventually gives up and decides to just <em>force</em> them into it. And of course, it doesn't even occur to him to allow the lesser nobles or lowborn to have a more direct say in the matter. In the second book (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WordsOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WordsOfRadiance">Words of Radiance</a></em>), he sadly asks Wit if he's a tyrant. Wit says yes—but unfortunately, a tyrant is what they need right now.
<div class="indent"><strong>Wit:</strong> Do not sorrow. It is an era for tyrants. I doubt this place is ready for anything more, and a benevolent tyrant is preferable to the disaster of weak rule. Perhaps in another place and time, Id have denounced you with spit and bile. Here, today, I praise you as what this world needs.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In an old story (probably pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>) someone (probably a nobleman or such) tells a group of people who demand democracy a fable. Content: The animals set up a democracy. Then, the humans attacked. A part of the animals wanted to fight a war (like the lion, the tiger, the eagle, the bear, the wolf, and the horse) but the great majority was too afraid and voted against it, thus there wasn't a war, the humans won easily and killed many animals. Yep, not only Democracy Is Bad, but Pacifism Is Bad too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s "As Easy as ABC" has the people of mid-21st-century Chicago outraged by a group that wants to institute democracy. They regard this as an invasion of privacy, since it means people who may be total strangers to you are &lt;shudder&gt; <em>voting</em> on, among other things, how you go about your life. A sinister example of how this can be abused is a statue portraying a black man evidently being lynched, with the sarcastic inscription, "To the Eternal Memory of the Justice of the People."
</li><li> In the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em> novel a character converses with Captain Laurence regarding Napoleon. The character is half British but a virtual outcast due to his mixed race status, and reflects that in some ways Napoleon as a tyrant might be less of a problem than the British System, as a single tyrant can be removed, whereas three hundred scheming MPs could hold absolute control (granted this was hardly a time of a fair Parliamentary system either, but the principle remains). Laurence is not amused, though when witnessing some of Napoleon's great building projects in the heart of Paris he thinks it unfortunate that such beneficial, but disruptive and arbitrary, work could only really be attempted by a tyrant unilaterally making the decision.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> takes this all kinds of different directions. On one hand, the protagonists come from a constitutional monarchy and are fighting an oligarchic dictatorship. On the other hand, half of the series is devoted to the heroes being hamstrung by political machinations while the monarch is shown to be correct and yet unable to do anything in the face of opposition of the masses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">But then again</a>, the political machinations stem from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">corrupt and complacent nobles</a>, and the house representing the common man has a majority that agrees with the monarch and the main character and is therefore correct, so basically Manticore is an inversion of this trope.
<ul><li> This achieves further granularity among different powers in the setting. The People's Republic of Haven, for example, had decades of ostensibly democratic rule, but the rulers were so interested in placating their electorate to stay in power that they had to increase the governmental dole to unsustainable levels, forcing them to resort to conquest, and deliberately kept the people dumb to more easily manipulate their votes. On the other hand, the Andermani Empire operates on a strict basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>, and is distrustful of democracies, believing they're too unpredictable and prone to wild shifts in policies between administrations. Then there's the Solarian League, which is technically a democracy but the legislative process is so slow and convoluted that non-elected senior members of the bureaucracy have been running the place to suit themselves for centuries without the legislature noticing, often in ways that blatantly violate the official constitution. Weber's main point seems to be, "Politics is a messy business, and no matter what kind of government you choose, at some point it will suck."

Oh, and foreigners are a corrupting influence in the monarchy, exploit child slavery.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s <em>The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond</em>, the danger of a Royalist pretender is that it might bring about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">Rightful King Returns</a> because of the problems with republics.
<div class="indent"><em>the King has crept back among you. It is not your fault. Republics might be all right if Republicans were as honourable as you are; but you have confessed that they are not . . .</em>
</div></li><li> Democracy is never even brought up in any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> novel, as monarchy, coupled with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Feudal Future</a>, is seen as perfectly natural. It seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a> is not a big fan of democracy.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune">God-Emperor of Dune</a></em>, Leto or Moneo says that setting down a committee to decide which action to take is to make sure that no action is ever taken. This is the closest they get to discussing actual democracy.
</li><li> In the preceding book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfDune">Children of Dune</a></em>, a younger Leto muses that while Feudalism is a brutal mess, it is the only form of government that works in the setting. Humanity is spread over thousands of worlds, interstellar travel is dominated by a <strong>single</strong> corporation which in turn is fully dependent on a substance that is found only on a single planet and can't be artificially made. Add in that all but the most simple computer systems are banned under threat of death — and that means nuking the entire planet of the inventor, just to make sure.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara">Shannara</a></em> series, the Federation is ostensibly democratic and is the villain between <em>The Heritage of Shannara</em> and <em>High Druid of Shannara</em>. The monarchies of earlier novels, which were supplanted by the Federation, are generally portrayed positively, if sometimes insular. The Federation as a polity is mostly presented as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> apart from being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">Anti-Magical Faction</a>, but it seems particularly prone to coming under the sway of evil demagogues.
</li><li> Germany's most famous classical author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> wrote in his <em>Maxims and Reflections</em> that any majority is made up of a few strongmen going ahead, some scoundrels adapting, some weaklings assimilating and the masses who don't know what they want following them. And democracy is rule by majority...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> makes his opinions clear on the subject of democracy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic">The Republic</a></em>. As does his disciple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Politics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Politics">Politics</a></em>. To be fair, the democracy in Athens does not much resemble modern representative democracy (it often devolved into mob rule, because the Assembly could vote basically <em>anything</em> through). What they would have thought of modern democracies is hard to say, but it might have been more positive overall. Aristotle also bifurcated the three political systems he identified into two forms, good and bad: "democracy" is the bad form of a system where power resides with the masses, whereas "polity" is the good form.
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a>'s political tracts and some of his novels, most notably the <em>Littlepage Manuscripts</em> trilogy, bespeak of a growing scepticism towards the American political system, which in many ways overlaps with <em>Democracy in America</em> by his contemporary Alexis de Tocqueville. Cooper was a bit of a social conservative who found the emergent Jacksonian democracy, where the masses' influence gradually eclipsed that of the landed and propertied classes, off-putting. The fact that American democracy in his day happily coexisted with slavery and that Cooper sympathized with the American Indians, who were definitely getting the short end of the stick under Andrew Jackson and the administrations that followed, cannot have helped. Still, more an example of "Democracy is flawed" as Cooper generally portrayed the American republic as superior and more progressive in comparison to the monarchies of old Europe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedVixenAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRedVixenAdventures">The Red Vixen Adventures</a></em> democracy is seen by foxen as a bizarre human thing, and that their feudal caste system is better because their leaders are trained for the job from birth, if nothing else.

The man explains why their people jokingly refer to our world (Earth 2) as "Demos". This is due to the prevalence of democracy as a form of government. The people of Orysaltan, a predominantly Muslim city-state located where Moscow is in our world, practice an "evolved" form of democracy that marries it with capitalism. According to the man, democracy is inherently unfair because it grants each person an equal vote no matter his or her actual contribution to society. Their version grants votes to those citizens who not only make more money but also choose to keep it in the city bank, thus literally investing in their city's future. Those who hoard their wealth have as much vote as those who don't make much money. They are very proud of their "enlightened" system and strive to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Proud Merchant Race</a>.
</li><li> The titular protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainFrenchOrTheQuestForParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainFrenchOrTheQuestForParadise">Captain French, or the Quest for Paradise</a></em> recounts a theory to this effect, although he admits that it seems to simplistic for him. Humanity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a> in this 'verse (set 20,000 years from now) and has settled thousands of planets. But interstellar travel is a very expensive proposition, which means an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngovernableGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngovernableGalaxy">Ungovernable Galaxy</a>. There are, at most, a few hundred starships in existence, and most of them belong to space traders, who prowl the trade lanes at relativistic speeds, connecting the scattered colonies. French has been around since the late 21st century and has seen the various forms of government created on the many planets. According to the theory, democracy is too flawed to survive for long (read: many centuries) and will inevitably lead to radical elements gaining power through legitimate means (as the hamstrung government is unable to do anything to prevent it). After a period of tyranny, the people will revolt, resulting in a bloody civil war. This usually allows some fringe religious group to seize power and impose a theocratic rule, while rebuilding society. Eventually, the people will get tired of casting their eyes downward and praying and replace the religious leaders with a new democracy. And round and round we go. According to French, a monarchy is the most stable government, as long as it's done right. For example, the planet Malacandra has been ruled by a monarchy for millennia, and the rule has been so good that no monarch has been met with a violent death that wasn't the result of an accident or his own negligence (e.g. many of them love hunting dangerous beasts). In all those millennia, there have been less than 30 different monarchs. It also helps that all the regional governors are bastard children of the monarch, helping to maintain stability and loyalty. The monarch himself doesn't do much, as his role as legislator is largely ceremonial, since all important legislation has been done long ago by his predecessors. He mostly relaxes, while his son, the crown prince, does all the work as the planet's executor.

Entire <em>cities</em> can be terrorized with a single <em>handgun</em> because so few lethal weapons exist - hell, one man with <em>unarmed combat training</em> can kill dozens of people because all martial arts have been outlawed by popular vote, under the same distinction as weapons.
</li><li> The enviro-fundamentalist regime of <em>Fallen Angels</em> is entirely democratic; scientists and science fiction fen are a tiny percentage of the voting population, the majority of which believes that science is responsible for the world's woes - specifically an ever-worsening <em>ice age.</em>
</li><li> The core conflicts of the <em>Heorot</em> duology are due to the majority of the population suffering from <em>brain damage</em>, and thus unable to respond properly to threats the few moderately competent among them can recognize; in the first book, no-one save the single soldier believes a man-eating monster could be stalking their exosolar colony. In the second, they have become so reactionary that a handful of deaths is enough for them to abandon a branch colony rather than figure out what the hell killed them.

</li><li> Ever wonder why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> shows nothing from the parliament and first starts as the election results are known? Because, according to the authors, politic is made in the offices, clubs and other discreet meeting points. But okay, with one party having the majority (the usual in Great Britain) the leading people do, of course, not need to care about the opinions of other people than themselves...
<ul><li> The politicians <em>do</em> care about the opinions of people; Hacker is constantly going on about opinion polls and the chances of re-election. The trouble is, he just <em>thinks</em> he's in charge; all the decisions are actually being made by Sir Humphrey. Hacker does have quite a bit of pull (more in later seasons as he gets a better handle on things), but the problem is he is more concerned with opinion polls and elections than with actually running the country in a sensible long term manner. Humphrey, on the other hand, is busy thinking about the government's (and occasionally the country's) best interest long term, but since he doesn't care at all about opinion polls and elections he feels no reason to change the inefficient system that raised him to his current position. As such, both are self interestedly neglecting the greater good, just in different ways. Pure, simple game theory.
</li><li> And part of this is the nature of the British system of politics; whilst the party which forms the government may change periodically due to elections, the civil service which enacts the policy is ever-present and in-theory politically neutral, favouring neither party over the other. And they have immensely good job protection; it's frequently asserted that it's nearly impossible for a civil servant to be fired. So whilst politicians usually disappear after a few years, to a Cabinet reshuffle if not a lost election, the bureaucrats are there until they retire.
</li><li> All the above being said, Humphrey and Hacker get a roughly equal number of plots when they are portrayed as clearly, unambiguously in the right. There's also a roughly equal number of times where they are attempting to manipulate the situation for their own personal benefit.

<ul><li> If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
</li><li> If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
</li><li> There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard-Satterthwaite_theorem">GibbardSatterthwaite theorem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (based on the previous) proves that there is no voting system whatsoever which does not have at least one of the following undesirable properties if more than two candidates or positions are competing against each other:
<ul><li> The rule is dictatorial (i.e., there is a single individual who can choose the winner), or
</li><li> There is some candidate who can never win, under the rule, or
</li><li> The rule is susceptible to tactical voting, in the sense that there are conditions under which a voter with full knowledge of how the other voters are to vote and of the rule being used would have an incentive to vote in a manner that does not reflect his or her preferences.
</li><li> Thus, EVERY voting system is inherently flawed in some fashion.

While some planetary governments practice democracy to some degree, the threat of Chaos is believed to be so great that the people should not be allowed to decide for themselves, and they should be under the constant watch of the Imperial Inquisition. Additionally, large-scale democracy is physically impossible for the Imperium. Travel and communication are so slow and unreliable that they have only a vague idea how many member worlds they even have, much less trying to organize a vote.

J.C. argues that the checks and balances of a western style government allow democracy to flourish by addressing and pre-empting the potential weaknesses of individuals that it would otherwise suffer. The bartender on the other hand has a pro-authoritarian view, arguing that a government that recognizes the weaknesses of the people involved in it would only encourage those same weaknesses in them, and that a government that makes no allowances for such weaknesses would be more effective. Later, J.C. has a similar conversation with the A.I.s Morpheus and Icarus about the benefits of centralized authority versus distributed democracy.

No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor!" Andrew Ryan is an Objectivist and naturally doesn't think too highly of other forms of government, either.

</li><li> Vault City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> considered democracy (or indeed, anyone outside their system) to be bad. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">First Citizen Lynette</a> refers to the NCR's democratic style as "mob rule". So they instead run their state as an elitist, racist, oligarchy that fuels the slave trade. This does not appeal to the rabidly anti-slavery and pro-democracy NCR, to say the least.
<ul><li> Though it is unclear how much of the anti-democracy rhetoric is Vault City's, and how much is Lynette being Lynette (it can be noted that she can go on a defence of Vault City's autocracy despite the First Citizen of Vault City not actually being an autocrat, as Vault City has a Council that can and in some endings <em>does</em> override her decisions). And, in fairness, their slavery is pretty disconnected from the main slave trade of the Wastes (Vault City pretends they are actually opposed to slavery. What they have are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">servants</a></em> under long-term contracts).

The corruption of the NCR's upper echelons and the obstructive bureaucracy that keeps much from actually getting done <em>does not</em> help democracy's case either. On the other hand, the NCR is the most karmically <em>good</em> faction in the game, and they form almost universally good relations with everyone if you help foster peaceful resolutions with the various factions and lead the NCR to victory in the final battle. By comparison, Mr. House will have several groups destroyed or driven out of New Vegas if he wins (and his ending requires the annihilation of the Brotherhood of Steel) while the Legion will massacre, torture, or enslave various groups should they win. And the only other option besides those is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Courier</span> taking over, which results in some good endings and some bad endings as chaos grips certain regions of the Mojave because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Courier</span> just doesn't have the presence and resources to totally control everything outside New Vegas.
<ul><li> Vault 11 doesn't help democracy's case either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The computer running the Vault demanded the sacrifice of a member of the Vault once a year or else it would exterminate the entire Vault population</span>. The citizens of the Vault decided to make the Overseer, who knew about it, double as the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifice</span>, and then decided that this would be the case every year, with whoever was elected to be the new Overseer ruling for a year before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being sacrified</span>. This led to hilarious 1950's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmearCampaign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmearCampaign">Smear Campaign</a> posters with stuff like "Haley is a known adulterer and Communist sympathiser!

To make this even worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a group of people formed a corrupt "tyranny of the majority" and found a way to rig the vote system, so they could effectively choose who would be elected and would never be elected themselves.

The woman started murdering party members, causing the party to vote for her as the next Overseer, which is exactly what she wanted. She used her authority as Overseer to do away with the entire election process and make it so that all future Overseers would picked at random by the computer instead. With their power now gone, the corrupt party got majorly pissed off and started a civil war which led to the deaths of nearly everyone in the Vault. By the end of it, there were only five people still alive. They went down to the computer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith">told it to finish the job</a> since they were done making sacrifices to it... only for the computer to reveal that the whole thing was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> and that they were going to be <em>rewarded</em> for their selflessness in refusing to sacrifice anyone.

The party encounters a group of herbivores who operate based on majority vote, and force everyone to go along with the group's decisions, even if it involves abandoning someone who's in danger or ostracizing someone else. While this would paint democracy in a bad light, the protagonists point out that deciding things through majority vote isn't a bad thing in and of itself, as long as the people involved actually talk things over and come to a decision based on what they believed in, rather than submit to the herd mentality out of fear.
