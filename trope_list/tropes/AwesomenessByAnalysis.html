<ul><li> Mr. Fantastic lives on this trope. Being stretchy and somewhat more resistant to bullets than the normal person would not be the most impressive superpower (though still better than no powers at all), but when it's backed up by a brain that can build nearly anything, including a planet-buster-buster, he's a lot more dangerous.

The Thinker is bowled over by the scope of Reed's calculations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_Cho">Amadeus Cho<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">The Incredible Hercules</a></em> has this as his superpower. He can stop a charging rhino with a grape seed.
</li><li> Bruce Banner has this too when he isn't the Hulk. To the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> considers Banner a bigger threat than The Hulk.
</li><li> Cho claims that the Hulk actually does this subconsciously, since he still has access to all of Banner's smarts, and that that's why in all the seemingly random destruction he causes, innocent people usually escape unscathed. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk">Immortal Hulk</a></em> brings this concept up, with several characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">noting this is ridiculous</a> but then again... when asked about it, the Hulk states that it makes sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">For the nicer Hulk</a>, which he is decidedly <em>not</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel</a>'s Anti-Hero-Villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> can do this with any physical skill he has seen at least once and is physically capable of duplicating (and some that he shouldn't be). However, what makes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a> is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">he's founded a thriving business</a> <em>teaching other supervillains</em>, (his latest job is training the recruits/draftees of The Initiative and latter Osborn's Camp HAMMER) something he couldn't do if he didn't gain a deep insight into the skills he picked up. In fact, he's so good at it that governments have been shown to hire him to train law-enforcement to take down supervillains. This power, however, requires the subject to act sanely and in a recognizable pattern. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> once defeated him by acting at random (eventually tricking Taskmaster into stepping into traffic), and he is powerless against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>.
</li><li> Also from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans">the Inhuman</a> Karnak has the superpower to find the one weak spot in any material or object, allowing him to shatter it with a (non-superpowered) karate chop. He's been shown to damage <em>Ultron</em> with a well-placed strike. And pushing the awesomeness even further: this is not a "superpower." He was never exposed to the Terrigen Mists, like other Inhumans, so his abilities are the result of training and discipline. Eat your heart out, Batman. Later stories show him able to detect the flaws in more abstract things, such as plans and concepts.

<ul><li> The titular Batman is said to have a second major in this, as he is very very much a detective and criminologist when his preplanning everything didn't succeed immediately. An example of this trope in action comes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em> when Bruce Wayne first encounters street hooker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Selina Kyle</a> and quickly realizes "She knows Karate... only Karate."
</li><li> Same goes for Batman's evil counterpart Prometheus, who has created technology that analyzes an opponent's fighting style, allowing him to simulate it perfectly.
</li><li> Batman villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a> became a master of several martial arts and sciences simply by reading every book he could get his hands on.

</li><li> Bruce Wayne (out of costume and with no gadgets) was able to hold off several Talon assassins by simply figuring out that their techniques, while accumulated through years of experience through technical immortality, were outdated.

<ul><li> The Midnighter starts every battle by first running the whole thing through the supercomputer in his head a few million times, analyzing every possible outcome, so he'll know precisely how the battle will go, and what he'll have to do. He's particularly fond of telling people that he's already beaten them a few million times, so doing it once more will be simple. He even put this on a business card once in an effort to save time. This failed, as the card ended up in his forehead.
</li><li> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">rather effectively inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom">Captain Atom</a>: Armageddon</em>.

</li><li> Another failure came about in the miniseries <em>Human on the Inside</em>, in which Midnighter's opponent thwarted him by declining to make the first move, reasoning that Midnighter could only derive the possibilities for the fight once his opponent made an opening move.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries">IDW Shockwave</a> is no slouch at this either, and not just for calculating probabilities or discovering weakness, either. During a fight with the Dinobots, he is astonished by the irrationality of their attack and deducts that it's driven by anger, an emotion that he finds irrational and normally pointless. However, once he sees how it seems to drive up their ability to fight, he patches together a "rage" emulator into his mind and goes absolutely berserk, singlehandedly dominating the Dinobots, and then puts this so-called "anger" on the back-burner for later analysis.

<div class="indent"><strong>Mac:</strong> Were playing the Yankees. No one out. Scales is on first, great speed. Lous up. 2-1 count. Abbotts on the mound, lefty. Lonnies on deck, and remember hes a switch hitter. What do you do? <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> <em>[thinking]</em> Whats the score? <br/><strong>Mac:</strong> Tie game. <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> What inning? Home or away? <br/><strong>Mac:</strong> 8th. Home. <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> Whos catching? Whos rested in the bullpen? Whos up in the 9th for the Yankees? <br/><strong>Mac:</strong> Stanley. Everyone. 7-8-9. <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay. I let Lou hit away. With Mattingly holding Scales, hes got that big hole to hit through. <br/><strong>Mac:</strong> No. See, thats what Im talking about. You got lefty against lefty. Lous a good bunter. You only need one run, so you sacrifice the go-ahead run to 2nd with only one out. <br/><strong>Billy:</strong> No. You sacrifice him to second, they walk Lonnie and bring in Steve Farr to pitch to Spencer. So youve taken the bat out of two best hitters, our 3 and 4 men. And youve got Spencer, a righty with no speed against Farr and his palm ball.

And, for that matter, figure out their general biological traits (dominantly left- or right-handed, number of fingers or limbs used, perceptual or biorhythmic flaws) as well as traits of those who created or even just favor a particular piece. Notably, another character who was supposed to have his tactical insight couldn't do a number of things Thrawn could, and never so much as looked at a painting.
</li><li> Thrawn also had one "failure", where the inferences he'd made after looking at the art proved utterly wrong. In a dialogue with Pellaeon, Thrawn specifically says that his failure to understand a species's art led to him being forced to eradicate said race. Years later, he thinks he's finally starting to grasp their psyche. Such a pity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Outbound Flight</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a scene where Thrawn and three Corellian captives/guests come to look at a very beat-up nonmilitary spaceship that came into his territory, attacked, and was disabled in such a way that all those aboard died. Thrawn asks the Corellians what they think, and one doesn't care, one thinks he killed poor people and/or refugees, and the third looks at the height of the dead aliens, looks at the wall and a point where sealant patterns change texture, and concludes that the people who repaired/maintained the ship were much shorter than the current owners. A bit of information later and he speculates that this was a slaver's ship. Thrawn is pleased.
</li><li> A few pages later, Thrawn says he knows of this ship and these people only by reputation, and that, "The crew complement is smaller than one would expect for a vessel this size. That indicates that they weren't expecting trouble, but instead intended to go straight home. [Thrawn knew while fighting them that they were undercrewed, because...] I deduced it from the fact that their defense was sluggish and mostly ineffectual. They did little but launch missiles. A fully crewed vessel would have had laser gunners in place and would have shifted the defense pattern of their missiles. Clearly, they were expecting their escort to do any fighting that became necessary."
</li></ul></li><li> Thrawn retains this ability in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn">new canon</a>, but his reliance on artwork is downplayed in favor of tactical genius and an ability to read people's body language, right down to perspiration and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">temperature fluctuations</a>.
</li><li> Thrawn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>, Gilad Pellaeon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">graduates to this</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em>. While not a match for Thrawn's ability, he successfully deduces that a fleet of attackers supposedly led by Garm Bel Iblis cannot be, by <em>using one of Bel Iblis's own tactics</em> to defeat it.
</li><li> Thrawn's <em>new</em> Watson, Eli Vanto, is being groomed towards this along the book, bulding up from his understanding of trade, accounting and supply lines.
</li><li> Sort of used and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance">Star Wars: Allegiance</a></em>, where the pirate leader called the Commodore floats in a pool with his eyes covered, the better to focus on the voice of his guest. He believes that doing this, damping down all of his senses but hearing, makes him more able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">tell if he's being lied to</a> and pick out hidden things about the speaker. But he's trying to gauge Mara Jade, who is able to subtly stir the air and water to interfere with his senses without his knowing, and so he misses the fact that she's an Imperial agent sent to find connections between these pirates and corrupt officials.
</li><li> Mace Windu does this all the time. His main Force power is to detect "shatterpoints"; where to hit things, including situations or people's minds, so they break. On several occasions, he has been without a visible shatterpoint and still managed to come out on top. Just before the climax of his feature novel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shatterpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shatterpoint">guess the name!</a>), there's a scene of him "looking" at the shatterpoints for himself, the people around him, the mountain he's on, the war the planet is in, and possibly the entire Clone Wars. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattStover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattStover">Matt Stover</a>'s way of saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Hold onto yer butts</a>." <br/><br/>Windu also notes that during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackoftheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackoftheClones">Battle of Geonosis</a>, he sensed that for a brief moment the shatterpoint of the whole war was Count Dooku. Had he jumped up to the balcony quickly enough, he could've killed Dooku and stopped the war before it even began—but would've died in the process because Jango Fett would've shot him in the back. But by the time Windu had worked all this out, it was already too late and Dooku escaped. And afterward, killing Dooku was no longer the shatterpoint. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padmé would've died along with Mace</a>.

</li><li> In a prequel novel, the first Mentat Gilbertus Albans is forced to aid the fanatic Butlerian movement by its leader Manford Torondo, who has been given 200 mothballed <em>Ballista</em>-class battleships from the days of Butlerian Jihad. On the other side, unbeknownst to Albans, is his top student Draigo Roget, working for Josef Venport, the owner of Venport Holdings. Venport wants to use the abandoned Thinking Machines shipyard to build more ships, but Torondo is determined to destroy any trace of the Machines in the galaxy. As a result, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBattle">Space Battle</a> ensues with the two Mentats squaring off against one another, commanding the fleets. Ultimately, Albans proves to be the superior strategist. This mirrors their virtual match earlier when both of them are commanding fleets of hundreds of ships in a video game of sorts throughout the whole system, using gestures to give orders.

<ul><li> Miles Vorkosigan seems to have the ability to almost unerringly analyze and predict <em>people</em>. He's also had military training and excels at pure tactics (although he finds them boring because they're so predictable), but his greatest victories throughout the series have always been as a result of his ability to understand, persuade, inspire and predict the actions of other people.
</li><li> While Miles tends to compare himself obsessively to his father and grandfather, this ability may well have been inherited from his <em>mother</em>. Cordelia Naismith, in her introductory book, successfully defused a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> hostage crisis by spotting the weak link in both the hostage takers (a man with conflicted loyalties) and Barrayarran psychology (they didn't think a woman could be a military threat) and exploiting them both brilliantly. She also managed, with only a few brief glimpses, to realize that the quantity and arrangement of supplies in the Barrayarran base could only mean that they were secretly preparing to launch an invasion... something even senior Barrayarran officers hadn't realized.
</li><li> Miles's clone brother Mark assumes he also inherited this talent for military analysis and is proven disastrously wrong. Later, however, he discovers his own genius level aptitude for economics. It appears that their shared analytical skill is genetic but the field of application is influenced by their upbringing (Miles on the warlike Barrayar, Mark on the mercenary Jackson's Whole). Mark also shows an impressive eye for detail and an ability to make deductions from situational evidence... as long as he has time to stop and analyze. The implication is that that he has all of Miles's analytical skills but not his adrenaline addiction... meaning that high-stress situations interfere with Mark's ability whereas they enhance Miles's.

<ul><li> Somewhat surprisingly, Archer fits this trope. This is mostly surprising because he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Shirou</a>'s future self</span>. While his physical strength and reflexes aren't much when compared to the other Servants, Archer is able to use his battle experience and cunning to come up strategies to counter and even overpower his more capable opponents and their strategies. The game calls this ability "Mind's Eye (True)":
<div class="indent"><em>"Capable of calm analysis of battle conditions even when in danger and deduce an appropriate course of action after considering all possibilities to escape from a predicament. So long there is even a 1% chance of a comeback, this ability greatly improves the chances of winning."</em>
</div></li><li> The alternate version of "Mind's Eye (True)" is "Mind's Eye (False)". While it confers similar abilities as the (True) version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">it is purely instinctual and cannot be gained through experience</a>: You either have it, or you don't. Two Servants, in particular, have this skill: Berserker (whose madness keeps him from remembering his experience in life) and Assassin (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who as a fictional hero, never had the chance to earn experience in life</span>). In a fight, Assassin was able to tell how long Saber's invisible sword was after observing how she was holding it and feeling the wind from her sword swings.
</li><li> In the <em>Heaven's Feel</em> route, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shirou</span> mimics this skill and uses it to defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Berserker</span> in three seconds.
</li><li> Both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Archer and Shirou</span> also apply this. They subconsciously scan any weapon when they see it and analyze it down to its creation, its history, its previous usage, and the wielder's skill. By compiling all that information and using it to create a copy, they not only produce a projection significantly superior to that of other magi but can also tap into the skills of past wielders to use the weapon more effectively.
</li><li> Not exactly as Analyzing as the previous examples, but Shirou, in the beginning, managed to survive multiple deathblows by Lancer this way. One example being choosing to swing his weapon back just after jumping out of the window to block one, even though he's more-or-less guessing that Lancer would attack him right after, and a misjudgment in timing would result in death.

The road was blocked by a carelessly parked car whose owner was nowhere around. The bus came to a stop and everyone got out and wondered how they were going to get to their destination. Tyson realized he could move the car: he knew that the rear end of a car is much lighter than the front, and from experience wrestling, knew how to lift things using your leg muscles. He lifted up the rear bumper, rotated the car around its front tires, and pivoted it off the road.

<ul><li> Averted with members of Hitler's staff who filled the same role as Cherwell. Whenever Hitler met with his generals, he had extensive and detailed files prepared by his staff about the state of German industries, manpower, supply situation, etc. that no general could defeat his arguments. However, the actual situation on the fronts seldom resembled the official figures, as, even if the figures were correct, difficulties in transportation and deployments often meant that the actual troops had no access to the supplies in question. A case in point, in an argument with one of his generals in early 1942, Hitler showed that sufficient winter gear has been assembled and sent off to the front. Unfortunately for the actual German troops, the lack of rail transport (combined with the change in gauge at the Russian border) meant that most of the winter gear was piled up at train stations and warehouses in Poland.
</li></ul></li><li> Science. Through systematic investigation of the nature of the universe, this enterprise has made possible achievements which would be unimaginable in earlier ages, from the miracles of modern medicine to space exploration to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>.
</li><li> Mostly averted in Real Life, because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">if you think too much about something you become unable to do it properly</a></em>. Also, to use <em>Physics</em> (or at least Mechanics) to work out trajectories, and pointing things in exactly the right direction is damned hard, and all Physical equations are approximations anyway, or they would be far too complicated. To be fair, many of those approximations are very, <em>very</em> good. The point remains that measuring and calibrating everything involved by hand usually takes longer than you have.
<ul><li> If the other guy has rigged a computer to do his number crunching on the fly for him though, try not to get on his bad side.
</li><li> It's also worth noting that if actually practiced, you're able to get over the Dilemma pretty quickly. Intentionally invoke it enough and you're able to use both parts of your brain.
</li><li> There's also the whole issue with that mathematical calculation is only useful to the degree of precision of one's coordination, which is a large part of what practice develops in physical activities.
</li><li> Another way to consider it is that this is what <em>everyone</em> who is any good at things does <em>all the time</em>. Practice doesn't lead one to have better intuition, whatever that is: it burns the math into one's unconscious so that the result is "just obvious", in the same way, that nobody needs to do complex numeric calculations to coordinate the intricate computational nightmare that is their arms and legs. Having to do the math consciously is arguably being <em>too slow</em>.
</li><li> There is a phenomenon, much in the same style as the aforementioned Centipede's Dilemma, called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalysisByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalysisByAnalysis">Paralysis by Analysis</a>. People who train for extreme situations - Firefighters, Soldiers, Police, Doctors and other Medical staff, Bomb disposal technicians, almost anyone who has to make the right call very quickly under extreme stress - can, when faced with the thing they have specifically trained to be ready for, suddenly come to a complete mental and physical halt, because they're trying to figure out the best approach based on what they've learned, and end up doing nothing. This can, on occasion, have fatal consequences. The general consensus is that when faced with extreme circumstances, being trained is valuable, but not as valuable as being experienced.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Similar to engineers, artillerymen, who use propellant and trigonometry to drop heavy explosive shells on targets miles away, often using information relayed to them by forward observers. It is worth noting that the word "Engineer" comes from the guys who operated siege engines such as Trebuchets and Catapults. It took the geeks of the day to figure out how to build a device to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">lob a cow</a> at an enemy city.
</li><li> This is how military general staffs work, as they analyze the potential situations in detail and ensure that enough of the appropriate troops, equipment, and supplies are available for necessary missions (and determine the missions needed to accomplish military objectives.)
</li><li> Sniping tends to work this way. It's often described as 90% mathematics and 10% actual shooting. The snipers' spotters also have to be equally proficient, and carry calculation sheets with them as part of the standard kit.
<ul><li> And one knows it is involved when one has to take the rotation of the earth into account along with one's own heartbeat.
</li><li> And slight precession from the spinning of the bullet. Snipers also often shoot from elevated positions which means that bullet drop becomes a much more complex and counter-intuitive calculation.
</li><li> Temperature, humidity, wind direction, lead time...it's not just the physicality that makes sniper training some of the toughest in the military. There's a very good reason why dropout rates for potential sniper students tend to be appallingly high; if you don't possess any of these required attributes then you might as well consider finding a more appropriate position for your field.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to snipers, many aircrew positions, including pilots, gunners, and loadmasters, require substantial skill and practice in math. The pilot has to be able to calculate wind drift, fuel consumption, and myriad other factors to effectively fly his plane to the destination. The gunner has to be able to quickly do the mental math to have any hope to hit a fast-moving enemy fighter from a fast-moving gunnery platform (aerial gunners in WWII were trained in skeet shooting as a primer), and loadmasters have to figure out how much weight can be loaded in which part of the plane along with fuel and passengers. Even a relatively small amount of weight loaded too far off the center of lift can cause a plane to become unflyable.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> the US Army Air Forces established an Office of Statistical Control that studied the effect of aerial bombing missions and how to make them more efficient in weakening the adversary. Part of this effort included a study that indicated that using the B-29 strategic bomber in low-level incendiary attacks would prove much more effective than bombing from high altitude for which it had been designed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassGeneral">General Curtis LeMay</a> agreed and in the final 7 months of the war, the change in tactics devastated the better part of 67 Japanese cities, killing as many as 500,000 and rendering some 5 million more homeless.
</li><li> Another example from WWII was the analysis the RAF performed on aircraft returning from combat. They studied the battle damage sustained by their aircraft, made a graph of the various parts of the aircraft, and resolved to reinforce the areas that seemed to be shot up the most. Then one bright fellow said they had it completely backward. Since those areas were found the most on returning aircraft, it was deduced that they were actually the least critical. Areas that needed reinforcement were actually the areas that were lowest on the graph, as the aircraft receiving damage there did not make it home. This was followed and survivability increased.
<ul><li> The Royal Navy did the same thing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> with their Operations Research department that mathematically concluded that the best size for convoys is bigger than normal. They came to that conclusion after mathematically analyzing U-boat attacks and determined it was the number of naval escorts that meant the most in defense. By enlarging the convoys with that in mind, they could concentrate more escorts to better defend the cargo ships while the U-boats would not be able to sink more ships despite the larger concentration of targets because their offensive resources would still be the same, and now they would have to deal with tougher defenses too.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted by many would-be (and some professional) game designers. Though one can beat a game with math, making a game fun purely on the math is generally unsuccessful.
</li><li> Michael Larson, an ice-cream truck driver who <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHa4f3ebf-M">won $110,237<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck">Press Your Luck</a></em>, by analyzing and memorizing all the patterns and safe points, due to the computer not being truly random.
<ul><li> Similarly, an engineer named Joseph Jaggers in 1873 discovered a roulette wheel in Monte Carlo that was slightly unbalanced, causing some numbers to come up more often. It netted him a few hundred thousand dollars.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman">Richard Feynman</a> told a story of his father reading a book on swimming, and then going into the water and swimming successfully for the first time in his life. This was intended to demonstrate the power of book learning for his children. It worked.
</li><li> In 1994, Canadian computer programmer Daniel Corriveau analyzed the Keno drawn numbers of the Montreal Casino and found buried in the seemingly random results a pattern that allowed him to win $620,000 with a single bet. After a few weeks of inquiry, the casino admitted he had beaten the system fair and square. They gave him a cheque for his winnings and hired him to <em>fix the problem</em> so no one else could pull off what he had just done.
</li><li> Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, according to the film and the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moneyball">Moneyball</a></em>, considered the usual methods of statistical analysis in baseball to be subjective, unreliable, and relics of a 19th century view, preferring to use on-base percentage and slugging percentage, which are cheaper on the open market than the traditional indicators. How successful was it? "Moneyball" is now a slang term in baseball, and Beane is depicted in the movie by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>.
</li><li> The crew of HMS <em>Venturer</em> during WWII - <em>Venturer</em> is the only submarine ever to sink another submarine while both boats were submerged. Not so impressive in modern subs, which are designed to do this, and the only reason it hasn't happened again is that (thank God) a major war hasn't broken out yet. But in a WWII sub, having calculated (i.e, with paper and pencils) a firing solution in three dimensions, a feat previously thought impossible in combat conditions? Awesome.
</li><li> This seems to be a very common ability amongst professional gamers. They become so adept at analyzing all of the information that they see that they will predict exactly when and where an enemy will attack. Their sense of what the enemy is doing without any direct information can be pretty astonishing to casual players.
<ul><li> In something of a subversion, inexperienced players are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">usually more random and thus harder to predict. Depending on the game, this can be something of a problem for more experienced gamers</a>.
<ul><li> This weakness does take some of the shine off the genius of the pros, as it shows that their predictive abilities rely on both the inherent constraints of the game (there are so many options available) and the metagame (they mainly study the options that other pros find most advantageous).
</li></ul></li><li> In the field of poker, many of the top players can often tell what kind of hand an opponent has by analyzing their betting patterns. Thus, some can tell you what your hand is to the rank (sometimes even to the suit!) without you even giving them a classic tell.
</li></ul></li><li> According to most (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the man himself</a>) this is what made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Wayne Gretzky</a> so great, despite having admittedly subpar (for an elite level player) physical gifts: he could figure out where the puck was heading on the fly, allowing him to be in optimum position for shots on goal (and helping him avoid incoming defenders looking to clobber him).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> explains, in their article on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20052_5-weapon-myths-you-probably-believe-thanks-to-movies.html">Myths About Weapons,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that snipers essentially use math and physics for their sniping.
<ul><li> Cracked did <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19664_6-counterintuitive-tricks-to-beating-popular-game-shows.html">an article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on how to win game shows that boils down to <em>exactly</em> this trope. Turned out that even beating <em>Jeopardy!</em> - allegedly a game completely based around knowing "obscure" trivia - is not a matter of memorizing every trivial fact ever, but rather, to know which parts of <em>general knowledge</em> trivia you are weak in... and do a bit of really casual reading on <em>just</em> those areas. The man who figured this out, Roger Craig, did so by feeding hundreds of hours' worth of <em>Jeopardy!</em> questions into a computer to put together statistics on the kind of questions you're likely to get asked, and then had it spit it out as a graph. Then he proved his theory was right by using said graph to study and subsequently win the game. Twice. Including beating the one-day record and <em>then</em> winning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">quarter million dollars in the Tournament of Champions</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is partly how the US beat the feared Japanese Zero fighter. This happened when the US military found a nearly intact abandoned Zero fighter in the Aleutians, which was called the Akutan Zero. The US military analyzed every detail about the fighter class to discover its weaknesses and develop better tactics and planes to take the best advantage of them.
<ul><li> In particular, it was discovered that the Zero's controls tended to lock up at high speeds and that even with more engine power the Zero was an inherently slow fighter. As a consequence, the majority of late-war US fighters could simply choose to outrun the Zero and attack at a more fortuitous moment. But what about sluggish early-war fighters, such as the P-40 Warhawk and F4 Wildcat? It turned out that US aircraft could sustain higher speeds than the Zero in a dive, and so amongst other tactics, pilots found that a "boom and zoom" technique - attacking the Zero in pairs, while in a shallow dive, extending away each time - could effectively counter the Zero's superior agility. US pilots only needed to score a few hits on the Zero's thin structure to take it out of the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> Hall of fame baseball player Cal Ripken Jr. was able to be a very good defensive shortstop in his prime, despite his lack of physical speed, because he studied both opposing batters, and his team's own pitchers, to make sure he was always in the optimal position to make the needed play.
</li><li> Greg Maddux was an exceptional control pitcher who had once gone through as many as seventeen seasons with at least fifteen wins. He possessed an immensely good command of his pitches, sported excellent discipline, and knew where to find the strike zone consistently that he rarely gave up walks on opposing hitters. But what really puts him here was his uncanny ability to read players just by studying their body language and their mental capacities to figure out what they were about to do. There's a good reason why one of Maddux's nicknames is "The Professor".
</li><li> Many teachers -even at university level- use the same exam questions for years, sometimes even use the exact same sheet multiple times, even in the same semester. If this exam goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">into circulation</a>, it allows students to pass difficult subjects with only a few hours of studying/memorizing answers.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://soranews24.com/2019/10/12/idol-stalker-figures-out-where-his-target-lives-from-the-reflection-in-her-eyes-in-social-media-photo/">A stalker of a Japanese idol singer tracked down his victim's residence by observing reflections in her eyes, then used photographs showing the position of windows and the angle of incoming sunlight to determine which apartment was hers.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> ADHD/ADD can cause one to develop this way of thinking — it's sometimes seen as both its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">best and worst</a> symptom. On one hand, it compensates for the lower attention span caused by the disorder, and thus lets those who zoned out during an important activity to catch up by analyzing the surroundings. On the other hand, since people with it are always subconsciously absorbing information, it makes it even more difficult to focus on one thing.
