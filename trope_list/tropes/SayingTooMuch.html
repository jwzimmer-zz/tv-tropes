</li><li> In the Alabasta arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Chakka says aloud that the royal guard currently fighting Sir Crocodile have used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a> and will die shortly. Crocodile overhears this, and retreats to a rooftop to watch them die uselessly.
<ul><li> CP9 agent Fukurou, in spite of having a giant zipper over his mouth, tends to blab intel to the enemy. The mission before the Enies Lobby battle was complicated by his jabbering, and the Straw Hats were able to plan their rescue of Robin thanks to his 'hints.'
</li><li> In the Arlong Arc, Nezumi accidentally reveals that he's working for Arlong to prevent Nami from earning enough to fulfill her end of the deal to buy back her village this way. When he and some Marines come to confiscate her treasure stash and they're having trouble finding it, he yells that they're specifically looking for 100 million Berries, the amount that Nami was supposed to give to Arlong (although she is a few million short as of their arrival). Nami immediately realizes that Arlong was the one who informed them.

Raymond Spume yells at Julie Henson for "biting her nails during the show just like (she is) now!" when pulling the murdered Flip out of his costume. It turns out that Sparklestar's (the mascot Raymond plays) back was turned to Julie while she was biting her nails, meaning that Raymond could not have seen her doing it unless <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was wearing his costume backwards, which would enable him to unzip it and stab Flip, who was also wearing it the same way so that he could perform a backflip the same way he did a front flip</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em> gives us Rimi, also known as the Yomi-member Atlantis.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, Nanamine, who is working with a group of online consultants changed the first chapter even though his editor was fine by it. When Kosugi, his editor, asks about it, he says "You might have been satisfied with it, but everyone else wasn't." Kosugi then realizes what's going on and Nanamine shows him his plan.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. L tries to get Light to mention something that only Kira would know, only for Light to know this from the start and carefully avoid saying anything.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> "Little Army" manga, after Chihiro sprains her ankle, the group of herself, Miho and Hitomi needs a driver to get home. At this point, they see Emi, who is on her way home, and who starts to leave, offering to call for help. Miho then points out that, based on some of Emi's earlier statements indicating that she knows German tanks are strong and her identifying the tank type moments before, she knows much about driving a tank, and can drive. Emi sheepishly says that she "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">said something stupid like that without realizing it</a>".

In his talking, he haphazardly mentions that they should get Bulma slapped again to get that boost again, leading to Bulma slapping Goku... before Piccolo realizes something: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">How did Goku know about the incident?</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, Goku had been watching from a distance the whole time.</span>

<ul><li> O.J. Simpson made this mistake while discussing his polygraph test with a reporter. When asked whether he had ever taken a polygraph test, Simpson replies with an emphatic "No." He then goes on to explain how he did go to the police station, did get hooked up to the machine, and watched the needles jump whenever his victims were mentioned.
<div class="indent"><strong>Reporter:</strong> It sounds like you took a polygraph. <br/><strong>Simpson:</strong> YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT POLYGRAPHS!
</div><ul><li> Simpson then goes on to discuss in great detail how he took a polygraph, and why he doesn't believe it "counts" as a "real" polygraph.
</li></ul></li><li> A classic riddle has you as a detective trying to determine which of three people pistol-whipped a man to death. They all know the gun used is in custody. Inevitably, the one who did it is the one who says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">You don't think I beat him, did you</a>?"
<ul><li> That trope happened in reality when a man in Florida vanished shortly <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Shakespeare">after winning millions in the state lottery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The prime suspect was a woman whom he hired to manage his funds but was apparently embezzling them. After the man's body was found, she was again questioned by the police. Afterwards, she called a press conference and tearfully proclaimed her innocence, declaring that she "had been falsely accused of shooting another human being." However, the police had not revealed to anyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">exactly how the man was killed</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">"Balloon Boy" and his family</a> being <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6y6HA65wUg&amp;feature=related">interviewed on the news.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Falcon, why didn't you come when you heard us calling you?"

</li><li> The Japanese organization PRIDE FC used to sell DVDs of their fights months after they'd happened with English commentary dubbed in. The commentators would pretend to be watching the fights live. This came apart during an infamous incident in which the play-by-play man forgot what was going on and began telling his partner an amusing anecdote...about the fight they were calling. Written about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-outstanding-taunts-done-during-mma-fights/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Seanbaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Seanbaby">Seanbaby</a> (#4 in the list).
</li><li> A similar incident happened on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>. While commenting on one of the performances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulaAbdul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulaAbdul">Paula Abdul</a> accidentally gave her critique of a song which hasn't been performed yet, revealing that the judges sometimes write their critiques beforehand, based on the contestants' dress rehearsals.
</li><li> A British farmer and his son were murdered early in the reign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a>. His daughter and a servant girl, who were wounded but survived, recognized the masked attacker as another neighbor and farmer who owed a mortgage to the victims, James Blomfield Rush, because of his portly constitution and characteristic gait. At the trial Rush declined a court-appointed lawyer and opted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">defend himself</a>, calling five "witnesses" that claimed they saw the attacker the night of the murder but did not identify him as Rush. When one said that she passed "within a few feet" of the masked attacker, Rush absent-mindedly asked "Did you pass <em>me</em> quickly?" The jury returned a guilty verdict in ten minutes.
</li><li> The 1962 US case <em>Nance v. United States</em> involved a defendant accused of robbery, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">chose to ask his own questions</a> at the preliminary hearing. On cross-examination of the key witness, he asked "How do you know it was me when I had a handkerchief over my face?"
</li><li> In September 2015, Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy announced his intentions to become Speaker of the House. But in one interview, while explaining why he'd be qualified, he inadvertently explained that the numerous hearings on the 2012 attack at the US embassy in Benghazi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Libya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Libya">Libya</a> were primarily a preemptive attack against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Clinton's</a> 2016 presidential campaign, causing much outrage on both sides of the aisle: Democrats<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0aejv');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0aejv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0aejv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and to give credit where it's due, some Republicans</span>, who already had suspicions in that direction, were outraged that the Republicans actually <em>were</em> using the deaths of four Americans as a cheap political stunt, and Republicans were outraged because nobody from their side was supposed to admit what they were doing. McCarthy dropped his bid in October.
</li><li> President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has an unfortunate habit of bragging about information that <em>should</em> be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseLips">top secret</a> (e.g. the "Super Duper Missile", which may very well be an existing prototype), much to the consternation of his aides and Generals.
</li><li> The original suspect in the 2011 murder of Topeka, Kansas resident Sheila Hachmeister was a mysterious internet boyfriend she had who had been pressuring her to send nudes and partake in BDSM, but could not be found, and likely used a fake profile to chat with her. However, Sheila's son, Jason, made himself the new suspect when he bizarrely insisted that he had never touched the rope used to kill his mother, even though 1) he found the body, told emergency services that Sheila had a rope around her neck, and the dispatcher told him to <em>remove the rope</em>; and 2), his DNA was found on the rope. When pressed about the evidence, he said he was "not a cruel murderer". Then it surfaced that the night after the murder, he had gone to a strip club, asked for a private dance, and asked the stripper how it felt to dance for "a cruel murderer".
</li><li> An amusing (for fuzzy values of amusing) incident happened when Stauber/Rampton wrote their book about spin doctors, "Toxic Sludge Is Good For You!". They were pondering about a tacky title and came up with this one. About ten seconds later (spin doctors know more than the NSA) the PR guys from the Toxic Sludge Dept. stormed their office to convince them that toxic sludge is indeed good for you, alerting them there was even much more of a stink going on than they already knew.
