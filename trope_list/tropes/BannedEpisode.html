<ul><li> Episodes 44, 45, and 46 were removed from the rotation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> once the show came under the jurisdiction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Jetix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Jetix">Jetix</a>. They involve Ken and several other local children being abducted and Ken's teammates (most of whom are between the ages of eight and eleven) chasing the villains' truck overnight to rescue them. The episodes are still available as part of the season DVD set and on streaming services.
</li><li> Back when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> first aired in Japan, the censors pulled the 26th and final episode of the series due to its offensive content (pedophilia, excessive bloodshed, and frontal nudity). The odd thing is that the creators <em>wanted</em> the episode to be so raunchy that it would get banned.
<ul><li> Even if a network had been willing to air it, the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> deliberately runs too long. It <em>can't</em> be aired in a standard time slot without cuts.
</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em> has been banned for copyright reasons, as many of the parodies shown in the episode infringe on other manga. Episode 3 had an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman">Anpanman</a></em> parody removed from it due to complaints from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, and to compensate a new episode was animated and put on the video releases and reruns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>'s 23rd episode, "Hot Springs Planet Tenrei", was skipped during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> run due to excessive sexual innuendo and scenes of female nudity. When the show was first rerun on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>, which may have allowed the content, the network decided to show the same edited Toonami version and as such did not air the episode. It wasn't until <em>2018</em> that the episode was broadcast on American television, albeit with a TV-MA rating and some minor censorship. The episode <em>did</em> air in the UK, but in a truncated form that was several minutes short. The DVD releases contain the uncut version.
</li><li> The series premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, which has Megatron smash through a skyscraper similar to the World Trade Center, was pulled from US airwaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">due to the 9/11 attacks</a>, three days after it aired.
<ul><li> To say the series was greatly affected by 9/11 during its original American run is an understatement. Making it worse is that the series' English dub has never been released on home video, as Disney technically owns the rights to the series, and is seemingly withholding it from release to deny Hasbro a source of revenue, meaning fans have to resort to YouTube or cartoon streaming sites to see the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan">Sazae-san</a></em> had an instance of a Banned Segment. The show originally ended with a short animation of Sazae throwing a bean or mochi rice cake and catching it in her mouth. After complaints from parents that their children tried to imitate this segment and choked doing so were sent in, it was replaced with a rock-paper-scissors match.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em> issue #141, "Shoot", was based on a school shooting. It was about to be printed when the Columbine massacre happened... The issue was eventually published as a special in 2010.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomorrowStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomorrowStories">Tomorrow Stories</a></em> was intended to have a Cobweb "story" which consisted of Cobweb narrating a comic biography of the real-world rocket scientist and occultist Jack Parsons. DC refused to print it because it described the alleged involvement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> in ritual magic and questionable financial dealings in the years before he founded the Church of Scientology, which they feared would get them in trouble with the Scientologists. The item was eventually printed in a Top Shelf anthology called <em>Top Shelf Asks The Big Questions</em>, with the Cobweb <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment">transparently renamed</a> as La Toile, a French translation that had already been used in the main series as the alias of an earlier Cobweb who lived in France. However, the incident heavily contributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s second break with DC.

<ul><li> A strip from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy">Get Fuzzy</a></em> drew in plenty of controversy, because of supposed implications that Boston TV and radio sportscaster Bob Lobel is an alcoholic. While some newspapers had a "censored" version published by replacing Lobel's name with a simple "him", the strip is excluded entirely in subsequent <em>Get Fuzzy</em> collection and treasury books.
</li><li> King Features refused to run a series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> strips drawn by Bobby London (the strip's artist at the time) in that it entailed Olive trying to return a "Cabbage Patch Bluto". It was construed as a metaphor for abortion.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> strip where Calvin tries to take a bath in the washing machine was removed from newspapers and isn't included in the paperback collections, presumably because parents didn't want their kids imitating the act.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals">The Little Rascals</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several episodes have been withheld from all syndication rerun packages since 1971, mostly for heavy black stereotyping. The banned list includes the following shorts:
<ul><li> "Lazy Days" (1929)  Depicts young African-American Farina as stereotypically — and exaggeratedly — lazy.
</li><li> "Moan &amp; Groan, Inc." (1929)  Features comedian Max Davidson, well known for playing an exaggerated Jewish American stereotype.
</li><li> "A Tough Winter" (1930)  Features comedian Stepin Fetchit, well known for playing an exaggerated African-American stereotype.
</li><li> "Little Daddy" (1931)  Supposedly banned because the story involves African-American kids Farina and Stymie living on their own while their father is in jail.
</li><li> "Big Ears" (1931)  Wheezer's parents threaten to get a divorce.
</li><li> "A Lad an' a Lamp" (1932)  The kids believe that Stymie's younger brother has turned into a monkey.
</li><li> "The Kid from Borneo" (1933)  The kids mistake a black "wild man" for their uncle.
</li></ul></li><li> The first Little Rascals sound short, "Small Talk", was removed from the package sometime in the 1980s, supposedly due to concerns about its length and sound quality. The second sound short, "Railroadin'", has never been shown on television, as its soundtrack was lost when the TV package was initially sold. Some stations reportedly didn't run "The First Seven Years", supposedly because it featured a violent swordfight sequence.
</li><li> For some time, the MGM "Little Rascals" package removed all of the episodes featuring the character Butch due to a lawsuit filed by actor Tommy Bond for using his likeness without his permission.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>: During a period of time in the 1970s, several TV stations across the US banned <em>They Stooge to Conga</em> (1943) due to its extreme violent nature throughout the film (indeed, Jules White considered it the peak of the series' violence, with such acts as a climbing spike being jammed into Moe's eye, scalp, and ear, Moe using a blow torch on Curly's butt in revenge, a wooden post hitting Moe in the neck and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">actually injuring him</a>, and Curly being charged up "light a lightbulb" and being shorted with a hammer and a lightbulb), and <em>The Yoke's on Me</em> (1944) due to its mistreating racial views towards Asian Americans when several Japanese Men escape from a relocation center and all of them would later be killed after Curly throws an egg-shaped grenade at them at the end of the film. Some stations also refused to air shorts featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthnicScrappy">African-American supporting actor Dudley Dickerson</a>.
</li><li> After film producer and co-founder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Miramax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Miramax">Miramax</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a> Harvey Weinstein was accused and later convicted of sexual assault and rape, many TV channels refused to broadcast the vast majority of his films, particularly from the latter company, he produced because of this.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">Hunger Games</a></em> trilogy includes an in-universe example. The Fiftieth Hunger Games (won by District 12's Haymitch Abernathy) were never televised again after their initial run, though Katniss wonders if they might have been repeated before she was old enough to remember. However, when she and Peeta finally get to watch Haymitch's Games (the tapes of all the other living victors were sent to them as part of their preparations for the third Quarter Quell) they learn that he won by using the force-field around the arena to deflect an axe back at his final opponent. Since tributes are not supposed to know about the force-field, much less use it as a weapon, this was seen as an act of rebellion which not only led to the Fiftieth Games being pulled from the schedules but also led to serious repercussions for Haymitch.

This was considered as in extremely poor taste even at the time of broadcast (1981) and most if not all contemporary repeats either omit this episode or cut this section.
</li><li> Possibly the second episode of season four, "Top Hat and Tails". This is most commonly described as a lost episode that was misplaced and rediscovered, but at least one PBS airing in the US described it as a banned episode, possibly because of a dance contest scene depicting two men dancing.

It has subsequently been reported that just about all the <em>Buffy</em> creators and cast agreed with pulling "Earshot", as it dealt with a (foreseen) mundane school shooting, but the cancellation of "Graduation Day" was seen as much less justified, due to the fantastic nature of a high school's entire student body battling the town mayor, a black magician who had turned himself into a giant snake.

To address this issue, Disney Channel posted on their Facebook page: "We are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character's diet." The episode eventually aired on July 5, 2013, as part of a 2-episode spectacular. The episode was edited and revised, removing any mention of Stuart's gluten allergies.

It finally premiered on FX in June 2002 and has been airing on cable syndication ever since (TBS has aired it), though the episode did air overseas and was released on two DVDs: a compilation of <em>Married With Children</em>'s most outrageous episodes and the complete third season set.
</li><li> The revival TV Game Show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em> in which it was called Password Plus in 1979 had one episode (The first episode of the Elaine Joyce and George Peppard week) pulled from airing on NBC during the show's original run at the time. The reason for the episode's pulling, it was due George Peppard started a rant about network's standards and practices enacted on game shows (which had been enacted on all television game shows as a result of quiz show rigging scandals in The '50s), comparing them to a "police state". It also didn't help that one of the puzzles used "Suck" and "Blow" as clues. Goodson-Todman banned Peppard from appearing on any of their game shows ever again for that incident, which cost them a lot of money. It's also especially regrettable as the pulled episode contain a win in the alphabetics round right at the start of the show. Unlike other game shows however where they replace an episode with a re-run, NBC moved up the remainder of that week shows by one day which aired from June 11-14 1979 with announcer Gene Wood reading the following on the June 11 episode "The program originally schedule for air at this time will not be seen". The week after that, with Sarah Purcell &amp; Bill Anderson, ran for 5 episodes from June 15, 18-21, 1979. To make up for the skipped episode, 6 shows were taped with Judy Norton Taylor and Robert Walden and it aired from June 22-29th 1979. The unaired episode wouldn't see the light of day until Game Show Network aired it in 1999, 20 years later.

Some say the ban also encompasses episodes that feature model Holly Hallstrom (roughly, those episodes airing from 1977-1995) due to various disputes in which she sided against Barker.

The episode was banned because one of the two protagonists, Bodie, repeatedly expressed extremely racist views himself (which were not endorsed by the plot), and also perhaps because, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in a final shock twist, the evil landlord behind the Klansmen, and some of the hooded Klansmen themselves, turned out to be black</span>.

As of 2010, certain local markets across the country had placed the episode back into their packages; but as of 2012, the episode is now back permanently in the syndication package (Kramer's line, "It's like this every day in Puerto Rico" is absent, though it could be a case of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">Edited for Syndication</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>, of all shows, even has its share of these:
<ul><li> From the show's 33rd season, one episode dealt with Telly receiving a visit from his bully cousin, who essentially swipes all of his triangles away from him; Telly, naturally, wants his triangles back, but fears that it will cause a fight between him and his cousin Izzy  we are even treated to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> where Telly and Izzy do get into a physical scuffle, and we even see both of them lying in hospital beds, all bandaged up and in casts. Kids watching were apparently more entertained by the humorous fight between Telly and Izzy, rather than responding to the episode's actual anti-bullying message, to the point that Sesame Workshop removed the episode, and as such, it didn't appear again on PBS during that year's summer repeats, and the character of Izzy was retired. The episode did appear on the resource video "You Can Ask!", but with the fight scene omitted.
</li><li> One episode was banned before it even made it to air: Sometime in the early 1990s, an episode was taped where the subject of divorce was tackled, in a plot where Snuffy and his baby sister Alice now live in a "broken home", since their parents had gotten divorced. <em>Sesame Street</em> often pre-screens episodes with focus groups of children, to make sure they grasp a message or educational concept before the episode is approved for airing. However, the kids in the test audiences were so emotionally distraught over the episode that it never saw the light of day on PBS, and to this day, remains unaired.
</li><li> Another 1970s episode had Margaret Hamilton reprising her role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">the Wicked Witch of the West</a>, which only aired once and was banned for being too scary. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9MFOgTvRso">A few scenes towards the end of the episode have popped up online.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

"Party It Up" later aired without the anorexia joke while the <em>So Random</em> episode that also had jokes about eating disorders seems to have been indefinitely shelved, showing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Disney may have lost their appetite</a> for these jokes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em> had "The Mayor Runs For Re-Election" pulled from rotation permanently because the episode featured a Richard Nixon impersonator, and many PBS affiliates aired the first re-run of the episode on the day his funeral took place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonOfTheBeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonOfTheBeach">Son of the Beach</a></em> episode "Chip's a Goy!" only aired twice in the summer of 2001 before being banned after the 9/11 attacks, due to the fact that the episode involved an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> called Osama bin Layden. The episode can still be found on DVD (where it's stated to be "Never Before Seen").
</li><li> When the BBC first aired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, it refused to air "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E10PlatosStepchildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E10PlatosStepchildren">Plato's Stepchildren</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E12TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E12TheEmpath">The Empath</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E14WhomGodsDestroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E14WhomGodsDestroy">Whom Gods Destroy</a>" for several years<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4aftq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4aftq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4aftq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the series began its British run in 1969, and those episodes weren't shown on the BBC until the <em>1990s</em>!</span> (and also refused to repeat "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E8Miri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E8Miri">Miri</a>" after its initial UK broadcast) on the grounds of those episodes being "unsuitable for children". Never mind the fact that the series as a whole was never supposed to be "for children" (at least in America).On the BBC was shown in its original run in an early evening or late afternoon slot.
<ul><li> In Germany, the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E21PatternsOfForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E21PatternsOfForce">Patterns of Force</a>" was banned due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">heavy references to Nazism</a>. (The episode features an alien culture who are in-universe explicitly imitating the Third Reich, rather than the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">evil culture who just happen to have a suspicious resemblance to Nazi Germany</a>.)

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops">Top of the Pops</a></em>: A sizeable chunk (mainly episodes that aired between 1964 and 1984) of the run of this weekly countdown series will likely never air again due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a>, one of the show's hosts (and arguably the face of its early days), posthumously being outed as a sexual predator whose victims were primarily (albeit not exclusively) teenagers  if it does air, it's only in short clips with the audience blurred out to protect the identities of possible victims. However, clips of Savile that were uploaded to various video-sharing sites before his death and the revelation of his criminal activities remain, and TV specials have aired performance footage from the Savile era that does <em><strong>not</strong></em> feature him on camera.
<ul><li> Also banned (at least from BBC Four repeats) are episodes featuring rocker and convicted pedophile Gary Glitter (who, in addition to making several appearances as an artist, mostly in the first half of the 1970s, was a guest host in the 1990s), as well as episodes hosted by Savile's co-worker Dave Lee Travis. Both were arrested and convicted for sexual offences in the wake of the Savile scandal, though, since Glitter's criminal activities first came to light around the turn of the Millennium, it's likely that the episodes he hosted would have been banned anyway. An episode from 1977 which features a performance by Glitter was repeated, but this was before news of the scandal broke. However, the ban only applies to episodes in which at least one of the three appears. Episodes where they are mentioned in passing (including those where Glitter is part of the chart countdown for that week) are unaffected, as are episodes featuring cover versions of Glitter's songs.
</li><li> <em>Jim'll Fix It</em>, a show whose premise was having the wishes of kids granted via Savile, was banned outright following the revelations. Interviews with the man before his death suggest  in hindsight  that he only did the show so he could be close to his targets. This includes the skit/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> crossover "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho1985JFIGSAFixWithSontarans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho1985JFIGSAFixWithSontarans">A Fix With Sontarans</a>" once offered on DVDs containing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors">The Two Doctors</a>". When the DVD was re-released in 2014, the skit was pulled.
</li><li> It can be assumed that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> episode starring Rolf Harris as host will no longer air due to him being found guilty of indecent assault via the Operation Yewtree investigations that the Savile revelations spurred.
</li><li> Similarly, the comedy team sport show <em>It's a Knock-Out!</em> is unlikely to ever be repeated due to the sex offence convictions of its long-term presenter Stuart Hall.
</li></ul></li><li> When Me-TV reran the Western <em>Trackdown</em> in 2019, they refused to air the episode "The End of the World," about a snake-oil salesman named Trump who vows to build a wall...
</li><li> Related to the above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tweenies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tweenies">Tweenies</a></em> once had an episode, "Favourite Songs", where Max impersonated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a> as part of the "Tweenie Chart Countdown", which featured the titular characters singing, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">their favourite songs</a>. The episode first aired in 2001  well before the allegations gained nationwide attention. The BBC actually missed this episode when initially pulling Jimmy Savile related material from programming  it aired in January 2013 on their preschool subchannel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies">CBeebies</a> mere days after the Metropolitan Police put out a report effectively confirming the worst about Savile. The BBC, already doing damage control after allegations emerged that the BBC under-acted in regards to initial complaints against Savile, promptly apologised and locked the episode away.

This episode was also omitted from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory">Shout! Factory</a> DVD release.
<ul><li> The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster also meant that episode 26, or "Super Weapon R-1" (also known as "The 8,000 Megaton Mistake"), is banned from the Japanese airwaves due to a scene where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> destroys a nuclear power plant through a tsunami caused by it landing in the ocean.

When the WWE had its Classics On Demand service, for example, the War Games 1997 match was not on the list of viewable War Games matches because of Benoit's involvement. It got to the point where many fans were willing to at least let WWE acknowledge his existence. The Benoit footage was reinstated when the WWE launched the WWE Network, but with the same warning that they usually show before a program that might contain any aspect of its "Attitude Era".

<ul><li> <strong>Warner Bros.</strong>: In addition to "All This and Rabbit Stew" above, 12 other Bugs Bunny cartoons were skipped during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s 2001 June Bugs marathon that promised a chronological airing of all of the rabbit's shorts. Nearly all of these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartimeCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartimeCartoon">wartime cartoons</a>, the best known of which are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TokioJokio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TokioJokio">Tokio Jokio</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunnyNipsTheNips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunnyNipsTheNips">Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips</a></em>

</li><li> <strong>MGM</strong>: A few of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery">Tex Avery</a>'s post-WB shorts are banned, like "Uncle Tom's Cabana" and "Half-Pint Pygmy". There are also two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> shorts that aren't on DVD: "Mouse Cleaning" and "Casanova Cat." Edited versions of these two are allegedly still aired occasionally.

<ul><li> "Mass Transit Trouble" had Dr. Robotnik plotting to disrupt the Mobius transportation system by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">planting time bombs in several transit hubs around the planet</a>. Its unusually terroristic undertones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">led to it being pulled twice from circulation</a>, the first time by USA Network and local stations following the Oklahoma City bombing, and the second time by Toon Disney following 9/11. Since the episode was also blacklisted from VHS releases, it could only be uncovered through home video recordings of the episode, until it was finally released on DVD.
</li><li> Similarly, Toon Disney pulled the episode "Magnificent Sonic" after the Columbine massacre due to repeated wielding of guns throughout the episode.
</li><li> "Robo-Ninjas" was skipped over by Toon Disney during their run of the show for unexplained reasons, though the Kwai Chang Crane character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">stereotypical Asian accent and mannerisms</a> may have caused Toon Disney's censors to cringe. Like "Mass Transit Trouble", it only returned to circulation when it was released on DVD (it <em>did</em> air on USA Network, though).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> episodes "The Great MacGrady" and "Room to Ride/The Frensky Family Fiasco", got pulled due to the Lance Armstrong doping incident, but the former was brought back for season 24.
<ul><li> The <em>Arthur</em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostcardsFromBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostcardsFromBuster">Postcards from Buster</a></em> had an episode titled "Sugartime!" that some PBS affiliates refused to screen as it involves Buster visiting a child in Vermont <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">with lesbian parents</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5nx51');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5nx51" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5nx51');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Which, by the way, was only barely stated in a brief scene of the episode where the child describes her family, this being a time of less acceptance for same-sex marriage on the U.S.</span>. The controversy surrounding the episode might also have compelled then-CEO of PBS Pat Mitchell to resign the following year. Ironically, 14 years later, <em>Arthur</em> itself would feature an actual same-sex marriage....and then <em>that</em> episode ("Mr. Ratburn And The Special Someone") got banned by Alabama Public Television, along with its sister episode, "The Feud". It was pre-empted by a rerun on the day of its premiere.

The episode eventually did air in the U.S. with part of the sequence removed (Black Canary wiggling her finger while singing about Aquaman's "little fish") and it also aired in Australia, and the infamous part has appeared on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em> third-season opener "Comedians" featured Beavis trying to juggle flaming newspapers and burning down a comedy club. Because it aired only a month before the Ohio mobile home fire that claimed the life of a two-year-old girl that <em>Beavis and Butt-Head</em> were blamed for, this episode was swiftly pulled out of rotation and later heavily censored.
<ul><li> Other <em>Beavis and Butt-Head</em> episodes that were banned (some of which did return from being banned with content cuts made) for instances of Beavis saying "Fire! Fire!" or flicking a lighter ("Stewart's House", "Kidnapped"), animal cruelty ("Frog Baseball", "Washing the Dog"), inhalant and drug abuse ("Home Improvement", "Way Down Mexico Way") or anything that these days would be considered in extremely poor taste in the aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">September 11th</a> ("Heroes", "Incognito"). Many of these episodes have aired on Viacom-owned networks overseas unedited.

<ul><li> The two-part Season 2 finale, "The Hunger Strike" and "The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show", which openly and viciously lampooned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BET">BET</a>, were removed due to legal threats from BET and its parent company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Viacom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Viacom">Viacom</a>.
<ul><li> These two episodes finally premiered on [adult swim] on May 29, 2020, during a <em>Boondocks</em> marathon. They are now available on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a> completely uncut.
</li></ul></li><li> The Season 3 episodes "The Story of Jimmy Rebel" and "Pause" were removed, the former because it was deemed too racist / politically incorrect (which is odd for a show that's already packed with a lot of racial humor), and the latter because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry">Tyler Perry</a> complained about how the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Winston Jerome</a> was a mockery of him.
<ul><li> "Pause" finally reran again on [adult swim] for the first time since 2010, following the BET 2-parter's premiere on the same night. This episode was also made available on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a> completely uncut.
</li></ul></li><li> The entirety of Season 4 has not been rerun on Adult Swim, due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">overwhelmingly negative reception by fans and critics</a>. However, it has not been pulled from Hulu in the United States and is available on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a>.
<ul><li> In 2020, [adult swim] finally started rerunning Season 4 at a 4:00am graveyard slot on Saturdays.

<ul><li> "Conspiracy" and "Inside Job" were also removed from rotation on Disney after 9/11 due to both episodes revolving around terrorist plots.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em> had seven of its episodes banned from PBS for a number of reasons:
<ul><li> "Caillou Walks Around The Block" was banned because Caillou walks around the block by himself with no parental supervision, something that would get his mother arrested.
</li><li> "Caillou Makes a New Friend" was banned due to Jim's bullying of Caillou looking too realistic.
</li><li> "Rosie Bothers Caillou" was banned for a number of reasons, including Caillou talking back to his mother, shoving Rosie out of his room, and Rosie hitting a book against a door. At one point in time, TV.com even stated that Caillou used the book to <em>hit Rosie</em>, but this was obviously untrue. On August 12th, 2013, the ban was lifted when it aired as part of a four-segment episode under the title "Recipe for Fun".
</li><li> "Big Brother Caillou" was banned due to the scene where Caillou pinches Rosie, which isn't as bad as what happens in the book this episode was based on, where instead of pinching Rosie, Caillou <em>bites</em> her.
</li><li> "Caillou's Getting Older" was banned for showing a dead bird on-screen as well as talking about the subject of death and Caillou's worries about getting older.
</li><li> "Caillou's Quarrel," was banned due to Clementine being too bossy and Caillou fighting with her.
</li><li> "Caillou's Crossword" was banned due to the excessive use of the word "stupid."
</li><li> Averted in the case of "Caillou Flies on a Plane", which features Caillou and his dad being invited to the flight deck. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, this scene alone makes this episode dated, though it has not been banned.
</li></ul></li><li> Following Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash, MTV pulled a scheduled rerun of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em> episode "Sex, Lugs and Rock 'n' Roll" in 2001, as the third segment of the episode showed scenes of car crashes and made light of fatal accidents. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7tls8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7tls8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7tls8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the segment itself, Earnhardt wins a deathmatch against Jeff Gordon by crushing Gordon's body with his car, and crushing him to a pulp with his back tire.</span> However, MTV actually brought this episode back from being banned from airing it uncut on March 22, 2003, at 11:00 pm.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence">Clarence</a></em> episode "Straight Illin" only aired once on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> in the US due to massive outcry over its highly disturbing and incredibly gross nature of the episode. It still sees reruns in other countries, however.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em> episode "The Mask" is banned in France due to its higher-than-usual level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> and the implication that two characters are lesbian lovers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken">Cow and Chicken</a></em>: The infamous second-season episode "Buffalo Gals" was quickly pulled after its original broadcast, after a mother wrote in to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> complaining about the obvious lesbian stereotypes (involving really butch-looking female bikers who break into people's houses and literally munch on the carpets) and innuendo (mostly focused on lesbian sex, like the carpet-munching pun and the "pitch and catch" pun). As a result, rerun versions of this particular episode replace the segment with a repeat of the first-season episode "Orthodontic Police"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8c7nb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8c7nb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8c7nb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the episode where The Red Guy is a motorcycle cop who forces everyone in town to wear large, dangerous, elaborate braces</span>. When <em>Cow and Chicken</em> was on Netflix, the episode was removed there as well (though the episode "Comet!" aired as it originally was: with Dad yelling, "Oh, divot!" after hitting the golf ball into the planetarium instead of "Oh..." followed by a clumsy repeat of his line, "Two!").
</li><li> A few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> were banned when the show went into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">bowdlerized</a> reruns on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeenNick">The N</a> from 2002-2006 (the episodes that weren't banned were edited within an inch of their lives. Say what you want about the DVD release of the show, but at least the original content is there, even if the music isn't):
<ul><li> "College Bored": Possibly due to sexual content, as it did feature Quinn being wooed by college boys who think she's their age.
</li><li> "Cafe Disaffecto": Reasons unknown, though Daria's violent spy story, the café being robbed, and Ms. Li not caring about Daria and Jane's decision to deny chocolates to a hypoglycemic woman may have something to do with it.
</li><li> "This Year's Model" for sexual content, the satire on the shallowness and vapidity of the fashion industry, and the part where a mercenary comes to Lawndale High to recruit new members.
</li><li> "I Don't": Sexual content (particularly the scene were Mack and Kevin are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay">mistaken for a gay couple</a> and Quinn flirts with a priest)
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode">Ill</a>" more than likely due to the sub-plot about Jake becoming suspicious of Daria possibly taking drugs after watching a news report on teens and drugs, though it did air one time with the scene of Jake cursing out a driver cut.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">Daria!</a>" for unknown reasons (probably profanity, since Jake does yell, "Goddamnit!" to a Christian family, but most likely the fact that the episode took place during a storm may be insensitive to hurricane victims or maybe, since the episode was a special musical, The N thought no one would take it seriously, since it did get some criticism for not being serious, just like the episode "Depth Takes a Holiday").
</li><li> "Speedtrapped" for unknown reasons. Maybe the censors were uneasy about the scenes of Jane being bullied into giving a female convict a tattoo and Daria and Quinn picking up a hitchhiker.
</li><li> "Just Add Water" for sexual content (Jake and Mr. O'Neill being seduced by Didi and Ms. Barch and Mr. O'Neill making out in the sinking ship), gambling (the entire plot and the substory of Mr. DeMartino and his gambling addiction), and drunkenness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (the captain of the ship drinking while driving the boat).
</li><li> "Murder, She Snored" (the dream episode where Daria is accused of murdering Kevin) due to violence
</li><li> "Fat Like Me": The N thought the idea of Sandi being ostracized for gaining weight hits too close to home to teenage girls that have body image issues.
</li><li> "My Night at Daria's" for strong sexual content. It eventually did air (albeit edited), with commercials declaring it a "lost episode".
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Boxing Daria</a>": The N didn't like the tragic backstory of Daria's parents arguing over her inability to socialize with other kids and how Daria always hid out in a refrigerator box to cope with this problem. Because of this, the last episode (not counting the movie "Is It College Yet?") is "Prize Fighters", since the episode that came before this one is "My Night at Daria's", which was also banned.

However, "Hail to the Chief / Twistory" has been re-aired infrequently on Nicktoons, usually around Election Day. However, "Timmy's 2D House of Horror" may have a lower chance of reairing on its own due to child abuse jokes (Timmy being chained to a doghouse in the rain overnight and not being able to eat breakfast) and the frightening imagery shown through the magic 2-D glasses.

</li><li> As shown in page image above, FOX banned the eighth season episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS8E21PartialTermsOfEndearment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS8E21PartialTermsOfEndearment">Partial Terms of Endearment</a>" because it dealt with abortion. The episode was later released as a DVD-exclusive episode (like "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" did before actually airing on TV) and has aired on most international channels like the UK's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC3</a> (though the international versions are the edited versions that have scenes cut for content and/or time reasons).

The episode has come back from being banned but mostly airs in cable reruns (TBS and CN), on DVD, and on Netflix streaming.
</li><li> Following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a>' death (and the revelation that it was suicide), the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E22FamilyGuyViewerMailTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E22FamilyGuyViewerMailTwo">Family Guy Viewer Mail #2</a>" has been pulled from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> airings due to the second story "Fatman and Robin" (centered on Peter trying to commit suicide after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">cursed to turn everything he touches into Robin Williams</a>). Over in the UK, the BBC banned the episode after they got complaints about airing it on the same day it was revealed that Robin Williams was dead (similar to what happened when they aired the <em>Simpsons</em> episode "A Streetcar Named Marge" around the time that Hurricane Katrina's destruction of New Orleans made the news). Like Turban Cowboy, the episode has since come from being banned, returning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>'s Rotation.
</li><li> The Season 10 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOFSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS10E3ScreamsOFSilenceTheStoryOfBrendaQ">Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q.</a>" was only broadcast once before it was pulled by FOX in 2011 due to its heavy references to domestic violence landed the episode to be criticized by viewers and critics. However, the episode can be seen on DVD and in syndication.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Freeform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Freeform">Freeform</a> picked up the rerun rights to the series (following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s buyout of 20th Century Fox) starting with season 16, they skipped over "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS16E3NannyGoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS16E3NannyGoats">Nanny Goats</a>" due to a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> murders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">Fievel Mousekewitz</a> in an anti-semitic hate crime.

Starting with the show's move to midnights in June 2019, Freeform has aired the episode in its entirety.

In July 2016, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiTEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiTEntertainment">HiT Entertainment</a> withdrew episode 7 of Season 9, "Troubled Waters", as it featured a scene where Elvis slips over a piece of paper while holding a tray of tea. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>, the paper is showing <em><strong><a class="urllink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/26/19/369CA3BA00000578-3709281-image-a-8_1469557205964.jpg">verses 13-26 of chapter 69 of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></strong></em> <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a></strong></em>. For context, wilfully or negligently damaging any physical copy of the Quran is considered an act of sacrilege in Islam, so having a page from it just lying around to be trodden on like that would be taken as a major insult. HiT later stated that they would no longer be working with Xing Xing, the animation company that inserted the controversial image. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">The episode was later removed from Channel 5's on-demand service, so good luck trying to find it online</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> episode "Deadly Force" was removed from rotation for a while, then re-aired with the scene of Broadway accidentally shooting Elisa with her own gun edited to remove the blood around Eliza's body. What makes this especially odd is the fact that the episode actually showed guns as being dangerous, but not in the clichéd "Guns are dangerous and should never be handled at all" way, but in the more down-to-earth "Guns are only dangerous if you don't know how to handle them. If you use a gun, always unload it when not in use and keep it away from anyone who could mistake it for a toy" way, which American television (whether for kids or adults) doesn't do all that often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HighSchoolUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HighSchoolUSA">High School U.S.A.</a></em>: Two episodes, "Sexting" and "Best Friends Forever" are banned from syndication; "Sexting" for the frequent use of strong sexual slang and the nudity (though most of it is censored), and "Best Friends Forever" for the ending scene in which the gang make a porn film together (though you don't see anything too risque, the cast are all underage). While "Sexting" did get two airings on American TV with a TV-MA rating and was made available on the official website, "Best Friends Forever" was only available for Hulu subscribers, but has since expired, leaving the only way to see the episode being through illegal downloading.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> episode "Door to Door" (and its companion episode "FBI Warning of Doom") was originally scheduled to air on September 14, 2001, but was removed from the schedule following the 9/11 attacks. The episode included a scene where alien spaceships are destroying a city resembling New York with the Statue of Liberty sinking in the background. A new scene was made to replace this one and remove any New York imagery (although the new scene is arguably even more violent), and the episode finally premiered on March 29, 2002. However, the uncut version of the episode was broadcast by mistake instead of the new version. All reruns of the episode have featured the new scene instead, as do all home video and online releases.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> episode "The Big Drip" never aired in America, because Disney found the content (which centered around Jimmy having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Potty Emergency</a>) "inappropriate".
</li><li> The rerun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em> episode "I Just Don't Get It'" was banned on Nicktoons TV in the early 2000s, due to the <em>Action League Now!</em> short <em>Caged Thunder</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1441fy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1441fy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1441fy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The Mayor wanted to destroy the Capitol Building in Washington DC.

</li><li> The eighth episode of the first season of Canadian cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KevinSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KevinSpencer">Kevin Spencer</a></em> was only broadcast once, after a viewer wrote an angry letter to the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) over the episode's content, which included Kevin and his dad robbing a church and hurling snowballs at the congregation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> episode "Leanne's Saga" was banned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sky1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sky1">Sky1</a> Television in the U.K. due to its depictions of domestic violence.
<ul><li> Additionally, the episodes "Propane Boom" and "Death of A Propane Salesman" were temporarily banned after 9/11, due to their plots revolving around Megalo-Mart blowing up.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittlePrincess">Little Princess</a></em> episode "I Want to be a Baby" is for some reason not available on DVD, even on the so-called complete series boxsets. This is weird as the episode is still available over Channel 5's On-Demand site.
</li><li> When the animated adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask">The Mask</a></em> aired on FOX Family (before it was changed to ABC Family and then Freeform, but after it was known as simply The Family Channel), the season two episode "Flight as a Feather" was skipped over due to the infamous sequence in which the mayor's psycho stripper ex-girlfriend Cookie BaBoom crashes an outdoor ceremony and threatens to kill herself and the mayor with dynamite strapped to her naked body, only for The Mask to strip her and use her nudity to distract Kellaway and Doyle.
<ul><li> Taken to extremes on CBS, which only aired seasons one and three of <em>The Mask</em> while season two (the season that has "Flight as a Feather" on as an episode) was put in syndication (mostly on affiliate stations that once ran The WB or UPN) and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> and Boomerang channels overseas (some of which also banned "Flight as a Feather" due to content).

<ul><li> It should be noted that the episode in question aired back in 2012, meaning that it took <em>five years</em> for someone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">notice the wiener that slipped by</a>. It's also worth noting that the series is a France/Germany co-production, who are more relaxed with sexual images unlike America, though that didn't stop the producers from having to do <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-childrens-show-producer-says-penis-drawing-was-very-bad-joke-one-artist-1042147">damage control<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Oh,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">and Maya is not a Netflix original</a> contrary to what some news outlets claim.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mickey MouseWorks short "Minnie Takes Care of Pluto" was banned because it involved the disturbing premise of Pluto having the paranoid belief that Minnie planned to kill him and also had a scene where Pluto dreamed that he was in Hell. As a result, it is one of the only MouseWorks shorts to never be recycled as part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em>.

It did accidentally air on the feed of Nick Jr. Australia gets (which is the same as the Asian feed) before a parent complained about it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> episode "Ready for the Bettys" was pulled from reruns between 2009 and 2015 due to legal issues with a real-life band called The Bettys that the writers were unaware of at the time. As a side effect, "Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown" was pulled due to featuring that episode's song in the #10 spot, and "The Flying Fishmonger" was pulled due to being paired with "Ready for the Bettys".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu">Pingu</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Pingu's Lavatory Story" was banned in multiple countries after its original Swiss broadcast resulted in multiple viewer complaints about the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyFailure">urinating on the floor on-screen</a>, as well as references to alcohol addiction. It wasn't even aired at all in the United States until Amazon Prime picked up the series, which showed the original show in its entirety. It was because of the complaints that "Pingu at the Doctor's" became a second season episode, rather than a first season one.
</li><li> "Pingu at the Doctor's" was itself banned in some countries due to Pingu's beak bleeding. It <em>did</em> air in the US, but wasn't released on home video.
</li><li> The pilot episode was taken off rotation on the BBC in 2003 due to the scene where Pingu violently smacks Pingu in the head, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">censored</a> in most home video releases there. It was also a reason why the Sprout channel in the US didn't pick up the episode (though it aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s <em>Small World</em> block almost a decade earlier, with the scene intact).
</li><li> "Pingu Quarrels With His Mother" was rejected by Sprout due to the scene where Pingu's mother slaps him in the face for insubordination, though Cartoon Network aired it uncut. In the UK, the BBC shows the episode with the slap removed. Like the rest of the original series, it's available on Amazon Prime Video uncensored.
</li><li> "Pingu Runs Away" was banned in the United Kingdom after complaints that the frightening monster-shaped ice formations Pingu encounters in the episode scared young children (the episode also had a rather upsetting tone).
</li><li> "Pingu's Dream" aired only once on Sprout before being quickly pulled from the channel due to the horrifyingly ugly appearance of the walrus in Pingu's dream sequence. It had been banned from the BBC years earlier for the same reason.
</li><li> "Pingu and the Doll" is the only episode from season four to be banned in North America due to Pingu exhibiting stereotypical Native American mannerisms throughout the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> pseudo-series finale "See Me, Feel Me, Gnomey" was banned, allegedly due to being about Communism, or the heavy use of strobe effects (which could have triggered epileptic seizures in more sensitive viewers, much like the notorious <em>Pokemon</em> episode "Electric Soldier Porygon"). However, series creator Craig McCracken <a class="urllink" href="http://crackmccraigen.tumblr.com/post/147175691484/a-few-friends-and-i-just-watched-the-apparently">revealed on his Tumblr account<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the real reason the episode got banned was because of what the network perceived as religious imagery — they claimed the metal beams in the destroyed buildings looked too much like crosses, and one of the hippies looked like Jesus. However, the episode can be seen on the complete series DVD set for the show, as well as on digital download and SVOD releases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> had the 1992 episode "Man's Best Friend", which was not aired on Nickelodeon due to the use of the character George Liquor, along with a scene where Ren violently whacks George with an oar repeatedly. This was partly the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> and Spumco were fired from the series, and Nickelodeon Animation Studios took over. It finally did air on TNN/Spike TV as part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpyAdultPartyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpyAdultPartyCartoon">Ren &amp; Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"</a></em> in 2003, and was also included on the first and second-season DVD set from Paramount Home Video in 2004.
<ul><li> The final-season episodes "Sammy and Me" and "The Last Temptation of Ren" originally did not air on Nickelodeon. The former was due to referencing Sammy Davis Jr.'s glass eye (not pleasing the Davis' estate), and the latter was withheld due to controversial religious content. Both eventually aired together on MTV in 1996, and "Sammy and Me" eventually was aired on Nickelodeon in the summer of 2000. "The Last Temptation of Ren" not only never aired on Nickelodeon but never aired on Nicktoons either. It eventually aired 22 years later on NickRewind.

<ul><li> "Leap Frogs" was banned on the grounds of very risque content. The episode centered on Bev Bighead trying to seduce Rocko while her husband is at work, as she feels that she's not being loved by Ed. It did see some airtime at least twice before Nickelodeon realized the risqué content and demanded it to be cut.
</li><li> "Heff in a Handbasket" was pulled after the show's initial run, due to all the references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> and Satanism, in an even more extreme case than "To Heck and Back" did<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18ii9h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18ii9h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18ii9h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The episode involved Heffer trading his soul to Peaches to be on a game show</span>. The episodes that were paired up with these two, "Wallaby on Wheels" and "Bedfellows," were aired together in reruns to still allow for an even number. Oddly, when the show initially began airing on Nicktoons TV, "Leap Frogs" was shown for a while before being pulled again, but "Heff in a Handbasket" remained in circulation until the show was removed from the network. This meant there were two half-hours that included "Wallaby on Wheels" (one with the original "Heff in a Handbasket", and one with "Bedfellows").

However, in a reversal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">Distanced from Current Events</a>, fans protested its removal (since it's one of the most popular episodes of the series) and it was quickly reinstated, albeit with the jokes and scenes centered around the Twin Towers either heavily edited or cut entirely on some local affiliates. Other affiliates (which often retain the tapes for years and air them in any order besides that suggested by Disney-ABC Domestic Television, the syndicator) have shown the episode uncut and uncensored, save for some time cuts and a man's line about how "They stick all the jerks in Tower One." The original uncut episode is on the season nine DVD (with commentary from the writers on how the episode is now in bad taste thanks to 9/11, but it still has its moments that haven't aged, like the Betty Ford rehab musical).

It is later released for the first time on the Season 10 DVD boxset in the latter country, while it still remains banned in the former.
</li><li> The later episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E14NewKidsOnTheBlecch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E14NewKidsOnTheBlecch">"New Kids On The Blecch"</a>, which aired seven months before the 9/11 attacks, was also temporarily pulled, and later edited to remove a scene involving the destruction of a tower (in this case, it was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> headquarters).
</li><li> The episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E2AStreetcarNamedMarge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E2AStreetcarNamedMarge">"A Streetcar Named Marge"</a> was also pulled from syndication after Hurricane Katrina because of its references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans">New Orleans</a> being a horrid, run-down hellhole. The episode also angered residents of New Orleans on original airing, prompting an apology in Bart's chalkboard punishment the following episode.
</li><li> The episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS19E10EPluribusWiggum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS19E10EPluribusWiggum">"E Pluribus Wiggum"</a> caused controversy in Argentina prior to its broadcast there. The controversy is over an exchange between Lenny and Carl. Carl says "I could really go for some kind of military dictator, like Juan Perón. When he 'disappeared' you, you stayed 'disappeared'!". Fox decided not to air the episode in Latin America, except in Brazil. Some national TV networks in the region, Caracol in Colombia, Canal 13 in Chile, Televen in Venezuela, and TV Azteca in Mexico have aired the episode. FOX Latin America finally aired the episode for the first time on September 6, 2016, after 8 years of censorship.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS28E18LookingForMrGoodbart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS28E18LookingForMrGoodbart">Looking For Mr. Goodbart</a>" was banned in Russia for depicting Homer playing a stand-in for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em> in church. Due to the unintentional parallel to a real-life incident where a Russian blogger got in trouble for playing the game in a church in St. Petersburg, the Orthodox Church suspected the episode of being "Hollywood propaganda" seeking to defame their country's society.

Aside from turning up once on FXX that October, it hasn't been rerun anywhere since. The ban apparently extends to Fox international networks (the Latin American channel skipped it when doing a season-per-day marathon of the entire series in May 2019) and definitely applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a>, making this the show's one <em>completely</em> banned episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SoupeOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SoupeOpera">Soupe Opéra</a></em>: Supposedly, the episode with the bat was banned because its wings gave children seizures.

For <em>201</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> censored every mention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">The Prophet Muhammad</a>, as well as Kyle's entire monologue about giving in to fear, while Parker and Stone were not allowed to disclose the details of said monologue <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19up4l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19up4l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19up4l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An authentic-looking uncensored version has since been leaked in which the characters say in an inspirational tone that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">threatening violence is the best route to getting your way</a></span>. The censored content still remain for DVD versions of the episode, and the two episodes never aired on syndication since then. On a related note, although it never stirred controversy when it aired, "Super Best Friends" (which depicts various religious leaders, including the Prophet Muhammad) can no longer be syndicated for similar reasons (though it is on the season five DVD).
<ul><li> The ban on "200"/"201" also extends to several foreign language adaptations of the series. In particular, the director of the French dub had stated that it is highly unlikely they'd be translated due to requiring even more dialogue censorship. Likewise, the scene where Buddha is shown snorting cocaine alongside Jesus looking at pornography, parodying the double standards of which religious figures are and aren't okay to depict, ironically got the episode (and the entire series) banned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SriLanka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SriLanka">Sri Lanka</a>.
</li><li> At least seven episodes have been banned in the Japanese version to date (the dub has yet to get to "200"/"201"):
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS2E1TerranceAndPhilipInNotWithoutMyAnus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS2E1TerranceAndPhilipInNotWithoutMyAnus">Terrance and Phillip in: 'Not Without My Anus</a>" was skipped in the second season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">A Japanese version of the Other Wiki</a> had speculated it was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s appearance, although the popular belief is that the episode got banned because fans didn't like it, as it aired in place of the second part of the season one cliffhanger (the one where Cartman tries to find the identity of his biological father) as a joke, though Trey Parker and Matt Stone have said that this was one of the few episodes from seasons one to three that they don't hate.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E11Chinpokomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E11Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a>" was completely banned (and thus not available on DVD) due to mockery of the Japanese and Emperor Hirohito, including a plot point where the Japanese were brainwashing the children to bomb Pearl Harbor.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E9DoTheHandicappedGoToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS4E9DoTheHandicappedGoToHell">Do The Handicapped Go to Hell?</a>" and "Probably" were not dubbed by WOWOW for season four. While the official reasons were not stated, the popular theory is that the references to Christianity and the Western concepts of the afterlife wouldn't be fully understood by Japanese viewers. The episodes did later make it on to the DVD releases but were left in the original English version with Japanese subtitles.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E12ALadderToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E12ALadderToHeaven">A Ladder to Heaven</a>" was banned when WOWOW began broadcasting of season six, as it contained more mockery of the Japanese and had again included heavy references to Christianity. Despite this, a clip from the episode was retained in their dub of "Casa Bonita".
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E2KrazyKripples" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E2KrazyKripples">Krazy Kripples</a>" was to be aired in the dub of season seven, but was pulled from broadcast due to the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a> (who had been the villain in the episode).
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS9E8TwoDaysBeforeTheDayAfterTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS9E8TwoDaysBeforeTheDayAfterTomorrow">Two Days Before The Day After Tomorrow</a>" was banned in FOX Japan's broadcast of season nine, on the heels of the 2011 tsunami, earthquake, and nuclear disaster. Another part worth noting is that for some reason (perhaps to do with expenses), the entirety of season 9 besides this banned episode was also not dubbed and only broadcast in a subtitled format.
</li></ul></li><li> The Spanish-language dub aired in the Latin American markets has had its own cases of banned episodes. Aside from "200" and "201" (which were already banned for international adaptations and DVD box sets), there are at least eight other cases to date:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E1RainforestSchmainforest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E1RainforestSchmainforest">Rainforest Schmainforest</a>" was banned late in the game in 2011 (several years after it was dubbed), due to its mockery of Costa Rica. A toned-down redub was produced as a way of getting the ban lifted for it to air again.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS9E13FreeWillzyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS9E13FreeWillzyx">Free Willzyx</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS15E9TheLastOfTheMeheecans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS15E9TheLastOfTheMeheecans">The Last of the Meheecans</a>" were initially left completely banned and untranslated due to their mockery of Mexicans, although these bans would wind up lifted for the DVD releases for each season.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS13E6PinewoodDerby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS13E6PinewoodDerby">Pinewood Derby</a>" would have been aired on MTV, but the portrayal of Felipe Calderon (the President of Mexico from 2006 to 2012) wound up getting the episode banned before it was broadcast.
</li><li> A few episodes of season six have been banned by MTV Latinoamerica in reruns of the series (with the season having originally aired on Locomotion). The official reasons remain unstated (though given the episodes banned, it was probably because of content considered too vulgar for broadcast), but the episodes include "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E3FreakStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E3FreakStrike">Freak Strike</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E11ChildAbductionIsNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E11ChildAbductionIsNotFunny">Child Abduction Is Not Funny</a>", "A Ladder To Heaven", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E14TheDeathCampOfTolerance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E14TheDeathCampOfTolerance">The Death Camp of Tolerance</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> The original Italian dub by SEFIT-CDC Group banned and left three season 4 episodes untranslated: "Cartman Joins NAMBLA" (due to Kenny attempting to force an abortion on his mother, as well as references to pedophilia with NAMBLA), "Do The Handicapped Go To Hell?", and "Probably" (both due to mockery of Catholicism and religion in general).
</li><li> Related to the Italian dub above British Satellite Channel Sky1 had pulled the season 4 episode "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", (due to the similar reasons in the Italian Dub above), however the channel had also pulled the season 5 episode Proper Condom Use, (due to its highly sexual and violent content), and the season 6 episode Jared Has Aides, (due to its Aids reference and the ending scene where Butters is beaten up by his parents after Cartman impersonated him and caused an abusive beating by Butters' parents against him), as of 2018 those episodes are still very rarely shown on British Television.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode of the first season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967">the 1967 Spider-Man series</a> titled "The One-Eyed Idol/Fifth Avenue Phantom" is occasionally left out of circulation as it contains a lot of content that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">these days, would be considered racist and sexist</a>.
</li><li> In the United Kingdom, the paired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episodes "Shanghaied" and "Gary Takes A Bath" were banned for several years. "Shanghaied" was banned because of its frightening images (especially a disturbing, surreal sequence where SpongeBob and Patrick are sprayed by perfumes, and Squidward falling through the Fly of Despair) and "Gary Takes A Bath" was banned for three reasons: The inclusion of an inappropriate "don't drop the soap" gag (which refers to prison rape), a scene where SpongeBob deliberately straps a bomb onto himself (which brings suicide bombers to mind and came off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">distancing from current events</a> following the 7/7 London bombings), and a short scene where a very creepy image of a deranged hillbilly girl appears without warning (SpongeBob is even disturbed by this, and apologizes to Gary, as well as presumably the audience). Even today, these two episodes remain controversial and are very rarely shown on British television.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Banagic Incident" was banned in some European countries for unknown reasons. Most guess it's because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> of the episode resembles a self-pleasuring device.
</li><li> In May 2017, "Just Friends" was pulled from Disney XD's schedule and site, most likely due to <a class="urllink" href="https://onemillionmoms.com/current-campaigns/disney-airs-its-first-gay-kiss/">One Million Moms sending the channel a complaint<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about a scene depicting several same-sex couples kissing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episodes such as "The Answer", "Reunited" and "Hit the Diamond" were never allowed to broadcast in Russia and the Middle East due to the presence of same-sex couples. Other episodes containing these themes were not outright banned but heavily edited.
</li><li> Eventually, the ENTIRE SHOW was pulled from air in the Middle East, North Africa, and Kenya.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">2003-2009 series</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> had an episode called "Insane in the Membrane" that never aired on FOX (though it was available on DVD and shown on the former 4KidsTV site). It involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Baxter Stockman</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cloning his old body and inserting his brain inside. It goes fine for a while but after a few months, he begins to fall apart and constantly tries new ways to fix himself including chopping off limbs. Eventually he loses his mind and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">blames April for all that has happened to him</a></span>. To be fair, the episode was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">quite disturbing</a> for kids. It finally aired in the US in 2015 on Nicktoons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em> had an episode pulled by Cartoon Network after it had just finished production and wasn't even scheduled to air yet when 9/11 happened. It was called "Orphan Substitute", which involves the time squad having to briefly help a dim-witted President George W. Bush. According to writer Carlos Ramos, when 9/11 happened the episode was outright banned by the network and was told it would "never air". But it did air eventually, in November of 2003 as the series finale. The creator Dave Wasson stated that the episode was never intended to be the last to end the series, so one would suspect that CN felt that the episode would probably not be too damaging to the company by that point in time, and they probably just needed to fill in that extra timeslot for their "November Premiere" block that was running new episodes leading up to Thanksgiving Weekend.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoon">What A Cartoon</a></em> short "The Kitchen Casanova" was removed from the show later on due to a scene where Casanova accidentally cuts his finger off while trying to cut come carrots.
