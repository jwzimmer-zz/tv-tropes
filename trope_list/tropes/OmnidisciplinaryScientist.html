A writer either didn't do the research or didn't want to. If someone is a scientist, and something about science needs to be known, the scientist will know it or learn it by the end of the episode.
</p><p>Films are particularly bad about this. It's understandable that a producer needs to reduce the number of named characters, so anything "scientific" is handled by the existing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">science guy</a>" character. However, it strains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> when the guy who was just working on the nuclear reactor turns around and is suddenly a xenobiologist, chemist, alien technology expert and computer programmer as well.

The medical variant is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDoc">Super Doc</a>.
</p><p>Compare to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a> who is also very knowledgeable in multiple fields - but not necessarily all of them.

May possess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopaedicKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopaedicKnowledge">Encyclopaedic Knowledge</a> if their interests stray outside of science.
</p><p>Note also that the "plausibility" of this trope is context-dependent. If a story presupposes an immortal character, for example, that character might well have had time to master many disciplines of study (though perhaps not to be up on the latest developments in all areas). Likewise, a non-human mind might be capable of anything, or a future/alien technology might enable learning by means other than the hard way, or the character has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">Super Intelligence</a> as a power. Or, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Doctor</a>, all of the above.

In reality, this usually isn't the case  most developments are incremental and made through the collaboration of many people who each have special knowledge of one small part of the problem. Of course, there are exceptions which make it a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. This is also common with people who take knowledge as a hobby, trying to get as much information as possible instead of specializing in a single discipline (and as gadgeteers usually also encompass being engineers at the same time).
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDoc">Super Doc</a> for the medical version of this. In works of fiction, a doctor is almost always a hybrid between a medical doctor and something else (in the case of omniscience, everything else). In real life, a doctor is a physician with a doctorate of medicine (M.D.), or a Ph.D in any field, regardless of being a practitioner of medicine or not. And it should be stressed that a Ph.D is generally going to have the same fundamental core competencies (at least in theory) for their given field, but beyond that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">most of their knowledge, skills, and abilities is limited to whatever was the subject of their dissertation</a>. Generally speaking, any scientist can probably do basic statistical data analysis. But a dedicated statistician (even if he isn't a practicing scientist per se) is whom you would call for the important jobs where you really need an expert on the numbers.

<ul><li> Subverted with Duelo. He's a medical doctor, so when the crew needs to repair the ship's engine, he admits that he would be of little help. Despite this, his way of thinking about the ship as if it were actually a living organism gives him the idea of creating a power bypass. How exactly he's able to wire the bypass is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Another case with Duelo: despite being a doctor, he was trained on a planet with no women at all and is completely ignorant of female anatomy, so he's at a loss when one of the women on the ship becomes pregnant, and diagnoses her with an "abdominal parasite".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> features a villainous example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Mad Scientist Dr. Hell routinely designed and build <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, complex computing systems, giant flying ships, submarines, all kind of weapons and devices (including a size-changing ray in one episode), cyborgs... He would need being an expert on any field of science to achieve all those scientific breakthroughs and perform all those feats, including physics, engineering, maths, robotics, computing science, cybernetics and medicine. In contrast, Dr. Kabuto and Professor Yumi subverted the trope, being experts on one field and needing help or expert advice in other areas, and using the trial-and-error method to make breakthroughs.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Professor Kenzo Kabuto</span> from the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> was also a subversion, right like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father Juzo Kabuto</span>.
</li><li> On the other hand, Dr. Umon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> played it straight.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a> may be an Omnispecies Omnidisciplinary Doctor: he can perform surgeries and autopsies and deliver babies. And transplant horse brains into humans. And stitch together a child using her parasite twin body parts and plastic. He had even performed surgery on a dog, a whale, a ghost, a computer, an alien, and himself.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime">And he fights crime.</a>
</li><li> Not only did he perform abdominal surgery on himself to remove a parasite, he did so in the middle of the Australian outback, all by himself, while simultaneously fighting off dingoes.
</li><li> This is a pretty common trope in stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>. In his original Metropolis manga, Duke Red not only creates an army of robots, but also a machine that makes artificial sunspots &amp; other weirdness, although he does have to turn to a specialist to get a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a>. Most of the numerous scientist characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> are omnidisciplinary to some degree. Ochanomizu, whose main background is in robotics, also comes up with inventions like a bomb that flash-freezes everything for miles around &amp; even a device that can read minds (although considering he's the head of the Ministry of Science he may have had some help with these). Astro's creator Dr. Tenma is said to be an expert in both Artificial Intelligence &amp; the Human brain, which handily explains why Astro has such a lifelike personality, as Dr. Tenma could draw on his knowledge of neurology to create a computer system that emulates the Human nervous system.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Shiba from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KotetsuJeeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KotetsuJeeg">Kotetsu Jeeg</a></em>. Not only he was an accomplished archaelogist but also he could cure people, make cyborgs, build a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and flying ships, and transferring his mind from his dying corpse to a computer.
</li><li> Washu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>. In most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuities</a> she, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Doctor</a>, is old enough that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>.
<ul><li> For the original OVA, her having knowledge about everything in existence is helped by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she personally had a hand in <em>creating</em> everything in existence...though she's intentionally restricted her memory of that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsNoBigDeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsNoBigDeal">since being omniscient is apparently boring</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of the "Meights" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories">The Five Star Stories</a></em>, scientists who create either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> "Mortar Headds" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> "Fatimas" &amp; in rare cases both, are skilled in other fields as well. This is justified by the fact that they are, like the other super-people in FSS, descended from genetically engineered superhumans. While Headliners get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> &amp; Divers get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, Meights get super intelligence.
</li><li> Watari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em> is unbelievably proficient with hacking and decryption, involved in maintaining the computer-based reality where the series' summoned gods live, and good enough at chemistry for potion-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Science</a>, and he's alluded to having had done other things. His PhD? In Mechanical Engineering.
</li><li> Professor Desty Nova in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em> mastered every practical and theoretical science up to and including nanotechnology before inventing "karmatron dynamics". Which he also makes great progress in.
</li><li> Ritsuko Akagi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. She supervises Nerv HQ's science department and seems to be an expert in everything Project E requires (biology, metaphysical biology, engineering, ordnance...), along with computing, physics, and medical science. Ritsuko is the show's go-to for "voice of expositional scientific and technical authority".
</li><li> Dr. Vegapunk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is described as studying everything from cells to battleships and he came up with many of the technological advances used by the Marines. The guy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution">One-Man Industrial Revolution</a>. If it's a field that involves science, he's studied it, and except for ship building, pioneered it.

However, it is subverted in some aspects, as he admits that while his <em>academic</em> knowledge of many subjects is top notch, his ability to actually put it to use is heavily limited. As an example, he's capable of using chemistry to create glass, but completely incapable of actually making anything useful out of the substance until he convinces an experienced craftsman to do it for him.

In the sequel, he meets a hot female archaeologist who beats him in the number of degrees.
<ul><li> In fact, the plot of the first film is kicked off when he's booted out of the university, where he'd gladly spend the rest of his days studying, so that he'd get some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> experience.

</li><li> Also the captive doctor Yinsen, who manages to build an electromagnet and implant it into Tony's chest. The concept is somewhat simple, but to make a precise and effective one for the exact purpose in the movie, would require something of an expert in electrical engineering. And as any doctor will tell you, there isn't really enough time in your life to get a medical degree as well as expert knowledge in other nearly completely unrelated fields. He admits to seeing the kind of wound Tony has several times in his home village and as a result has had practice in treating it, somehow.

On top of being a munitions expert and engineer, he's also skilled in chemistry (he built chemical weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter">Agent Carter</a></em>), applied physics (Arc Reactor), theoretical physics (discovered the molecular structure of a new element) and biology (he remains the only person <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to successfully recreate Erskine's serum</span>). This on top of running a company <em>and</em> a spy organization. At least Tony restricts himself to engineering, robotics, computers, and physics - though he casually builds a particle accelerator <em>in his house</em> in <em>Iron Man 2</em> and synthesises a whole new element (albeit one that Howard had discovered), and masters nanotechnology. His crowning achievement, though, comes in <em>Endgame</em> where he fairly quickly figures out how to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>build a time machine</em></span>. In general, it's made clear that he's actually smarter than Howard, but he's both more focused (in terms of scientific discipline) and, pre <em>Iron Man</em>, less focused (in terms of personal discipline). After his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, he starts becoming more of this trope.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> he is treating sick people in Calcutta. He is also stated to be the world's top expert in gamma radiation, and Tony Stark compliments him on his research in anti-electron collisions. If he's not an engineer/medical doctor/physicist, he's at least good enough to pass as all of them. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> finally clarifies it: he's a <em>septidesciplinary</em> scientist, having seven PhDs.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>, she also criticizes Bruce's and Tony's work on Vision, pointing out how the Mind Stone could've been connected more efficiently.

To be a real maester you need enough links to form a chain you hang around your neck. Justified by the lower technology setting, and they still won't have links of every metal. Maester Luwin has a link of Valyrian steel that represents that he's studied magic, and notes that only one in a hundred maesters have such a link (mostly because they're also taught magic isn't real, so what's the point). This having been said, the leaders of the Maesters, the Archmaesters, are marked out by their deep mastery of <em>one</em> discipline — they'll have links around their neck of several metals, but they'll have a ring, rod and mask of one and only one metal.

</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> has a single Science skill, making it easier to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience">Weird</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>. It's possible for a character to be specialized in a particular field, but this simply provides a bonus when working in that field; you can work outside this area no problem. A similar system exists in another FATE-based RPG, the RPG adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em>. The Science mode confers <em>every kind of science</em> at its base value, which is justified by the way skills are priced - any given scientific skill has only two applications, and since skills are worth (application -2) points, scientific fields are effectively free. Anyone with Science as their primary mode has a base +3 to everything from geology to quantum physics. Science-primary characters are, however, encouraged to specialise in something to a) differentiate them from every other science-focused character, and b) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRivalry">make it easier to beat the other characters in a Brainstorm, giving the opportunity to gloat</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>. If you have Lore and Occult, you can do Science. Probably justified in the case of older Exalts, who are hundreds or even thousands of years old and have thus had a lot of time to study. <em>Every</em> Exalt is a jack-of-all-trades with regard to any of the 25 abilities.
<ul><li> Of the 25 abilities, Craft is more specialized and broken up into 5 mundane abilities plus several more esoteric ones. Within a Craft an Exalt can make anything it would apply to. Combine Lore and Occult with a Craft and you do Engineering.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> gameline from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> was rife with this, as skills on the character sheet came in broad categories such as "technology", "medicine", "science", "computers" and "academics", specialization optional. The reality-bending technomages on the side of the Nine Traditions could easily slip into this trope, especially the Sons of Ether who embodied the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor">Mad Doctor</a> trope to a T. Strangely, all the awakened super-scientists, engineers, spacepilots, pharmacologists, cybersurgeons and geneticists of the Technocracy were far more specialized and usually stuck to their field of expertise, despite the fact that the Technocracy was All About Science.
<ul><li> It may have had something to do with the fact that the Sons of Ether tended to be loners or at the very least disorganized and thus were encouraged to be at least decent in a little of everything, while the Technocracy is Also All About Organization and had dedicated branches for specific needs.
</li><li> Technically, a storyteller is instructed to require a relevant specialty to build, repair, or analyze something (e.g. to fix a car engine you could justify with craft spec "cars", science spec "engine design", etc). This is why specialties are relatively cheap and bought separately from the skill ranks. This was rarely ENFORCED for mages because the paradigm system usually meant that they could usually declare whatever specialty they had relevant (e.g. take crafts/pastries and the paradigm "everything is secretly a cake". BAM, now your skill focus lets you fix the car, because you see the moist, sugary goodness beneath the lie of spark plugs and pistons.)
</li><li> The Technocracy is explicitly an inversion of the trope. They don't stick to specialties because that's how real science works: real science has various specializations requiring different education and resources because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">the Technocracy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">intentionally made it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">work that way</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati">to keep human imagination under control</a>. The omnidisciplinary version is how it "really" works when they're not hobbling it for everyone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> has the same broad categories as all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a> games, but Geniuses also have the explicit ability to apply their skills to related yet bizarrely inappropriate circumstances. If they learn to drive a car they can use those skills to guide a spaceship through re-entry.
<ul><li> Then again, another of the abilities of a Genius is to spend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mania</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">intuitively understand technology</a>. Given that "technology" is a very broad category, there's a high chance of overlap between those two skills.
</li></ul></li><li> Any character with Science skill in the current edition of the World of Darkness is this by default, as there's only one "Science" skill, just as there's only one "Academics" skill. Even the specialities are extremely broad, such as "Physics" or "Chemistry."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a></em> does divide the sciences into multiple Knowledge skills. However, there are only four of them - behavioral sciences, earth and life sciences, physical sciences, and technology. Under this system, a geologist character will also be an expert on biology. Furthermore, it is easy for a Smart Hero to max out several of these skills and be a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PalladiumBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PalladiumBooks">Palladium Books</a> games have this trope in spades. In the case of the original <em>Rifts</em> book, there's the Rogue Scientist, who can grab any and all science skills in the book. The CAF Scientist in Phaseworld is similar, though he does get to pick one science at a slightly higher bonus as his specialization (as in, his specialization is in one entire scientific field). <em>Heroes Unlimited</em> has other examples, but as the point of that game is to make comic book style superheroes, it's likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">done on purpose</a> in that case.

When adapted to modern terms, he would have been considered a genius in alchemy, biology, several disciplines in art, geology, agriculture, politics, sociology, history, physics, philosophy, magic, law, metaphysics, medicine, and cartography.

His primary field appears to be medicine and biology, which is why he's the go-to guy when they need a doctor.
</li><li> Klaus has made plenty of his own inventions, but he is most famous for understanding how things work, dismantling and reverse-engineering the devices of other Sparks and improving them. Since his entire empire is based simply on conquering anyone who attacks him, this has given him a massive technology base to use. On a more mundane note, this ability is implied to be behind his talent to "find the right monster for the right job."

Her most famous creations are the dingbots, pocket-watch sized clanks that build more of themselves and help her with her work. However, she has also been shown to have skill in every other field, from electricity to guns to cooking.

By the time they recombined, adding all of their accumulated experience and knowledge together, he had earned a legitimate doctorate in every single science... except agricultural science, because that particular clone wasn't able to return. This is unlike the usual case in that usually the scientists <em>show</em> proficiency in any field without explanation, but Dr. McNinja has the explanation but doesn't show his abilities much.

<div class="indent"><strong>Hermes:</strong> Professor, can you wire my brain directly into the main Battle Net?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Professor:</strong> I can wire anything into anything! <em>I'm the Professor</em>!
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, we get "super-science," which is basically this turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that the concept was created in response to this trope's ubiquity in the comic-book/animated television that the show mainly parodies. A super-scientist is a master of every scientific discipline, and capable of basically anything you might see in science fiction. Jonas Venture Sr. was the most talented super-scientist ever, and is connected in some way to almost all technology seen in the show.
<ul><li> His son Rusty, a main character, is a flawed version — a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">Bungling Inventor</a> who is <em>in</em>competent in several fields. His lone talent seems to be in genetics/biology (still in the super-scientist range).
</li><li> Jonas Venture, Jr. plays this a bit straighter, having received several doctorates (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">in a month</a>). And in any case, he thus far appears to have stuck to various forms of machinery.
</li></ul></li><li> Also parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Stan's father, Randy, is a geologist by trade, but is called on by the Mayor to investigate all manner of odd happenings, since aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">crazy geneticist</a> Dr. Mephesto, Randy Marsh is the <em>only</em> scientist living in the entire town. He even lampshades this to the mayor, that his field of study is strictly geology.
<ul><li> At least, early in the show; newer episodes show Randy working in an office full of other geologists, and other scientists have appeared in other episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>. Ron pleads with two kidnapped scientists to find some way to stop a gang of berserk robots, who explain they're both astrophysicists and know nothing of robotics.
<ul><li> And from another episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jim and Tim:</strong> The television's broken! Can't you <em>do</em> something?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mr./Dr. Possible:</strong> Well, I could put it in geosynchronous orbit, but I'm not sure how that would help.
</div></li><li> Played straight with Doctor Drakken. A physicist by trade (specialising in robotics), he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>, which is an anything-goes doctrine. He dabbles in chemistry, mindswapping, radical geology and any number of other fields. His actual plans can be awful, but his science is quite brilliant, even if he steals a lot of his inventions. The series does seem to imply there's a difference between real science, which is specialised and realistic and mad science which can do anything but is likely to blow up in your face.
</li><li> His arch-rival Professor Dementor seems to be more of a straight physicist, but that may be due more to his relative lack of screen time. Ironically, unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polymath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polymath">polymath</a> Drakken, he is very competent and fairly successful, to the point that Drakken often steals from him (or at least tries to).
</li></ul></li><li> Professor Membrane and Zim from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>. Zim is more of an inversion, as he's barely competent to highly incompetent in almost everything he does, it's just that he's (badly) using super-advanced technology. His own computer system has pointed out his lack of adroitness on a few occasions. He is a highly capable engineer, but even here he tends to shoot himself in the foot. Sometimes literally.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainNTheGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainNTheGameMaster">Captain N: The Game Master</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Dr. Light</a>, normally an expert of robotics, performing medical duties on a very human patient. Makes you wonder why they didn't use the opportunity to promote the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMario">Dr. Mario</a></em> game.
<ul><li> Probably because it was one of the few episodes with no leanings toward comedy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad">Exo Squad</a></em>: Prof. Algernon is skilled in theoretical physics (discovering the Gravitational Focus Effect which "cannot be explained by normal physics"), numerous forms of engineering (building the GRAF Shield, upgrading Able Squad's E-Frames), and neuroscience (curing Dark Matter Syndrome). Also VR painting. However, when consulted on the subject of genetics, he is quick to point out that it isn't his field and can provide no assistance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Professor Sumdac spends most of the second season as Megatron's prisoner, forced to help him construct a space-bridge from stolen Autobot schematics. He specifically mentions that this isn't his area of expertise, though he gets the hang of it eventually (having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megatron</a> as his 'boss' probably encouraged him).
<div class="indent">"I don't know anything about space bridges, I don't claim to know anything about them, this is not even my area of expertise: I do servo mechanics, not <em>teleportation</em>."
</div></li><li> Judging by his inventions, Professor Utonium of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> is, at the minimum, an electrical engineer, a chemist, a biologist, and a theoretical physicist. He has a Nobel Prize in "Science."
</li><li> Dexter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> has probably covered every scientific field there is thanks to his show essentially being a Sci-Fi cartoon. He appears to prefer robotics above all else though.
</li><li> Similar to the Dexter example, Jimmy Neutron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutron">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron</a></em> has worked in innumerous areas of science, and it's harder to identify which ones he <em>hasn't</em>.
</li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> have constructed everything from robots to spaceships to time machines, despite only being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">fourteen at most</a>. The same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Dr. Doofenshmirtz, who can create anything you can slap the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">-inator</a>" suffix on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>'s Stewie has mastered time travel, weather manipulation, robotics, cloning...and still isn't potty-trained. Oh yeah, he's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">Professor Frink</a> has been everything from an astronomer to a physicist to an entomologist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>: Egon Spengler is supposed to be a psychologist and parapsychologist. He is almost always a physicist (and paraphysicist) and mathematician as well. On top of that, depending on what the plot wants him to know, he's also a qualified engineer, microbiologist, evolutionary biologist, biochemist, chemist, entomologist, etc. And he still has time to be a mycologist in his spare time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodzillaTheSeries">Godzilla: The Series</a></em>: Drs. Nick Tatopolous was a radiobiologist (radiations' effects on living things) and Elsie Chapman is a paleontologist. Dr. Mendel Craven is established as a roboticist, but he's quite capable in computer programming, biochemistry, and engineering. All three share knowledge in various branches of chemistry, biology, and especially zoology. Elsie sort of lampshades it by mentioning Mendel having two PhDs in the first episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>: Dilbert has, on the show, designed exercise machines (one incorporating an experimental graviton generator), rockets, satellites, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>, a rocket equipped with AI, and massive networked computer systems. His company has also produced everything from throat lozenges to rocket ships.
</li><li> Doctor Krieger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>. He's primarily a mechanical engineer, although he's also been shown to dabble in artificial intelligence, medicine, biochemistry and genetics. However, it's implied that Krieger actually has no formal scientific education, for instance he believes in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism">humorism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and while he's clearly a genius it's often left up in the air how much he truly understands what he's doing half the time. He appears to be less this trope and more of a highly intuitive lunatic that Mallory funds and tolerates because he occasionally produces something useful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em> has this trope all over the place. Donatello is only <em>15</em>, and yet clearly is quite knowledgeable in engineering, robotics, and computer programming - even when its <em>in an alien language</em>. He's also shown working in chemistry and biology. This might however be handwaved as a consequence of his mutant nature, as various human scientists tend to be more limited. Baxter Stockman is clearly more a robotics man than anything else, and Doctor Falco doesn't dabble in too much beyond biology (even if taken to odd extremes). Its also invoked by Leo regarding why the Kraang took April's father, claiming that its because "He's a scientist", only to be defied by April when she points out that her father's field of study (psychology) is completely <em>irrelevant</em> to what the Kraang are doing.
</li><li> Several of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax">Mighty Max</a></em>'s various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> enemies can qualify. For example, Professor Zygote is supposedly an evolutionary biologist, but he also knows an awful lot about gene splicing, plus enough about engineering to have built himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevolutionDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevolutionDevice">Devolution Device</a>. Dr. Bob Scorpio also qualifies; his primary field of study seems to be some odd combination of entomology and nuclear physics, granting him both the ability to create mutant scorpions and the knowledge to make a nuclear bomb big enough to destroy all of Nevada.
</li><li> Elise from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> is a government agent who's been involved in several top secret experiments.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>: Mr. Peabody may well be one of the greatest geniuses in fiction. Never mind that he's a master historian who built a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a>, various episodes show his expertise in chemistry, engineering, geography, mathematics, and biology, along with various other useful skills. He may even be skilled in alchemy, given how he was able to whip up something that made Leif Erikson's beard grow instantly. If there's a science where his knowledge falls short of an expert, it has yet to be revealed.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrPeabodyAndSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrPeabodyAndSherman">movie</a> takes this trope even further, Mr. Peabody is now also an excellent athlete, mixologist, can play every musical instrument in the world and is a certified chiropractor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TennesseeTuxedoAndHisTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TennesseeTuxedoAndHisTales">Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales</a></em>: Mr. Whoopie seems to know everything, literally. While usually just acting as an advisor, he has, in various episodes, repaired electronics, used medical equipment, and performed classroom-style experiments in chemistry and biology.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> partially solved this by lumping many of the scientific fields shown throughout the series (organic and inorganic chemistry, genetics, biology and biochem, radiobiology, and so on, mixed with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a>) into the pseudo-field of "neogenics", but then you've got people who do that <em>all that and more</em>.
<ul><li> A noticeable example is Alistair Smythe, introduced as a robotics expert, used for building Spider-Slayers. He's later upgraded into a cyborg and somewhere along the way enters this trope, performing neogenic experiments for the bad guys.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibleHulk1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibleHulk1996">The Incredible Hulk (1996)</a></em>, where Bruce needs to give his cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">Jennifer</a> a blood transfusion to save her life after she's injured in an explosion. While beginning the procedure, Bruce remarks that he took two years of pre-med in college, implying that he'd briefly considered becoming a medical doctor before switching his focus to nuclear physics.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernFriedGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernFriedGenius">Southern-Fried Genius</a> equivalent of this Trope, able to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology">Bamboo Technology</a> to invent almost anything, spanning several scientific disciplines and surpassing all of them. Among his inventions on the show was the Deathmatch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a>, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mechas</a>, an enlarging ray, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Super Freaks</a>, created via gene splicing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScienceCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScienceCourt">Science Court</a></em> the first expert witness called to testify was usually a recurring character like Julie Bean whose scientific expertise changed every episode depending upon the subject matter. Professor Parsons however plays this trope completely straight as he claims to be an expert in every scientific field known to man.
</li><li> Presumably, the Author of the Journals from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a>. His journals cover a wide variety of subjects, including (but not limited to) the anatomy and physiology of several animals, plants, and fungi, local history, folklore, and customs, creation and operation of several advanced devices, and even studies regarding the occult. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Confirmed when he's finally introduced in the show proper. Stanford Pines is nothing less than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a>, having dedicated himself to study anything as long as it is weird and unusual. He also designed and built a freaking <em>interdimensional portal</em>. According to himself, he has <em>twelve</em> PhD's, all of them presumably in different disciplines.

<ul><li> Can, rarely, be an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>—if you go far enough back in history. This is the origin of the phrase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a>; during the Renaissance, most fields of science were sufficiently new and undeveloped that someone with above-average intelligence could be an expert in more than one or two. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>'s time, science had sufficiently diversified that this was no longer possible except in emerging fields; Goethe (an extreme case of genius) is thus sometimes called "the last man to know everything". Much the same is said of Henri Poincaré (died 1912) in mathematics.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a> <em>did</em> also have to know what at the time was treated like science and was later found not to actually work - all manner of mysticism, in short, including alchemy, astrology, etc. He would generally treat magic as another science - it made as much sense as anything else at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>: Engineer, anatomist, architect, botanist, geologist, cartographer, mathematician, artist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> knew everything there was to know in his time. He proved the Earth was round, catalogued every known animal (along the way, he was the first to differentiate whales from fish), advanced all natural sciences, organized legal knowledge, and made art commentaries that are still quoted in colleges (particularly his problems with "Deus Machina" endings), and the list goes on... He wrote the book on every discipline of his time and made new advancements in almost every one of them.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher">Athanasius Kircher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is another historical example, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> tendencies as well. Not only did he study geology, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">ancient Egyptian</a> heiroglyphs ("decoding" occult meanings that probably weren't there), and microbiology (in his time a new science), he designed a "cat piano" played by making the cats squeal in pain.
</li><li> While geared towards engineering rather than research, fields of bioengineering deal with applications of technology with respect to biological systems. This means that bioengineers have to be trained in various sciences pertaining to engineering (usually mechanical or electrical engineering, so various fields of physics) and biochemistry. This isn't nearly every discipline, but it is still a much broader range than most scientists and engineers tend to deal with.
<ul><li> The first two years of an undergrad degree in bioengineering can feel like they are spent trying to become one of these. Often it isn't until the third year that students actually start bringing all those different disciplines together. Some people say doing actual engineering is what graduate school is for.
</li><li> Biomedical engineering is especially diverse, requiring knowledge of mechanical, electrical, and bioengineering, chemistry, biology, physics, computer programming, some post-calculus mathematics, statistics, and materials science. They even take some limited coursework in liability law. It is probably the closest thing to an omnidisciplinary scientist there is, and it is so by necessity.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the case of the Wright brothers. You'd think that people who successfully developed powered flight would be something special and know about everything from engineering to physics to what have you. Wrong. No one on the Wright team had more than a high school education and the brothers themselves operated a bicycle shop. But the high school the Wrights attended was equivalent to a modern four-year college and Wilbur had intended to go to Princeton. Yet manufacturing bicycles <em>is</em> engineering. They also closely observed birds, developed wind tunnels, and made prototypes, so they developed flight following the scientific method.
</li><li> Their rival, Samuel Pierpoint Langley, <em>did</em> play this trope straight. He was astronomer, physicist, inventor of the bolometer and aviation pioneer. He did not invent the aircraft, but he invented the aircraft catapult. All catapults used today on aircraft carriers are based on his design.
</li><li> Jared Diamond's book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GunsGermsAndSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GunsGermsAndSteel">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a></em> is largely based on the fact that being a physiologist, geographer and a biologist (among other things) gave him a new viewpoint to anthropology and history. It should not be left unsaid that the majority of geographers, anthropologists, historians, and so forth think that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.livinganthropologically.com/archaeology/guns-germs-and-steel-jared-diamond/">"his work from Guns Germs and Steel to Collapse is a distorting disservice to the real historical record"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The opinions of most scholars seem to range from <a class="urllink" href="https://historycooperative.org/journal/world-according-jared-diamond/">"Diamond has pushed the argument too far"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to a five-page editorial titled, quite simply, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.unm.edu/~dcorreia/David_Correia/Research_files/Correia_F**K_CNS.pdf">"F**k Jared Diamond."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The consensus appears to be that, at <em>best</em>, Jared Diamond's work might be helpful for popularizing non-racist explanations of topics that have typically been a hotbed for racist discussion (i.e. explaining the industrialization and global dominance of Europe in terms that don't boil down to "white people are inherently superior"), but he's still not <em>factually correct</em> about a lot of the things he's saying.
</li><li> The specialization of scientists nowadays is in fact somewhat of a problem which many universities now try to fix by recommending interdisciplinary studies.
</li><li> Al-Jazari (copied from the other wiki) was a "Muslim polymath: a scholar, inventor, mechanical engineer, craftsman, artist, mathematician and astronomer". Though he is most famous for his engineering feats. He invented robots. He was also one of the first pioneers of, you guessed it, algebra.
</li><li> Michael Faraday is essentially a founding figure in chemistry, physics, and any discipline involving electricity. He discovered benzene (paving the way for practically all organic chemistry since), invented an early type of Bunsen burner, formulated and demonstrated the principle of electric induction (effectively inventing the electric generator), and invented the electric motor. His work also laid the ground for field theory in physics.
</li><li> Debating a topic for long enough requires arguing from any POV or angles (scientific, metaphysical, cultural, economic, political..); this naturally leads to multidisciplinary understanding and comprehension, but not mastery.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>: botanist, architect, philosopher, inventor, engineer, statesman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>: he was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, scientist, musician, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. He invented everything from Bifocals and a heater to lighting rods. On top of that, he <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Book_&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%9CExperiments_and_Observations_on_Electricity&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%9D_by_Benjamin_Franklin,_1751">wrote the book on electricity.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Jean-Paul Marat was a political theorist, a politician and a journalist, but also a physician, who dabbled in optical sciences (predicting the laser in one of his works) and curing illnesses like gonorrhea.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> was the guy <em>other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> authors</em> would go to for information on stuff. When asked what it felt like to know everything, he responded that it felt "like being a museum."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshayahu_Leibowitz">Yeshayuha Leibowitz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Israeli intellectual and outspoken Orthodox Jew, also had doctorates in philosophy, medicine, chemistry and biochemistry.
</li><li> Several well-known crackpots throughout history considered themselves to be masters of several fields of science at once — and, sometimes, their followers agreed with them. Wilhelm Reich, who created the notion of Orgone Energy, was trained in medicine and psychiatry; but his proponents also claim he was an expert chemist, biologist, nuclear physicist, and astronomer, because his theories brushed up against those subjects.
</li><li> Astronauts. Typically they have <em>at least</em> one doctorate in one of the hard sciences — multiple doctorates are common — plus they are cross-trained in other disciplines, and they learn how to operate spaceships, work in zero gravity, and fix stuff that goes wrong.
</li><li> Modern scientists
<ul><li> Many modern scientists are proficient computer programmers. They have a need for custom software and rarely have the funds to hire a pro. In many disciplines they also become very adept electronics technicians or mechanics as a result of building experimental equipment from scratch. Field biologists who collect live specimens can be alarmingly good shots with a rifle. Many chemists are (or at least, have been in the past) quite proficient glass blowers, due to the need to make custom equipment. Furthermore, while a given scientist may not have formal education in another field, most scientists are trained to think the same way, and typically as a consequence understand more about other fields than the average non-scientist. Physicists understanding quantum chemistry, chemists understanding molecular biology, etc.
</li><li> Any scientist who does field work is often this. Geologist working in the Arctic? Skilled at cold weather survival, fixing engines, probably better at getting electronics to work in the cold than the engineer who designed them, and a decent shot with a rifle on top of it (polar bears). Marine biologist in the tropics? Skilled boat handler, mechanic, SCUBA diver, and likely has strong opinions about, and an impressive collection of, knives. Working in an isolated area to do something that maybe a dozen people in the world actually understand tends to do this.

He's an expert in both the wreck of the Titanic, and the theoretical design of antimatter starships. (However, it appears his claims of having a Ph.D. from Victoria University may have been a fabrication.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> was an author whose scientific knowledge consisted of one nuclear physics class at which he failed. However, according to the Church of Scientology, he was a nuclear physicist, botanist, anthropologist, evolutionary biologist, archaeologist, psychologist, pilot, musician, photographer, cinematographer, philosopher and expert in at least one field that he himself invented.
</li><li> Among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">many other achievements</a>, retired NASA astronaut <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_Musgrave#Education">Story Musgrave<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> holds five STEM degrees (two bachelor's, two master's, and a doctorate), specifically in mathematics,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18xkm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18xkm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18xkm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">B.S., Syracuse University.</span> computer programming,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2s0rv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2s0rv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2s0rv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">MBA, University of California, Los Angeles.

He has written or been listed as a co-author of twenty five scientific papers in the areas of aerospace medicine and physiology, temperature regulation, exercise physiology, and clinical surgery, and one of his main hobbies is building microcomputers.
</li><li> While a modern MD or DO does not have the depth of a PhD in their field, they must have a strong background in physics, chemistry (organic and inorganic), biology, anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, pathophysiology, psychology, a good clinical eye, strong interpersonal skills, microbiology, parasitology, and a decent understanding of biostatistics and medical jurisprudence. Most docs also train to read various imaging techniques and lab equipment, and some perform their own tests. This is before the physical skills for any procedures their specialty requires. Add a very strict code of ethics and the need to know their communities and how to address health needs at a local level as well; being multilingual is very valuable to most docs. Additionally, fulfilling their oath requires being a teacher to medical students and residents and an advocate to their community, requiring another skill set for education. Finally, doctors in private practice have to be astute business managers. Then the MD/PhDs and MD/JDs come around, adding a medical degree to another doctorate.
