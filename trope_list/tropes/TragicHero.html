This trope is rare on television, perhaps because watching someone fail once teaches a lesson, while watching them fail every Tuesday gets boring—though that didn't stop shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> or the so-inappropriately-titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodTimes">Good Times</a></em>, no matter how hard they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Yank the Dog's Chain</a>.

As an antagonist, their goals are opposed to the protagonist's, but the audience still feels sympathetic towards them.
</p><p>By the time a Tragic Hero antagonist is defeated, the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">feels sympathetic</a> to the Tragic Hero, and a little bad about having to capture them. It is acceptable and common to defeat a Tragic Hero antagonist by stopping them from achieving their goal, but otherwise letting them go free. Tragic Hero antagonists are rarely killed, except when death is seen by the Tragic Hero as an honorable end which is preferable to capture. Tragic Hero protagonists usually die, but that depends somewhat on the tastes of each era (they always die in Shakespeare, but ancient protagonists would often suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">A Fate Worse Than Death</a> and/or be left to wallow in their pain instead).

Aristotle only says that seeing a prosperous person fall is a good source of pathos, and that it's more pathetic to see a not-entirely-bad person suffer due to a mistake than to see wholly good people suffer for reasons beyond their control. That said, Aristotle's favorite tragedy, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing">Oedipus the King</a></em>, is a good example of this trope, so the trope itself is definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.

This is a rare case where both protagonist and antagonist are tragic heroes.

The guilt over killing his best friend makes Harry slowly lose his sanity. On the other hand, Brandon Heat, who is loyal to the fault, cannot bring himself to stop Harry even when he knows Harry is obviously going down the wrong path and ends up getting killed. In a way, Brandon is also responsible for the deaths of his other loved ones as Brandon's death causes Harry to hunt down those whom Brandon holds dear (as Harry reasons that those people "took Brandon from him"). At the end of the series, after destroying each other completely, both Brandon and Harry realize that the only time they were truly "free" was when they lived in a slum with three other friends (whose deaths led Brandon and Harry to join the Millenion in the first place) and decide to take the only way out: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">killing each other</a></span>.

As a coping mechanism, she tried to become a hero who would uphold ideals. She believed in justice, but her growing resentment made her shift from protecting the innocent to punishing the wicked. When Sayaka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">realizes how she had come to contradict her earlier aspirations</a>, all the hatred turns inward.

<ul><li> It's worth a note that the series itself is a nod to Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, and that Homura's character parallels the tragic hero of that story. In it, Faust's ambition leads him to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, and Homura's deal with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyubey</span> is a reference to this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She earns a little bit more sympathy, though, since she's doing it to save Madoka.

<ul><li> Another reason that Homura will never succeed is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she would do anything- even die- to protect Madoka, and Madoka would do the same for Homura.

However, the enemy she faces is vastly older, more powerful and more sophisticated than this 14-year-old girl and manipulates her handily, turning her into the Tragic Hero through the final third of the series. (Even so, Utena manages to pull off a win against him — confusing and puzzling, but a win nonetheless.)

He originally rejects his Ghoul half, clinging to his humanity and idealism to the extent that he is rendered helpless. Eventually, he concludes that his kindness is actually weakness and abandons his humanity in order to become strong enough to protect everyone. His quest for power, however, causes him to isolate the very people he seeks to protect and slowly destroys his sanity.

He starts out the film as an honorable hero of Gotham nicknamed Gotham's 'White Knight'. He is uncompromising and risks his life for the criminals of Gotham to be put away. However, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> is his illogical love for Rachel, which is shown when he would rather he die than Rachel, despite all the innocent people who are relying on him and all the criminals who would get put back onto the streets. This is what ultimately corrupts him, in contrast to Bruce Wayne who wasn't corrupted despite loving her too. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her death at the hands of The Joker</span> he turns into a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cop killing murderer, using a coin flip to determine who lives or dies</span> regardless of morality or other factors which would have affected his decisions before.

He has a sense of justice that won't allow him to let the strong to victimize the weak, and his own heroism ultimately brings about his undoing and destruction. Tom could have let Liberty Valance kill Ranse Stoddard, which in turn would have let Tom keep his girl. Instead, he commits murder to save Ranse, with the certain knowledge that he would also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl">lose his girl</a>. By his own hand, he destroys his own hopes and dreams. That which gave his life meaning is gone. He lets Stoddard take all the credit, which leads to a successful political career, while Tom wanes into a nobody, a dissipated life, a forgotten man.
</li><li> Anakin Skywalker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> is a Tragic Hero in the prequels. He is a hero of the Republic, gets the girl, helps win the war, and saves his Master a number of times. His Fatal Flaw is the fear of losing those he cares about, which feeds a hunger for power to prevent it from ever happening and eventually turned him into the frightening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight">Black Knight</a> Darth Vader.
<ul><li> His main Fatal Flaw is the desire for <em>control</em>- a concept that had evaded him his entire life. As a slave he had no control over his life and neither does he as a Jedi. His fear of death and the death of his loved ones is a representation of his need to control EVERYTHING, even what should be uncontrollable (i.e death). This flaw is tucked away for much of the prequel trilogy with only odd mentions (he mentions a couple of times to Padme how he wants to control the galaxy) but fully reveals itself in the OT where Vader is the epitome of tyranny and order. With all his loved ones dead or now his enemy, all that the man has left is his intense need for control.

Marcos is his fear of failure: he can't stand the other's pity, he can't bear to fail with regards to his mother, he can't bear the thought of how his dad would disintegrate if Marco was killed, etc. and that drives his ruthlessness and cynicism. Rachels is rage, and a fear of helplessness. The fear that they might lose the war. Cassies is a moral panic, the realization that to save the world they might become that which they fight, a fear of doing evil. Tobias, who has never fitted in anywhere, it a fear of failing the rest of the team, the one family he has ever really known, and the creeping realization that even before the war is over, there is no place for him in the world after it. Ax is his pride in his race, and the shattering of those illusions, the fear of the reality that the Andalites are in fact almost as bad as the Yeerks in many ways.

At the start of the book he is one of the most prosperous and respected men in his village: He's a champion wrestler, has three wives and eight children, lots of wealth in yams, and a solid place in the community that he earned by working very hard. His father was a lazy weakling who preferred to loaf around and play music instead of taking care of his family and farm; In order to get rid of his father's shame, Okonkwo tried to be the exact opposite in every way. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> is that he overcompensates for his underlying insecurity by being emotionally distant and overly concerned about everybody thinking he's manly, which leads him to make impulsive mistakes. For instance, he is given a boy called Ikemefuna to take care of who was a political hostage from another village, and for three years he raises him like his own son. When he's informed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the village had decided to kill the boy</span>, that person warns him to take no part in it himself, but he does it himself because he's afraid to be thought of as weak.

It is during this hard time, that Robert is introduced to his only friend Arvid. But otherwise, his life at this point is just like a nightmare. He decides to run away from his cruel master, and he plans to follow his brother Karl Oskar over to America. But not even leaving Sweden means that things become better for Robert. His romance with Elin is cut short before it really even starts, and he never seems to be able to get near another girl. He sets out to find gold, but he only has to experience things like watching Arvid die a painful death and losing the gold he <em>did</em> find.

The Doctor's long-standing, personal duty to save everyone and anyone he can has long been problematic due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>. But by the end of this season, it is warped by centuries of loss, grief, and self-pity into a selfish need to save them <strong>no matter what</strong> — if it means going to extreme measures, defying the fates and the wishes of those he's saving, he'll do it, damn the consequences. A snowballing series of events begins in "The Girl Who Died" as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he saves a young viking girl, Ashildr, by turning her into a functional immortal</span>. Centuries later in "Face the Raven", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she collaborates with the Time Lords to capture him  a trap that inadvertently leads to his beloved companion Clara's death</span>. In "Heaven Sent" immediately afterward, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is trapped in a torture chamber, his grief fresh; consumed by rage and anguish, he fights his way out of it over billions of years</span>.

In the end, the first step in restoring things to rights is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only losing Clara again, but losing <em>his memories of her</em></span>, and he realizes this is only right and proper punishment for his selfishness. He lives to be the Doctor another day — a sadder, wiser man, free to be his best self again.

</li><li> Ned is a straight example in that his values, character, and morals all lead him to his death — if he had done otherwise, he would not be the same person. He absolutely will not commit or condone the heinous action of killing a child, regardless of the political benefit. In the end, Ned is killed by the cruel whims of the same child that he had intended to spare from Robert's wrath. Another example in regards to Ned is — that out of love for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his sister Lyanna and his nephew Jon</span> — he lies to everyone that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jon is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimate son</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">protect Jon from the Baratheon regime</a>. This action causes strain in Ned's marriage to Catelyn, leading to Jon being raised under somewhat difficult circumstances, since — though Ned raises Jon in an otherwise loving family — Catelyn resents Jon for being her husband's son by another woman</span> and there is nearly nothing Ned can do about this situation, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as he needs this cover story to protect his nephew and keep him safe.</span>
</li><li> Despite Catelyn's efforts to see her children safe, she spends her final days knowing Sansa is a captive of the enemy, Arya is missing, and believing Bran and Rickon are apparently dead. When her firstborn son is killed right in front of her, she gives up all hope.
</li><li> Robb's initial success at rallying the forces of the North is cut short because, like his father, he's unable to follow through on the political compromises needed to strengthen his victory. This results in a series of errors which make him vulnerable to betrayal, culminating in breaking his marriage pact to the Freys and marrying for love.
</li><li> Tyrion's open animosity towards Joffrey really comes back to bite him when he is tried for Joffrey's murder. When Jaime offered him a chance to falsely confess his guilt in order for Tywin to spare him and send him to The Wall, Tyrion refused and demanded a Trial of Combat out of pride and anger, which nearly gets him killed and forces him into exile.

In order to get the cure so that Damon could live, Stefan sacrificed himself to Klaus, turned off his humanity and became a Ripper in order to get the cure for Damon, protect Elena from Klaus and protect the entire town of Mystic Falls.
<ul><li> One of Stefan's fatal flaws is his inability to understand or embrace the concept of moderation; when he's in love, it's completely obsessive desperate love. When he's killing, he's doing it basically non-stop and incredibly violently. When he likes his brother, he'll do anything for him; when he doesn't, he shuts him out completely. His intentions are almost always good; his actions are about fifty fifty.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> had too many tragic heroes to count. There is the story of Oedipus who was cursed to marry his mother and kill his father, Prometheus, Orestes.
<ul><li> Oedipus was mostly guilty of trying to fight his fate (and being a bit too harsh on murder and incest, since the punishments he gave himself were the punishments he said he would give to anyone who killed the king), running away from his adoptive home after an oracle said he would kill his father and marry his mother, and then later when another oracle said he should stop pursuing the former king's killer and they got in a fight, the oracle revealed that Oedipus was the killer, and that he married his mother.
</li><li> Prometheus accomplished his mission, stealing fire for mortal man. And tricked the Gods as to which parts of animals the humans were to sacrifice. It's just... you know... he pissed off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Jerkass Gods</a> in the process of helping humanity. So Zeus chained him to a rock and had an eagle eat his innards. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Since he's immortal. Hercules breaks him free. Eventually, after centuries. If anything, it counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of, Hercules could go on this list as well. Those famous 12 Labors? Penance, for being driven into a berserk rage (by HERA) and murdering his own family. Then he gets another wife, who gets kidnapped by a centaur named Nessus. Herc shoots him with a poison arrow (dipped in the Hydra's blood). Dying, Nessus tells her to rub his blood on Herc's clothes if she ever thinks Herc is being unfaithful, and it will tell the truth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooStupidToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooStupidToLive">Blood that is now laced with the Hydra's poison</a>.

Miller, however, argued for years that Willy Loman was a tragic hero who fell not from the height of social position but from the height of his aspirations and self-delusions. Eventually, Miller admitted that Loman's character was <em>pathetic</em>, not <em>tragic</em> because he stubbornly failed to learn anything <em>from</em> his fall and thought maybe he would have achieved his goal if he had focused more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Willy Loman's son, Biff</a>.

When he finally acquires his prize, the Cursed Sword Soul Edge, the Evil Sword is able to utterly consume his fragile psyche, completely transforming him into an extension of the sword itself; the demon-knight Nightmare.

In his first Street Fighter tournament, he made it all the way to the end, only to lose to Sagat. Unable to cope with losing, he gave into the Satsui no Hadou and gave a Metsu Shoryuken to Sagat, branding him with his signature chest scar and causing him to swear revenge on Ryu. Ryu is always at a constant inner struggle with himself: Should he continue to resist the Satsui no Hadou, or give in as Akuma suggests?

Afterwards, he is let out of jail and tries to get revenge by fighting criminals outside. He gets arrested again, and becomes addicted to fighting within prison. He then eventually breaks out, and joins the Street Fighting cast in their tournament(s). After all these events, he usually claims that he will never be the hero again, and often states that all he has left is fighting (which he often exclaims is pointless). However, by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, Cody has managed to at least keep his internal demons in check enough to convince the people of Metro City he's a changed man, and eventually win the Mayor elections. But while he does take his new job seriously, his quotes on the game clearly show this Nihilistic Tragic way of thinking is still buried inside him. Time will tell if he actually manages to fully conquer it.

He is the son of Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima, and lived happily with his mother Jun until he was 15 and an evil entity named Ogre attacked his forest home in Japan and after the attack, his mother was nowhere to be found and declared missing. Jin then sought out his grandfather Heihachi Mishima to train him to take down Ogre once and for all, Jin unaware of his grandfather's ulterior motives. At the age of 19, he entered the Third King of Iron Fist Tournament where he managed to finish off Ogre and avenge his mother, but soon afterward, was gunned down by the Tekken Force, with Heihachi making the killing shot on his own grandson. Soon afterwards, Jin's Devil Gene awakens and lays waste to the Tekken Force and slams Heihachi through a wall and flies off into the night. It is from this point onward that Jin begins to loathe the name of Mishima and everything associated with them, even to the point of unlearning their fighting style and taking on traditional Karate. Jin strives to put an end to his accursed bloodline once and for all, if the Devil Gene within him doesn't completely dominate him first.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> was his loathing of weakness in both himself and his Clan.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>, ironically enough, was his idealism. Eventually, it killed him.
<ul><li> To expand upon this, Archer is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an alternate Shirou who also fought in the Fifth Holy Grail War</span>. As an adult he continued to pursue his ideal and saved many people. However, because he was so focused on his ideal he rarely spoke to people and never asked for rewards so he became estranged from them and was finally falsely blamed and executed for starting a war he had attempt to stop. Before he died he had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven">made a contract with Alaya to save a hundred lives</a> and became a Counter-Guardian on dying. He had hoped to continue saving lives with this role but was instead tasked with killing humans who threatened the continued existence of humanity</span>. Feeling that his own ideal had betrayed him, Archer became bitter with his only hope being to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cause a paradox that would erase his existence</span>. Notably the same sentence used to describe Kiritsugu is also used to describe Archer.

She sets out to do things to make people happy so that they will like her, but her competitive personality and occasional difficulty avoiding coming off as abrasive drives away the rest of the student council, including her cousin Lilly. The only person who stays on is her close friend and interpreter, Misha, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who has unrequited love for Shizune</span>, and Shizune, unfortunately, ends up taking Misha's presence for granted. Much of Act 4 of her route involves her coming to terms with her flaws and taking steps to address them, such as making amends with Misha, who has been becoming distant from her.

Vaarsuvius's exact words were actually "I still have to fix everything", but the subsequent attempts to do so have allowed V to realize the mistake made without dying like so many tragic heroes. Sadly, this bit of wisdom is unlikely to be much help with fixing V's family life.

The twist however, is that his friends and family are killed in an explosion, leading his arch enemy Vlad to take him in. Far MORE twisted is that in a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> procedure to rip out his humanity from his ghostly half, the ghost half ends merging with Vlad's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">ghost half</a>, murdering Fenton, and beginning a ten year rampage around the entire world and succeeding.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lapis's traumatic past hangs heavy over her character arc and feeds her self-sabotaging nature. As much as she's been hurt by others; her cynicism, anger, and a combination of selfishness and self-hatred sabotage any of her attempts at getting better. When she traps herself with Jasper inside of Malachite it's clear that as much as she wanted to save Steven, there were many other easier ways and she went with this one purely so she could have someone to drag down with her. Upon realizing the Diamonds will be returning to Earth, Lapis uproots her home and abandons Peridot and Steven, some of the few people to connect with her, stranding herself in a lonely prison of her own making.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I was so sure the Diamonds would destroy my new home, that I did it myself. It's like I'm back inside The Mirror, except I put myself here."
</div><ul><li> A big part of Rose Quartz's arc is breaking down the pedastal she'd been placed on by other characters to show. In many ways Rose was the kind, compassionate leader everyone remembers as but in other ways she was lonely, guilt-ridden, and consistently sad. It was revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that she was Pink Diamond, having broke away from the other Diamonds to free Earth and liberate the Gems on it</span>. In doing so she ended up compiling problem after problem upon the Crystal Gems as they ultimately could neither win the war, nor save any of the Gems corrupted by it. Much of the rhetoric she spoke about the evils of the Diamonds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was her guilt talking and making her want everyone to hate Pink, aka herself, just as much as she did</span>. To quote <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/steven-universe-future-finale-rebecca-sugar.html">Rebecca Sugar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Rose is her own worst enemy  <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">literally, she fought herself</span>. The way she felt about herself caused so much pain for everybody around her, especially the people who loved her and the people she wanted to love. One thing I find really interesting is that the way she idolized everyone around her was very sincere. She thought everyone around her was so much better than she was. So people would be drawn to her, Gems would be drawn to her, and I dont know if they would necessarily realize that she was worshipping them, which was compounding her own sadness at the feeling that she couldnt connect with them. It was a tragedy."
</div></li><li> Rusty Venture from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">Venture Brothers</a></em>. In a show that the creators have described as being about failure, Rusty may be a sometimes brilliant scientist, but his flaws- the biggest of which is his inferiority complex regarding his father- often hold him back while his brother manages to attain great successes.
