<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, Keiichi gets turned down by Sayoko, the most popular girl at the college they attend. Once Belldandy shows up in his life, Sayoko starts to get jealous of him and tries to break them up in various ways, with no such luck. In Season 2 she starts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">realize her own feelings</a> for him.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube">Hell Teacher Nube</a></em> first falls in love with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher">Hot Teacher</a> Ritsuko, who switches between appreciating him for being a good person and despise how his side-job is dealing with the ghosts she hates so much. When she finally starts to return his feelings, he had already moved on to Yukime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> has a very mild, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> example. Normally Karen and Erika are completely dismissive or oblivious in regards to Toyosaki and Kazamatsuri's advances, but when the guys decide to spend time with a different duo of girls during the class trip Karen is immediately pissed off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi">Kimi no Iru Machi</a></em>: Haruto has been infatuated with Nanami all through middle school, and continues despite misconceptions that he's dating Yuzuki, a family friend who moved into his family's home to go to the same high school. He confesses, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nanami rejects him, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">she sees that he's become hung up on Yuzuki</a>. He eventually moves on to Yuzuki, and Nanami soon starts acting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">rather jealous</a>...</span>
<ul><li> And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuzuki moves away, breaks up with him because she can't handle a long-distance relationship, and gets a new boyfriend. Haruto follows her and spends a good while trying to rekindle their relationship, until Yuzuki's new boyfriend dies of complications from a degenerative illness... At which point Yuzuki, who turns out to have still carried a torch for Haruto after all, finds out that Haruto has started to develop feelings for Akira instead.</span>

George at first is turned off by Metallis' attempts at confessing his love, then the latter falls in love with a girl, Suzuka, and begins aggressively pursuing her. George immediately starts to get jealous and tries to win Metallis' affections, or at least his attention, but ultimately fails at the end.
</li><li> This trope is played almost completely straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy">Marmalade Boy</a></em>, <em>especially</em> in the backstory: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ginta had a crush on Miki, who slipped a love letter in his school book. Ginta just <em>happened</em> to find it when he's with some male friends who begin to tease him about it. Under pressure, he says that he doesn't love Miki that way... only to see that Miki and Meiko <em>are right there</em>. Miki, understandably, is <em>very</em> hurt - even after Ginta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">shaves his head</a> to show how sorry he is. And some time later, it turns out Ginta <em>still</em> loves Miki even when her feelings are more friendly than romantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings">and is beginning to fall for her stepbrother Yuu</a>...</span>
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">downplayed</a> example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, at the start of the series, Midoriya quickly gains a crush on Uraraka, though she remains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">unaware</a>, however this is dropped as the series progresses, and Uraraka gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">less attention in the story</a>. When romantic elements are brought back into play a few arcs later, Uraraka has now developed a massive crush on Midoriya, who no longer seems to feel the same way, or at least doesn't show it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLittleMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLittleMonster">My Little Monster</a></em>, Haru confesses his love to Shizuku but is rejected. Shizuku later begins to regret this and confesses her love to Haru however this time Haru rejects Shizuku.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em>: Before the series began, Asahi Kuromine had a crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Nagisa Aizawa</a>, only to get shot down <strong>pre-emptively</strong>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Chapter 469 has Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">long-time crush</a> Sakura tell him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseConfession">she's no longer interested in Sasuke and wants to be with him instead</a>.

It shows Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in that he's not as starved for attention as he once was and has moved past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> state that he was in back in Part I, where he constantly felt inferior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Sasuke</a>, especially since he has finally achieved his lifelong dream of being acknowledged by all of Konoha after he defeated Pain.

After things don't work out with Cho, and Ginny has already moved on, Harry develops a crush on Ginny after dealing with a bout of jealousy — a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">Green-Eyed Epiphany</a> — over Ginny's new love interest. This is somewhat subverted though, as Ginny later admits that she'd never gotten over her feelings for Harry, and was dating other boys while waiting for him to come around.
<ul><li> It's also implied that Cho develops feelings for Harry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">but it's pretty much too late by that point.</a>

</li><li> Another Russian Book called <em>Militia Sergeant</em> features this in a classic variant. Nikolaj Zacharow, a young militia officer, and Natasha, a daughter of a factory director, meet, but Natasha wants him to make a career, and not be stuck in militia, so she abandons him. Years later they meet, he is already a captain, her love for him comes back, only for him to reveal that he is already happily married and only agreed to meet her to say goodbye.

</li><li> A Polish children poem <em>Żuraw i czapla</em> {end: A Crane and a Heron) by Jan Brzechwa plays this for humor, with one of the titular birds falling for the other and being rejected only for the other bird to come around now that the first one wants nothing to do with them.

</li><li> Mal and Inara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> have an extremely complicated version of this trope. It starts with Mal, and then Inara starts to reciprocate somewhat, culminating in her giving him a kiss out of relief when she had been afraid he died, but of course, Mal was unconscious at the time and didn't figure out it happened.

Back in high school they had both snubbed her: Charlie because she wasn't pretty enough and Alan because he was just clueless. She went through extensive dieting cosmetic surgery to make herself attractive and attempted to seduce them both just so she could then reject them and rub their noses in it. Of course, after seeing how crazy she had become, they didn't count it as much of a loss.

In the season finale, Andy asks April out, but she turns him down because she believes he still has feelings for Ann. Andy breaks his arm, and Ann, who meanwhile is going through a romantic mess of her own, kisses him while taking care of him in the hospital. April learns of Andy's broken arm, causing her to realize that life is short and to agree to go out with Andy. Andy ruins his chances when he decides to tell her about his kiss with Ann.

After pursuing her for some time, she eventually reciprocates and they date for a while in season 3. When they break up, Ann spends the next several episodes trying to get over Chris while he has already moved on.

Their relationship never went past a kiss in the episode "Day of the Dot".
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, Sookie was involved in a love triangle between vampire Bill and shapeshifter Sam. She chose Bill and Sam moved on. Come Season 6, Sookie was in a rough spot and made a pass at Sam, only for him to reject her due to his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sam:</strong> Goddammit Sookie! You know how I always felt about you!
</div></li><li> There have been two so far in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, both unusual variations on the trope:
<ul><li> For most of Season 1, Skye has a rather obvious crush on Ward, her aloof and enigmatic supervising officer who's quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> towards her, and even ignores her advances to begin a casual relationship with May due to her being less emotionally complicated. Though he does eventually admit his feelings for Skye and the two briefly get together, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>very same episode</em> reveals that he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a></span>. Once Skye learns this she is, naturally, no longer keen on continuing their relationship, but Ward insists that his feelings for her were genuine, and continues to pursue her throughout Season 2, despite Skye now claiming that he makes her physically sick and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making no secret of her wish to see him die, even going so far as to (non-fatally) shoot him herself in the mid-season finale.</span>
</li><li> A weirder example occurs with Fitz-Simmons: for the first few episodes of Season 1, it seems as though Simmons has an unrequited crush on her long-time best friend, while Fitz is too preoccupied with his crush on their new teammate Skye to pay her much attention. <em>But</em> a few episodes in Fitz begins to experience a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">Love Epiphany</a> towards Simmons, who herself suddenly becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a> at around the same time, and seems about to begin a relationship with someone else. When Fitz eventually admits his feelings towards Simmons at the end of the first season, she rejects him utterly, claiming that she never thought of him that way; which leaves the question of whether Simmons's apparent attraction to Fitz was the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a>, or whether she's deliberately denying her feelings for him - even at the cost of their previously extremely close relationship - for other reasons yet to be explained.

Jake then spends the first few episodes of Season 2 completely hung up on Amy, but then dates Sophia - who, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> for Amy, actually gets him to the point of being able to declare himself over his old crush. This happy state lasts for all of about two episodes - then Jake's plans for a surprise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate">Double Date</a> go horrendously awry, with Amy revealing that she'd been trying to find a way to break up with Teddy, and Teddy countering her sudden outburst at dinner by claiming that her feelings for Jake are the reason their relationship failed. Ultimately, Jake and Sophia stay together despite this revelation, while Amy and Teddy break up, leaving Amy in more or less the same position as Jake was in the previous season (though handling it far more maturely, naturally).
