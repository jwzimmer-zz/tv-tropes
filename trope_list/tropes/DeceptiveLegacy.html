</div></div><p>Often a couple will bear a child and then split up under acrimonious circumstances. Although this is the case and the mother and father bear ill will toward each other, the remaining parent (or other parental figure) doesn't want to poison the child's mind against the other parent.

</p><p>Sometimes the child grows up, discovers the truth, and is disappointed. Sometimes the child grows up to find out the truth and doesn't care because they're simply happy to have the other parent in their lives again.

The daughter demands to know why her mom killed "the man I loved" and she responds "that man was your father!"

It gets wilder as all three discover they're witches, a fact their mother long hid from them. However, when going over some DNA tests, Macy discovers that while she and Maggie share 53% of their DNA as sisters would, Mel only has 23%. Which means <em>Mel</em> is really the half-sister who was raised with Maggie while Macy was handed off to her father while Maggie was duped into believing that she shared a absente father with Mel. Needless to say, none of the trio take this very well.

Huey, Dewey, and Louie grow up hearing all about Scrooge since he is a public figure, but despite Donald's rage at Scrooge, he never fills his young nephews' heads with negativity about Scrooge. Instead, he tells them nothing at all. It comes as a complete surprise to Huey, Dewey, and Louie when Donald takes them to Scrooge's mansion and addresses Scrooge as "Uncle Scrooge".

Soos' Abuelita is all too aware that Soos' dad is never returning, but for the sake of her grandson upholds the lie that he <em>wants</em> to come, but can't because he's too busy. Soos figures it out for himself at age 12, and it destroys his birthday for him until Dipper and Mabel fight Grobnar vs. Blendin Blandin to give Soos a time wish so he can see his father and have happy birthdays from the past until their present.

Grandmama reveals she didn't want him growing up knowing his father had abandoned him, only for Dracula to reveal the <em>actual</em> truth: he'd shapeshifted into a bat, and Grandmama, not knowing about that ability, had seen a bat in the house and driven him away. Everyone forgives everyone and Irwin and his father happily hug Dracula, only for him to realize his family is composed of nerds and scream in horror.
