</div></div><p>If a character or a team ever cheats in any sort of contest, they will end up coming last.

</p><p>Even if the cheaters don't fail by their own fault, the honest competitors will beat them anyway, though it may be a close call. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralOfTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralOfTheStory">message here</a> is that while the cheaters put all their energy into cheating, the honest players spent time getting good at the game in order to come out on top without having to resort to dirty tricks.

<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi">Akagi</a></em>. One of the marks of Akagi's brilliance is his ability to cheat really well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru">All Rounder Meguru</a></em>, the referees are <em>extremely</em> observant and ready to punish a foul. The only time the cheater isn't punished is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Mitsuya</a> suffers a thumbing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">knocks his opponent out faster than the referee can call out the foul</a> (and yes, the referee <em>had</em> noticed the foul-Mitsuya was just faster at punching out his opponent).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>, Yu uses his ability to transfer his soul to another person to look at their answers on the test. This catches up with him after Nao catches him in the act repeatedly. He's called in to the office and forced to take a test to prove that he'd legitimately earned his scores, and when he tries to use his ability on the proctor, he gets found out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChivalryOfAFailedKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChivalryOfAFailedKnight">Chivalry of a Failed Knight</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Ayase is scheduled to have a tournament sword fight with Ikki, she first tricks Ikki into using his Ittou Shura (a technique he can only use once a day due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">Heroic RRoD</a>) before the match, then litters the battlefield with dozens of magical traps (you're allowed to use traps, but you have to set them up <em>during</em> the match, not before it). Ikki actually reports her cheating before the match but persuades them to let the match continue as he wanted to prove a point. Ayase ultimately loses because her guilt dulled her reflexes and skills.
</li><li> Ikki's abusive family repeatedly tried to sabotage his matches with tactics like imprisoning and poisoning him shortly before the matches, but he would overcome this and win anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has Frost, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Universe 6 version</a> of Frieza.
<ul><li> During the Tournament of Destroyers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is caught having cheated against Goku and Piccolo with a poison needle. Goku is allowed back in the tournament and Frost is disqualified. However, Vegeta says there is no need to disqualify him, and proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">defeat Frost himself</a>, humiliating him</span>.
</li><li> In the Tournament of Power, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is angered that he was tricked and eliminated by Frieza, and humiliated when Frieza calls him an amateur/second-rate dilettante. He tries to blast Frieza from the stands as revenge, but Zeno immediately erases him from existence for attempting to break the rules</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters">Duel Masters</a></em>:
<ul><li> In their first duel, Jamira swaps his shuffled deck with a pre-arranged deck that he knows the order of so he'll always get good draws. In their second duel, he tries to hypnotize Shobu so he'll fall asleep and lose by default. Shobu beats him both times.
</li><li> Benny Haha uses cameras to spy on the cards in Shobu's hand and predict his moves. Shobu figures it out and manages to confuse him and get an advantage, then Mimi destroys the cameras. When Shobu is about to win, Benny claims that his sister is sick and that he needs to remain undefeated so that he can pay for her treatments, but Mimi tells Shobu he is lying and he finishes him off.
</li></ul></li><li> Waver Velvet is the only Master in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> who doesn't cheat at some point through the Fourth Holy Grail War. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't win, but he makes it through the war alive and is the only one of the surviving Masters who is better off at the end of the war than he was at the start.</span> Several of the others have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> come back to hurt them pretty badly, the worst easily being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kayneth, who made his fiancee his servant's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">prana</a> source so he wouldn't need to use his own, but in the process she fell in love with said servant and made her a target, ultimately getting them both killed.</span>
<ul><li> Arguably a larger, overarching theme across the different incarnations of the Holy Grail War. The original Einzbern ritual required seven mages working in unison to complete the Heaven's Feel. The squabbling between the seven started the Holy Grail Wars and cost <em>everyone</em> their chance to make their wish. To put into perspective how costly this was... the ritual could only be used once every sixty years, and it was never successfully completed in <em>two centuries</em>. Later on, the Einzbern attempt at cheating during the Third Holy Grail War instead tainted the rite so it could only complete any wish it granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">in the most awful way possible</a> and created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Great Holy Grail War</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>both</em> the masterminds working for the Grail bend or outright break the rules in an effort to stack the deck in favor of their own faction... and again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">neither gets the Grail</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>, during a cooking contest, two guys waste so much time trying to sabotage Soma and Megumi that they don't pay attention to their own dish and burn it. And in their panic, they accidentally spill a lot of salt into it, making it utterly unpalatable.
<ul><li> During the final arc, Noir chef Don Calma decides to have Takumi's brother Isami kidnapped so he can't come to his aid during a team cooking duel. What he did not anticipate was that <em>Soma</em> would come to help Takumi, let alone that the two would have such effective team work despite being rivals.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a> SAGA</em>, the Aoi team gets disqualified from CF for one year after they cheated in the Japan Grand Prix by doping (also happened in other races), kidnapping Hayato the night before the race and trying to kill him by Nagumo taking control of Al-zard computer system in the race.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Alice's attempt to cheat by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">intercepting Oarai's radio communications</span> during their match backfires when Oarai uses the tactic to lead her into a trap, and when her commander Kay, upon finding out, decides to attack with only half her forces to keep things fair.
</li><li> In the 1st Stage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em>, Takumi races against Shingo Shoji of the Myogi Night Kids in a "duct-tape deathmatch" to limit their drifting. When Takumi manages to get the hang and overtakes him, Shingo gets enraged and tries to nudge his car to make him lose control. The race ends when Shingo, trying not to embarrass himself, tries to double-crash their cars so the race ends in a tie, but Takumi evades him and Shingo crashes against the guard rail, not even finishing the race himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IsekaiQuartet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IsekaiQuartet">Isekai Quartet</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OVerlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/OVerlord">Ainz</a> tries to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stop</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">cheat on a test</a>. However, before he can even attempt to do anything, he finds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba">Aqua</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/YoujoSenki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/YoujoSenki">Tanya</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Subaru</a> are all immune, leaving him unable to do anything. Aqua attempts to cheat herself (among other mischief) and is caught standing when Ainz cancels the spell, leading to her being punished. Tanya and Subaru, who didn't exploit the Time Stop, manage to return to their seats in time and avoid punishment, while Ainz finds another way to pass the test.
</li><li> If there is a competition between the Student Council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Fujiwara will usually cheat to win only for someone to find out, and then Ishigami scolds her for cheating. Chapter 117 has Ishigami even recording her because he knows she'll cheat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe">Minami-ke</a></em>, Kana challenges Fujioka to see who can get better grades. Despite repeatedly cheating and rewriting her scores, she still always falls behind by a few points.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, where Tenma and Gillen come in second and first in their class, respectively, after cheating on a major test.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and the first portion of the Chuunin Exam. The first portion is a written test far too difficult for the level of the examinees, who are expelled with their teammates if caught cheating too many times. These details are clues to the true nature of the test: The examinees are <em>supposed</em> to cheat, but not actually get caught, as what's actually being tested is the ninjas' ability to gain information. Ibiki is somewhat amused that Naruto himself passed without even answering any questions.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie">Boruto: Naruto the Movie</a></em>. In an attempt to finally be noticed by his father, Boruto cheats in the Chunin Exam. He's briefly expelled as a ninja when he's caught.
</li></ul></li><li> Chapter 182 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou">Nichijou</a></em> features everybody except Yuuko falling asleep in class during a test. Yuuko nabs this opportunity to start copying answers off everyone else's worksheets. Yuuko is just Genre Savvy enough to realize that copying from just one worksheet could expose her due to identical answers. So she copies a different answer from each person in class. Such is Yuuko's luck that every individual answer she copies is incorrect, resulting in a score of zero.
</li><li> Taken to a beautiful extreme by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NinjaNonsense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NinjaNonsense">Ninja Nonsense</a></em>, which has Onsokumaru attempting to cheat at baseball by causing the ball to multiply itself. It backfires in a spectacular fashion when Miyabi summons a bunch of floating hands to catch every ball, getting Onsokumaru out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> times, winning the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">four</a> games by default in the process.
</li><li> Zigazzed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>; most enemies attempt to cheat Shiro and Sora. They usually lose because Shiro and Sora can cheat a lot <em>better</em>. On the other hand, the siblings never cheat if their enemies don't cheat either and Jibril doesn't cheat ever, no discussion. That said, attempting to cheat Jibril equals a suicide declaration.

</li><li> Team Rocket in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Flame Pokémon-athon" features a race in which one of the competitors, Dario, conspires with Team Rocket to knock his rivals out of the race. He still loses when the Ponyta that Ash is riding evolves into Rapidash and wins the race. Dario, furious at his loss (even having the nerve to call <em>Ash</em> the cheater), orders Dodrio to attack Rapidash, only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleIntheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleIntheSky">kicked off flying into the sky by Rapidash</a>.
</li><li> In "Off The Unbeaten Path", there is a Pokemon competition that both Jessie and James enter separately. Jessie cheats while James is determined to play fair. As is typical of this trope, Jessie loses while James is actually the winner, which goes to show that even someone from Team Rocket can win if he doesn't act like a criminal.
</li><li> Zigzagged and Reconstructed in "A Dancing Debut", where Jessie <em>tries</em> to cheat by getting early details about the Appeal round of the episode's Showcase. When she misreads it and it gives her no lead whatsoever, her team just resort to legitimate methods and win anyway.
</li><li> Also played with in the Sinnoh contests, which were the starting point for Jessie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocketWins">winning coordinator events</a>. Jessie at first assumed this was because James and Meowth had rigged the stage in some way, but they later admit they were out of ideas and had lied, shocking Jessie by making her realise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">she had won solely through competence</a>.
</li><li> Actually a pretty consistent theme in the show. Compare how well Team Rocket tends to do when they play by the rules rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">cheat.</a>
</li><li> They're often shown to actually be competent in battles and competition and have just as close if not closer contests with their Pokemon as Ash and his friends. They're just not very evil.
</li><li> A non-Team Rocket example. Faba was pitted against Ash in the Alola League and decided to cheat by having his Hypno use Psychic to pull Meltan into battle. Unfortunately, he didn't take into account that Meltan eats metal, nor that Hypno's pendulum happens to be made of metal. He suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> when Meltan eats the pendulum, crippling Hypno.

Predictably, they all lost to him.
</li><li> Also, there's the matter of Pegasus, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Millennium Eye and ridiculously over-powered cards</a> definitely grant him an advantage, but the cards are arguably not cheating as, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">he invented the game and he says so</a>. Still, the ability to look at whatever cards your opponent is against the rules he himself made. Kaiba eventually figures out that Pegasus is cheating (though not exactly how), and Yugi/Yami knows about the Eye from the beginning. Both eventually find ways to nullify it (Kaiba by simply not looking at his own hand, and Yugi and Yami by constantly switching between minds so Pegasus can't predict what they're going to do).
</li><li> Earlier on, Dark Yugi spends his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">making sure</a> that people who cheat against him <strike>never prosper</strike> are subject to horrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> for the rest of their lives.

He tries to trip and elbow her, but she still beats him.
</li><li> Most Rare Hunters that Yugi dueled in Battle City cheated too. Seeker used counterfeit Exodia cards that were also marked with ink that only he could see using special contact lenses. He also used multiple Exodia pieces and Graceful Charity copies (although, whether that's illegal in this continuity isn't clear). Mask of Light and Mask of Darkness (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Lumis and Umbra</a>) had microphones hidden under their hoods, letting them communicate with each other in a way that Yugi and Kaiba clearly couldn't. (After stating that a team wasn't allowed to share cards and strategies, no less.) In both cases, the Rare Hunters lost.
</li><li> Pandora/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Arkana</a> was a more blatant cheater: he trimmed the edges of an important card (Dark Magician) so that it landed on top of his deck when Yugi cut it; additionally, in the manga he boasted - to himself - that as a stage magician, he knew over one-hundred ways to cheat at cards. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yugi was on to him, however; after using Card Destruction to ruin his plan (for the moment) he told Pandora that it was clear to him that someone who would risk damaging his cards by "shotgun shuffling" would probably stoop to a trick like that too.</span>

<ul><li> Exactly how much Saiou/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Satorius</a> was cheating in was debatable. (It was clear that the Light of Ruin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveSupernaturalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveSupernaturalPowers">was helping him a little</a>, made more obvious when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">the thing took complete control of him</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>.) However, he <em>blatantly</em> cheated in the fourth season, planting a card called Arcana Force 0 - The Fool in Judai/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Jaden</a>'s deck before the duel, and much like Weevil, using a Spell Card to force him to summon it. Once he had done that, he was able to use its presence in combination with other cards that let him forgo the coin tosses on his luck-based cards, and was able to safely use some of the most dangerous ones, like Tour of Doom and Sowing of the Fool. Unfortunately for him, Judai found a weakness in this strategy, managed to destroy the Fool, and when Saiou had to depend purely on luck for those cards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">it proved outright terrible.</a>
</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>, Judai's first opponent, a teacher applicant named Ryuga, is cheating by using a device that prevents his opponents from using Spell Cards. Judai is put in a tight spot when he's unable to use Fusion, but he manages to turn it around without even finding out what his opponent was doing. (Ryuga is never seen after that story; many fans assume he was fired, especially since losing to Judai meant he failed to fulfill the conditions needed to be recognized as an official professor of the school.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>:
<ul><li> There was Clark Smith, the member of Yliaster who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murdered Sherry LeBlanc's parents (although Sherry does admit that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction">he didn't do it himself, but simply "allowed" it to happen</a>)</span>. When Yusei confronts him, he challenges Yusei to a Concentration Duel, a special duel with house rules with elements of the game Concentration. It's rigged; the cards are all spread out face-down on the table, and Clark knows what his are due to marks on them that only he can read due to his special glasses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yusei realizes he's cheating and wins anyway, and Clark pays dearly after he tries to kill Yusei and Sherry, something that defies the orders of his masters - they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">erase him from existence, literally</a>.</span>
</li><li> Another example was Team Catastrophe. Originally three down-on-their-luck losers from Satellite, the Three Emperors of Yliaster gave them two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Dark Cards</a> that they thought would help them win the WRGP and catapult them to stardom. However, the first of these two cards was Hook the Hidden Knight, a card that housed the spirit of a demon that let them defeat Team Unicorn by sabotaging their D-Wheels, causing their opponents to crash and injuring them. Team Catastrophe didn't fare as well against Team 5D's; after Crow defeated their first duelist and destroyed Hook the Hidden Knight, their leader Nicholas went up against Jack, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and used the second Dark Card, a far more potent one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">he could not control</a>. Nicholas barely escaped with his life, and in the end, he and his two teammates were bigger losers than they were before</span>.
</li><li> Then there was Takasu, the warden of the facility. In his duel with Yusei, he had them both wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockCollar">Shock Collars</a> designed to shock a duelist when he lost Life Points; <em>his</em> was purposely not working. He also used a security camera to look at Yusei's hand during the whole duel; however, this backfired on him <em>badly</em> when another inmate hacked the facility's system to turn his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockCollar">Shock Collar</a> on and then killed the power so that he briefly couldn't use the camera, causing him to make a mistake. (In general, the reason for Takasu's downfall was that he abused the inmates so much, they were all more than willing to help Yusei bring him down.)

<ul><li> The first cheaters in this series were Rikuo and Kaio (called Scorch and Chills in the dub) the original holders of Number 61: Volcasaurus and Number 19: Freezadon, respectively. As if cheating via deck stacking wasn't bad enough, they planned to rob a rare card from a museum and frame Shark for it. (Fortunately, the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">weren't convincing cheaters</a> anyway.)
</li><li> Jin (called Fortuno in the dub) used a hidden camera to spy on the cards in Yuma's hand and relay the info to his D-Gazer, giving him an advantage because some of his cards required guessing the cards in the opponent's hand. Cathy figured it out and destroyed the camera, then Yuma was able to beat him.
</li><li> Tron and his three sons all cheated in some way, and in each case, they were ultimately beaten.
</li><li> V had an incredibly broken monster on his field that was hidden from view, and didn't let Kaito see it until the last second.
</li><li> III stole Yuma's "Kattobing" and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed Astral</span>, deleting both from Yuma's memories, severely diminishing his dueling skills. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Astral got better.</span>
</li><li> IV tricked Shark into peeking in his deck to get him disqualified, and led Shark into a Magma field where his monsters were at a disadvantage.
</li><li> Tron himself used powerful magic to cheat, using his crest's power to eliminate any Trap Cards caught in his way during the Duel Carnival ride. (In his defense, exactly how much this qualifies as cheating is debatable, as Droite was the one who placed most of them deliberately to stop him.)
</li><li> Then there was Mr. Heartland, who didn't even try to hide the fact that he blatantly rigged the duels between his henchmen, the Fearsome Five, and the heroes. Heartland used a device that let Semimaru, Kurage and Mosquito Ninja all start their duels by taking half their opponents life points and adding it to theirs, just because he could. On top of that, Kurage and Mosquito Ninja handicap their opponents with poison and hallucinations respectively, while Semimaru simply discards a Battle Royal rule he doesn't like (not that he takes advantage of discarding that rule...) Nonetheless, they all lost, proving that they were poor duelists who couldn't win even when they <em>didn't care</em> if the heroes knew they were cheating.
</li><li> Inverted with Yuma and Astral, who go so far as to fabricate entirely new cards on the spot to win some of their later duels and do nothing but prosper for it. Granted it's kind of a kill or be killed sort of thing, but still.

Here, Greg, quarterback of the Westdale High football team, suspects that Marcia's new boyfriend, Jerry Rogers (the quarterback from rival Fairview High), is out to steal his team's playbook as his team is struggling to find a way to beat Westdale at the latter's homecoming. After a failed attempt to swipe the playbook during his first visit to the Bradys, Jerry invites himself over again and succeeds in the theft. Greg — instead of reporting to his coach the first theft attempt (especially since Bobby had seen Jerry try to steal the playbook, and thus would have been a reliable witness) — had prepared by creating a phony playbook. The boys laugh about how they've "put one over Jerry," but Mike overhears the boys' revelry and brings them down to earth by saying what he's done was just as dishonest and was unfair to the Fairview players and coaches who were playing by the rules. Eventually, the Fairview High coach finds out about Jerry's theft and kicks him off the team; it is not known what, if anything, happens to Greg ... although he is able to lead Westdale to a 20-7 victory.

</li><li> Game shows have had more than their share, but one lesser-known example comes from the 1980-1981 NBC game show <em>Las Vegas Gambit</em>, a Q&amp;A-type game married to blackjack hosted by Wink Martindale. In an episode that pitted male-female teams of people previously strangers to each other, Martindale asks the question, "From what direction does the east wind blow — east to west or west to east?" The team answers, "West to east," which Martindale momentarily doesn't hear, and asks the team to repeat their answer. Perhaps realizing they gave a wrong answer, they try to change it to "east to west," but the off-stage judge — having heard the original response — signals to Martindale, who immediately snaps at them to repeat their first answer ... which they sheepishly do. To date, it is one of the only times Martindale has been upset (albeit briefly), and even that incident was quickly forgotten. The episode in question, by the way, originally aired in the summer of 1981, and was rerun on November 27 of that year ... the show's last broadcast day. (Incidentally, that airing is far better known for Martindale appearing — during the show's final act — in a box, announcing that the show had been canceled and that <em>The Regis Philbin Show</em> would take over the following Monday.)

However, when doing the test, Mike found that he was able to do the test honestly since he legitimately knew the answers. However, Mike's notes are discovered at the end and the teacher logically assumes he used them to cheat and it takes the rest of the episode for Mike to convince his parents and teacher of the truth. Both to allow him to prove that he knows the material and for his parents and teacher to drive home the point that preparing to cheat is wrong in itself, Mike retakes the test, on top of the desks, barefoot and his underwear to make sure he is using no unauthorized materials.
<ul><li> In another episode, this philosophy is seriously subverted. Ben has the opportunity to cheat on a test, but does not; he ends up getting a bad grade and is scolded by his parents. His friends <em>do</em> cheat, get <em>excellent</em> grades, and are rewarded by their parents. Ben's father is forced to concede that, in reality, cheaters prosper and win very often (saying that "in some cases, they even win the White House", an obvious reference to Watergate), although he does say that being honest can be far more rewarding in the long run.

When the school board director comes to hear the Glee Club rehearsing, Brian enlists Tommy's help once again, but this time the plan fails because Mr. Belding and the school board director encounter Tommy in the hallway on the way to said rehearsal and, assuming Tommy is there for moral support, drag him into the Glee Club classroom, forcing Brian to do his solo part, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">solo</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">It goes as well as one would expect.</a>

The teacher tells them they missed a test that morning and gives them a make-up test. The question worth the most points (or the first question in some versions): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereoFibbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereoFibbing">"Which tire?"</a>
</li><li> Another story tells of a student who stopped by the professor's office to find him missing. He then stole a copy of the next exam. The teacher found out the exam had been stolen, but not by whom. So, he cut half an inch off of the other exams and the cheater was discovered as the one with an exam half an inch too long.
</li><li> Another story simultaneously subverts and plays this trope straight. A music student is required to write a symphony as a final exam and finds an assignment turned in by a previous student (sometimes the professor himself). The student then copies the symphony but reverses it. He turns in the assignment, then gets it back with a failing grade and the message "Why did you turn in Beethoven's Fourth?"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: In the episode "Let's Play Golf", Kaeloo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">cheats</a> at golf by distracting the others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulking Out</a> and hitting the ball. When the others find out, they accuse her of being a "dirty cheater" and Kaeloo proceeds to hit herself over the head with her golf club as a form of self-inflicted punishment.
<ul><li> In Episode 101, Stumpy, Quack Quack and Mr. Cat all cheat in various ways in an Olympics-style sporting event, so Kaeloo gets annoyed and beats them up before crossing the finish line herself and winning.
</li><li> Subverted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Episode 95</span> where Stumpy's team does win after cheating.
</li></ul></li><li> Every episode of <em>Scooby's All-Star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LaffALympics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LaffALympics">Laff-A-Lympics</a></em>. The Rottens cheated in absolutely every event, and almost always came in last. However, this is one of the few shows in which while the results were subsequently discounted due to the team's cheating, several of their tricks during were accepted as not actually being against the rules, and indeed were able to come in first place at the end of the episode, albeit very rarely.
<ul><li> There's one 'pity win' episode where the Rottens get away with every single trick they pull.
</li><li> In one episode, an attempt to cheat didn't help them win, but it did get them a bonus to their score for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">accidentally breaking a world record.</a>
</li><li> Other characters occasionally get called on doing questionable things, but they tend to be less outright cheating and more trying to bend the rules and failing.
</li></ul></li><li> Mertle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em> does this constantly through every contest she and Lilo are in and actually manages to get away with it in some cases. In a dog show contest, she sabotaged Stitch's water bottle by replacing it with a bottle of a particularly strong blend of coffee (if you saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">the first movie</a> then you know what caffeine does to Stitch) and ended up winning the contest, but conceded the trophy because the duo helped rescue her dog (actually an experiment) from Gantu. Another case was that she used an experiment against Lilo (not that Lilo didn't use it first) during a fundraiser and once again won, but she overbinged on the prize (a supply of shave ice) making it a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt">Not Worth It</a>. The trope is played straight during a quiz contest between their two families; Mertle uses one of her friends to feed her the answers through an earpiece. Lilo finds out halfway through the contest and uses the experiment at the time to incapacitate Mertle's helper. Come next round, Mertle's on her own and promptly loses.
<ul><li> There's another case where Lilo and Mertle bet their prized possessions in a baseball game (Lilo her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis</a> records, Mertle her dolls). Lilo thought it was going to be a baseball like they had done at the start of the episode. But Mertle, upon seeing an experiment that would give her an advantage, changed it to a basketball game and had Gantu brought in as a ringer. Ironically she wound up losing thanks to <em>Pleakley</em> who played a similar sport on his planet and was a natural. The look on Mertle's face when she's forced to hold up her end of the bet is pretty satisfying, especially considering she was a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in this episode.
</li><li> In one episode, <em>Lilo</em> was the one who tried to cheat. She and Mertle bet that whoever won an orchid contest at the Kokaua Town Fair would have private access to a secret beach for a week. The problem for Lilo was that she didn't have an orchid in time and was ill-prepared, so she took one of Jumba's experiments, a living plant-like one, and entered it in the fair. However, at the fair, Mertle knocked it over by legitimate accident and the experiment grows out of control to a monstrous size. Despite the chaos it caused, Lilo actually won the blue ribbon, but she realized she didn't win fair and square. So she relinquished the ribbon and the bet to Mertle and also accepted being grounded by Nani for a week (Lilo was accepting of a month, but Nani reduced it as she felt that her sister learned her lesson).

Because Gonzo has never played basketball before, he has a difficult time trying to score points. When he finds out that Bunsen and Beaker's Cant Lose Shoes allow whoever wears them to win any game, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoLookAtTheDistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoLookAtTheDistraction">distracts Bunsen and Beaker</a> so that he can borrow the shoes while they aren't looking. Gonzo manages to catch his score up to that of the Bad Eggs, but his ruse is exposed when he gets the shoes wet and they malfunction. Gonzo agrees to play fair for the rest of the game, and despite his best efforts without the Can't Lose Shoes, the Bad Eggs still win. Thankfully, the Bad Eggs and Gonzo are good sports, and they agree to play another game against each other soon, this time with Gonzo playing fair the whole game.

<ul><li> In the "Fall Weather Friends", Applejack and Rainbow Dash get so competitive with each other, they attempt to cheat one another during a race. In the end, they both come in last. However, in this case, it's justified as they were cheating <em>each other</em> so much they didn't notice everyone else had gotten ahead of them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">They're both formidably athletic, so if they hadn't been busy cheating, they would probably have arrived among the first.</a>

Once the Mane Six and the rest of the Apple family start to outpace the cider machine during the cider contest, Flim and Flam skip the quality control process to get back in the lead. Though this wins them the contest, the resulting product is so terrible that they get run out of town, which would have happened anyway if they lost. At least if they had lost on even terms, it wouldn't have completely ruined their business.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Rarity Takes Manhattan</em>, Suri Polomare basically cheats her way through the fashion industry- she takes advantage of her assistant Coco Pommel for all the actual work, and cheats Rarity by stealing a special fabric (she told Rarity she'd be using it to make accents, but actually used it to copy Rarity's dress designs and claimed the fabric as her own). And while she isn't caught, she doesn't come out well either- Rarity manages to pull off a last-minute fashion line using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">stuff she found around her hotel room</a> that won the contest legitimately, and Coco Pommel is inspired by Rarity's kindness and quits, leaving Suri with no way to actually capitalize on her reputation for making the fabric since Coco was the one who could actually sew and Rarity was the one who knew how to make the fabric.

When they're finally caught when he plays Homer, Homer is anxious to tell everyone, but Smithers convinces him to keep quiet about it, promising that Burns will recommend Marge for the Springfield Country Club if he does; Burn thus gets away scot-free. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And ironically, even though Burns apparently kept that promise, as the club voted to accept Marge, she decided against joining.</span>

Her school lost a Battle of the Bands to a school band from Ogdenville despite the fact that the Odgenville school used glowsticks during the act, as visual aids in the competition are strictly forbidden, and is frustrated when even the judges of the competition didn't care about the rule violation, especially since without them Ogdenville would've still won.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>, Jerry angrily says this straight out to a villain who used robotic implants on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">figure skaters</a> to make them stronger and faster: "When will you learn that cheaters only cheat themselves?"

Dastardly is one of the only characters that tries to deliberately impede the others).
<ul><li> Ironically the one time he did win a race through straight out racing (despite trying to cheat earlier), he was disqualified because he stretched out the cone of his race car to reach the finish line. Despite, you know, <em>every other racer having similar devices on their cars</em>. Apparently, it's all right to use them during the race except the last leg of it. Then again, it was pretty early in the series.
</li><li> Even more ironically, Dick Dastardly almost won a race through legitimate means (shouting as he did so, "I'm going to win this race fair and square even if I have to cheat to do it!") but stopped short of the finish line because Muttley wanted his autograph. The debut episode had him stop to pose when the narrator exclaimed the race would end in a photo finish.

</li><li> In the 2013 season, the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers was standing just a little too close to the out-of-bounds area as an opposing team's running back was headed for the endzone. While the coach jumped out of the way, it was clear that he'd done it to distract the opposing player, and the coach was fined by the NFL.
</li><li> During the early '80s, the old Southwest Conference in college football had rampant recruiting violations by every member ("if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying"), and Southern Methodist University got smacked with the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University_football_scandal">"death penalty"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1987 - sanctions so harsh the program has never recovered from them.

<ul><li> Pete Rose was part of a gambling scandal that labeled him permanently ineligible from Major League Baseball, disqualifying him from the Hall of Fame. As if that weren't enough, he was convicted of tax evasion and spent five months in jail for it.
</li><li> Though players like Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Roger Clemens aren't banned from the MLB Hall of Fame, voters have taken an understandably dim view of steroid users and rejected their bids by wide margins. This despite the many other users who fell well short of Hall of Fame numbers even <em>with</em> steroids, proving that it still takes talent to be that good.
<ul><li> The cases of Bonds and Clemens are considered especially interesting. The book <em>Game of Shadows</em> documents Bonds's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">massive ego</a> getting the better of him after his historic accomplishment in the 1998 season — becoming the first player in Major League history with 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases — was completely overshadowed by McGwire and Sosa's home run race (ending up with 70 and 66 home runs, respectively). While the start of Clemens's usage isn't as well documented, the prevailing suspicion is that after four disappointing and injury-plagued seasons from 1993 to 1996, he turned to PEDs to revitalize his career, as he showed a marked return to the form he'd shown in his prime, winning the award for best pitcher in the American League in both 1997 and 1998. Like Bonds, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">ego</a> proved to be his undoing.

There's a sizeable contingent of fans, drivers (such as Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who was right behind Bowyer and had the best view), <em>and</em> quite a few commentators who believe that Bowyer intentionally spun himself out in an attempt to benefit teammate Martin Truex, Jr. NASCAR almost immediately announced that the incident was under review, and on the following Monday, NASCAR threw the book at Bowyer and his racing team: Bowyer lost fifty points, throwing him down to 12th in the Chase seeding and already more than a full race behind 11th place. His team (and two others) were also hit with owner point penalties, along with a $300,000 fine, and GM of Competition Ty Norris was indefinitely suspended.

The doping scandals are further apart than they used to be, where most of the doping scandals in the 2013 media are old ones (Armstrong, Hamilton, Dekker, Rasmussen). This has led to the joke that the best way to become a Tour De France winner is simply to finish. Even if you're in last place, sooner or later everybody ahead of you will be disqualified.
</li><li> Marion Jones was the darling of Olympic Track &amp; Field. However, after getting linked to an insurance fraud racket, Jones was forced to admit she used steroids in order to reduce her jail time. She gave a public speech admitting she cheated and was stripped of all her medals. Since then, Jones has been trying to make a comeback in different sports, but so far nothing successful has come of it. To be just, Victor Conte, her drug supplier, made it clear that she was actually competing on an equal level, because most if not all of the athletes she competed with, were also using steroids. Given that other athletes worldwide tested positive in future Olympic games since the scandal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie">Conte might be telling the truth.</a>

<ul><li> The 2006 Italian football scandal known as "Calciopoli", where national powerhouse team Juventus was shown to be in cahoots with other teams such as Milan, Lazio, Reggina and Fiorentina for rigging matches on their favor by picking referees that favored Juventus. The result? Juventus was stripped of their 2004-05 and 2005-06 Serie A titles and was forcibly relegated to Serie B for the 2006-07 season, while Fiorentina and Lazio were denied a place respectively in the Champions League and the UEFA Cup. Milan was deducted 30 points from their 2005-06 campaign, while Reggina merely had a $70,000 fine and had their president banned from all football activities for two-and-a-half years.
</li><li> France was also hit by a football scandal in 1993. Olympique de Marseille was crowned champion in the 1992-93 French First Division for the fourth consecutive time by winning 1-0 against relegation-threatened Valenciennes. However, allegations came afloat that OM bribed Valenciennes to deliberately throw the match so that Marseille can be better prepared for their Champions League final against Milan. Valenciennes player Jacques Glassmann, however, refused to take part in the bribe and helped French police to solve the case. Marseille were stripped of their national title and were relegated to Division 2 for the next season, but second-placed Paris Saint-Germain turned down the offer to take the title for themselves. Despite this, though, Marseille's plans seem to have worked, as they later on defeated Milan 1-0 to claim the first (and currently only) Champions League in the current format won by a French side.
</li></ul></li><li> In the boxing world, Antonio Margarito was a feared power puncher that had knockout power in both hands and a rock hard chin. Even the great Floyd Mayweather Jr. seemed afraid to fight him, or so his critics will have you believe. Margarito was a big middleweight that could make the welterweight division. His most famous victory was against Miguel Cotto, whom he battered savagely that night, breaking his jaw. Then came the night Margarito was to fight "Sugar" Shane Mosley. Mosley's trainer discovered Margarito's people loading his gloves with liquid plaster, which got hard after getting wet. It already had dried blood on it, suggesting it was used many times before. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, Margarito got knocked out by Shane Mosley the same night. Margarito, who no longer had punching power, was exposed as a cheater and nicknamed "Margacheato".

</li><li> In 2013, Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd tried to stall the end of an NBA game by telling one of his players to "hit me" and make him spill his beverage, forcing a time-out. Not only did the Nets lose, but the NBA found out what he had done, and fined Kidd $50,000.
</li><li> The college admissions scandal of 2019, especially after it was revealed that well-known actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin (AKA: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Aunt Becky</a>) had taken part in efforts to get a college admission exam rigged so that their daughters could be admitted into a college. Both eventually pled guilty, however, this trope especially applies to Lori Loughlin who pleaded not guilty at first. Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 2 weeks in prison for her role. She was also fined $30,000, and has to perform 250 hours of community service.
