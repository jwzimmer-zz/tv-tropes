If the backstory involves a child wallowing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">angst</a> because of having no parents, to bring them back and treat everything as being hunky-dory sort of dilutes the origin story's dramatic impact.
</p><p>Sometimes, though, a parent can be brought back through use of a proper excuse. A parent who we have seen or heard nothing of in some time may suddenly re-appear and explain that there was, in fact, a very good reason for the abandonment — but for various reasons, the details could not be revealed until just this moment. This is particularly important if child is going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">follow in their parent's footsteps</a>, since we would normally expect them to be bitter if this is the career that caused them to get abandoned in the first place.

</p><p>This trope straddles a thin line — it can come off as extremely contrived unless said excuse is very, very convincing. In order for it to work there must be an explanation as to why no one bothered to bring it up until just the last minute.

<ul><li> In the soft-core <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a> manga <em>Aki Sora</em>, siblings Sora, Nami, and Aki Aoi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">(who had been having an incestuous affair)</a></span> were long ago abandoned by their father, and had not seen him since, even when their mother died. When their father was on his deathbed, Sora still refused to forgive him after such a long time. Which is why Aki talks him down by explaining that he left because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> of the scandal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">having sired all three of the siblings with one of his younger twin sisters.</a></span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arachnid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arachnid">Arachnid</a></em>, an assassin named Jin Togawa is forced to be promoted as the "Suzumebachi" frontman of The Organization with the threat of several other hitmen hidden around him and his pregnant wife's life on the line. Jin complies, but the supernatural process <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">brainwashes</a> him to the Boss' will and makes him a deadbeat dad who can only look after his now miserable family from afar. Him still being able to do that results in the Boss spitefully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">ordering their deaths anyway</a>. Suzumebachi kills his wife but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">too disgusted</a> to wait for his daughter and finish the job. That daughter is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist Alice, who is manipulated into becoming a formidable assassin herself. For further injury, Jin is killed as he confesses all of this to Alice, not for spilling the beans but just because the Boss needs him dead for Alice to replace him.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> After 5 years of wondering where his father ran off to, Eren finally learns the reason Grisha abandoned him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a>.

His mother claims this is the only thing preventing the family from being together, but this proven to be a complete lie. Just before beginning his mission, Reiner went to meet his father and was promptly rejected by the <em>terrified</em> man. He claimed Karina was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a>, so bent on revenge that she'd use her own son to expose their crime.</span>

This is only in <em>Black Jack 21</em> however; in the original manga this is most definitely averted with Kagemitsu being an incredibly selfish jerk.
</li><li> Played mostly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> with Kallen Stadtfeld <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and her birth mother, who is actually the incompetent family maid Miss Kouzuki. Kallen assumes her mother stayed on to continue to be her father's mistress, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter">treats her poorly</a> and puts a sticker over her face on a family photo. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">dramatic moment</a> when she discovers her mother actually remained out of love for Kallen, but didn't want to give away the fact Kallen is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">half-"breed"</a>, and as her mother is jailed, she swears to make Miss Kouzuki her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>, later taking the sticker out of the photo. Thank God, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> we see Miss Kouzuki free and in her path to recovery, living modestly but happily with a Kallen who's now back to Ashford Academy.</span>
<ul><li> Played with in <em>R2</em>, where Lelouch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> discovers his father's reason for abandoning him and his sister in a foreign country was to protect them from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">brother</a>, who had murdered Lelouch's mother out of jealousy. On the other hands, Lelouch immediately points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> is Not Cool, and that if his parents had really been as concerned about the well-being of their kids as they claimed, they would have figured out a way to protect them <em>without</em> heavily traumatizing one and crippling another, and then invading the nation whose leader had him and his sister as a political hostage... thus nullifying any need for living hostages.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Yuuki Anzai of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DevilsLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DevilsLine">Devils' Line</a></em> was raised believing himself to be an orphan, only to discover in his early twenties that not only are <em>both</em> his parents alive and well, but that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were respectively a scientist and patient in the research branch of the orphanage he was raised in</span>. As for why they never contacted him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they legally couldn't. Yuuki was conceived as part of a scientific experiment on the hybridization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">devils</a> and ordinary humans; and while Midori and Tamaki were voluntary egg and sperm donors, taking part required them to sign away their custody rights and ability to contact him. That, and Tamaki is a convicted mass murderer.</span>
</li><li> Goku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> spent most of Gohan's and pretty much all of Goten's childhood's dead or off training. Ultimately both cases stemmed from the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">he was trying to keep them safe.</a>
<ul><li> Though when he is around/alive, he really does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">try to be the best father he can to them</a>. Points for effort, though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor">Spirited Competitor</a> causes issues in what he <em>thinks</em> are good parenting decisions — he learns his lesson when he goes too far during the Cell saga, just in time to realize his folly and sacrifice himself for Gohan. Until then, though, <em>his former archenemy</em> comes off as a better parent to his eldest son than he is.
</li></ul></li><li> Renton Thurston in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO">Eureka Seven AO</a></em> wasn't there for Ao and Eureka due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being stuck fighting Scubs and Secrets in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> universe</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And had Eureka stayed, the trapar would have killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Ao</a> like it did his stillborn older sister.</span>

Also, Doctor Strange said so and people tend to do as Strange says, if only because not doing it tends to make you wish that you had (not because of anything he does, but because the consequences of not doing it tend to be pretty horrible).

The fact that she didn't properly hand custody off to the state and ensure that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Billy</span> was in a stable environment (and where she could visit him) spoke volumes about how she cared more about unburdening herself from being a parent than his well-being.

<ul><li> This is a major theme in literary treatments of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend">King Arthur</a></em> myth, where the young Arthur is given away by his father Uther Pendragon to be raised either by Merlin or Sir Ector. The reason for this varies depending on the version of the Arthur myth — often it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">because prophetic Merlin tells Uther he has to do this</a>. Part of it depends on when Arthur was conceived, which is under discussion. In Geoffrey of Monmouth's version, his conception occurs before his parents married, with Uther magically assuming the shape of Igraine's first husband Gorlois. In this case, Arthur would have appeared to the world to be Gorlois' son, calling his legitimacy as Uther's heir into question. On the other hand, Thomas Malory was obsessed with legitimacy and therefore stresses that Arthur was only conceived after the death of Gorlois and the wedding of Uther Pendragon and Igraine, necessitating a different rationale to explain why Arthur's claim to the throne had to be established by pulling the Sword from the Stone (and anvil).
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryStewart">Mary Stewart's</a> Merlin trilogy, Uther knows that Arthur is his son but sends him away on Merlin's advice for Arthur's own safety and the security of future legitimate heirs (who are never born).

Because Seph's mother, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Linda Downey</span>, was fighting the system of the Wizard Guilds at the time he was born, she knew he would be in danger if anyone ever found out his parentage, and thus leaves him to a foster mother to keep him safe.

<ul><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Remus Lupin</span> attempts to invoke this trope, believing that it would better for him to die heroically or abandon his pregnant wife rather than have her and his unborn child suffer because of his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lycanthropy</span>.

</li><li> The father of <em>Demon Princess</em>'s protagonist was first in line for the throne, which also carried the responsibility of making sure nothing bad gets through portals to the human world. The way, when the current demon king/queen dies, the heir is immediately transported to the castle and can never leave. While he was with the protagonist's mother, his father died and he was called back, giving him no time to explain or say good-bye. He decided that she wouldn't even believe the explanation, so he never made contact with his family until he learns about his daughter and her latent powers.

This isn't <em>wrong,</em> really, but given how flighty her mothering already was and how unforgiving Senna generally is, she takes this as more of an excuse than a justification. (Senna's father could also count for the first seven years of her life—he didn't know about her at all until Senna's mom dropped her off and literally vanished.)

When his human friend Felicia talks to the woman (named Ruth), she mentions that she was called to sing at a cruise since the previous singer couldn't make it, but she couldn't take Waggit with her. Since she was sure that he hated being in the kennels, she decided to leave him at her brother's farm until the cruise is over, but she was shocked when she heard that Waggit had run away.

Ayla cannot take Durc with her because travelling to locations unknown in the wilderness is difficult enough without a young child to look after and he would likely be considered dead as well, cutting him off from the Clan permanently. Ayla knows he'll be alright because Uba and Brun will care for him, though they're both still devastated. A few years later, in <em>The Mammoth Hunters</em>, Ayla seriously considers trying to find Durc and bringing him to live with her at the Lion Camp. However, in the end she decides against this, partly out of practicality (she has no idea where his clan is living now or how to find them) and partly because she realizes it would be unfair to Durc - he has spent his whole life with the Clan and has a place amongst them, whilst he would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfBreedDiscrimination">discriminated against</a> amongst Cro-Magnon and have a much more difficult life.

Before the series began, Andy was a famous surgeon who hardly ever spent any time with his kids (the show kicks off when his wife's death forces him to change). At one point, his son Ephram comments bitterly on the fact that, since his dad was always off saving lives, he can't even be angry at him without feeling like a bad person.
<ul><li> Andy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival">Friendly Rival</a>, Harold, had a similar situation growing up: his mom Edna, a nurse, volunteered during the Vietnam War, and while she says she wanted to help people, he feels like she just wanted adventure and neglected the rest of the family to get it.

When the T &amp; T Circus stops in a small town, sharpshooter Bonnie Stevens encounters the husband and son she abandoned years before, and she is forced to explain why she did so. She was feeling stifled and slowly going insane on the isolated ranch, so she left the child with the ranch foreman's wife (who had no children and who she knew would dote on the boy) because she new life on the road was no life for a small child.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Jon Snow</a> grows up believing his mother gave him up to his father Lord Eddard Stark, he having had an affair with Jon's mother. He doesn't know anything about her as Ned never speaks of her; he doesn't know if she cares about him or if she's even still alive. Ned promises that the next time they see each other, he'll tell him about his mother...but this doesn't pan out due to Ned's untimely death. It's revealed much later in the series why Jon's mothers gave him up and it's a <em>very</em> good reason: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother is Ned's late sister Lyanna and his real biological father is Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, who eloped with Lyanna rather than kidnapping her as most people believed. After the Targaryens were overthrown during Robert's Rebellion, Lyanna begged Ned to protect Jon as she feared Robert Baratheon and his supporters would kill him, shortly before she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">died of childbirth complications</a></span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFosters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFosters">The Fosters</a></em>, the twins eventually meet their biological father and learn that he was already 18 when they were conceived, whereas their mother was only 15 and her parents pressed the issue, landing him on the sex offender registry.
</li><li> Deconstructed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em> with Herc and Zeus. Herc grew up wanting to meet his father, but also resenting him for effectively abandoning him before he was even born. Of course, Zeus is the king of all gods; even Herc acknowledged what a big, consuming job that is. It's demonstrated that Zeus has always protected Hercules from his various enemies on Olympus and was secretly in contact with Alcmene for much of Herc's childhood. Still, the overall experience left Hercules with a lot of emotional baggage that he still struggles with as an adult, alternating between wanting to embrace his father and resenting him at a moment's notice. Zeus choosing to engage in an affair rather than prevent Hera from killing Herc's wife and kids only made it worse. Every encounter between them afterwards is a tense affair.
<ul><li> The spin-off, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungHercules">Young Hercules</a></em>, stayed true to this, but also added a few new wrinkles. Since he hasn't even met Zeus at this point in his life, Hercules is downright obsessive in trying to get the attention of a father literally at the top of the world. On multiple occasions, he risks his life and/or endangers his friends simply because the word "Zeus" came up. In the final episode, Zeus appears in disguise and talks to Hercules about having a son he loves dearly but is not close to; he acknowledges his failings as a parent and feels staying away is better.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> with Maury Parkman. After Matt tracks his father down, Maury hugs him and pretends to be sorry he left. However, Maury then uses his telepathic powers to trick Matt and Nathan into fighting each other.
<ul><li> Played straight during Season 3 when Maury performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and works for Arthur Petrelli in exchange to ensure his son's safety.

She was pregnant and never told him. He meets his daughter when her mother is murdered.
</li><li> While a number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows have characters with daddy issues, this particular trope is a bit less common:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em> portrays Sokichi Narumi as the epitome of a badass detective and all-around great man, which makes it strange that he's so detached from his only child that she doesn't know he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a>. It's not until after the show that one of the follow-up movies provides an explanation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a bomb in his hand that would go off if he ever came near the person he loved most</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost">Kamen Rider Ghost</a></em> rather abruptly brings up secondary Rider Makoto Fukami's daddy issues in the show's second half as part of the tie-in to the summer movie featuring said father, who turns out to have abandoned his son and daughter in a failed effort to keep them from being dragged into the show's central conflict.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em> remake has the character from the original show giving his son an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">It's Not You, It's My Enemies</a> excuse for not being around.
</li><li> Done very sympathetically on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> where the team investigates a congressman who has spent 80 grand on a prostitute. However, they find out that he never had sex with her, and was giving her money to get her out of that business. She doesn't know that he is her father, and he is portrayed as someone who gave up his child for adoption but regretted it. The fact that he has no hesitation to sacrifice his reputation and political career in order to protect her from the scandal counts a lot toward making him so sympathetic.
</li><li> Dr. Mondo Tatsumi, the father of the titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyukyuSentaiGoGoV">Kyukyu Sentai GoGoV</a></em>, left his family ten years before the start of the series because he predicted the coming of a horde of demons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThePlanetsAlign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThePlanetsAlign">during the Grand Cross</a> of 1999. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert">When nobody believed him</a>, he went underground to develop the means to fight them.

However, this act earned Katrina the ire of her coven, and she left Jeremy in the care of trusted friends to protect him. She ended up captured and sold out to Moloch by her coven, and Jeremy was left alone. Unfortunately, Jeremy's life ends up going south soon after that, and when he reunites with parents 200 years later he is not happy, and has no time for Katrina's excuses.</span>

We later learn that he left behind a wife and son, both of whom are understandably bitter with him for his abandonment. They eventually come to understand that he left for the greater good because he realized that the Tau'ri would be valuable allies in overthrowing the Goa'uld.

It then turns out that the woman had died not long afterwards and her son had ended up a street-rat and a petty crook, and was understandably not very pleased that his father hadn't bothered showing up until he was an adult. That the only reason Picard knew he existed was because a Ferengi with a grudge against him was threatening his son's life really didn't help. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then it turns out he's not actually Jean-Luc's son...</span>

<ul><li> Except in the last panel of the same comic, she says, "Perhaps I did something to displease him... or he wants nothing more to do with me."

</li><li> Chapter 31 reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Antimony's mother literally gave her "fire" (A.K.A. life force) to her, and wasted away after the birth, ever so slowly, while Annie grew up. Reynardine implies even her soul "vanished".</span> Not only that, but EVERY adult near Annie knew it would happen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if Surma ever had a child, and the same thing would happen to Annie. While not confirmed, it's speculated that he left to find a cure for this.</span>
</li><li> Chapter 53 reveals his apparent (possibly faked) reasons: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anthony never found out exactly why Surma died, so he travelled the world trying to find some closure. The main reason why he abandoned his daughter is because he felt that she didn't deserve to live with the man who murdered her mother. He had enough resolve to literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">carve</a> out his right hand to create a spiritual antenna... then almost starved himself under a blazing sun when he realized that he was killing Antimony.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the webcomic <em>Bizarre Uprising</em>, Mitsu's father (secretly a vampire) abandons him and his mother when he was young. He did this beause He's the vampire Messiah and if the other vamps found out he was still alive, they'd try and drag him back, almost certainly killing Mistu and Biana in the process. He stayed in Mitsu's life as "The Pig", the school mascot, turned Mitsu's mentor in the ways of vampireness.

She is quite aloof towards her children, leaving them for months or even years at a time at boarding schools or under the care of a slave or older sibling. Quil'yate explains to Ariel that this is not because the drow are evil, but because the clan believes that it is best for young nobles to learn to prove themselves, so that they can be strong leaders. This however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">should be taken with a grain of salt</a>, since it also turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Quain isn't really Ariel's mother, but rather her grandmother; Ariel is the daughter of her 'crazy sister' Mel'arnach, and Zhor, an elf magically turned into a spider; Quain forced the unlikely couple to give up Ariel (including an apparent attempt to kill Zhor while they were at it), thinking the two could not provide a proper environment for a future clan matriarch and wanting to take the credit for herself. Quain is also unable to have children, and it's strongly implied that the desire to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">suitable heir</a> is part of her motivation as well.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, Gilgamesh Wulfenbach was raised as though he were just another of Baron Klaus Wulfenbach's royal hostages from the conquest of Europe.

He had in fact been kidnapped and imprisoned by demons and was thus unable to help his family when they needed him the most. Although he claims that he managed to flee from demons, the truth ends up being much more horrific: he was actually tortured and brainwashed to become a servant of the dark god Mardük and was ordered to return to the world of mortals to make sure his sons would fulfill an ancient prophecy which would result in Mardük's resurrection and a full-scale demon invasion. He eventually breaks free from the god's taint but at that point it's too late because his actions end up causing the Cataclysm as well as turning his son into a bitter person. He does his best trying to set things straight and regain his sons' trust.
</li><li> One of the major driving questions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DarwinsSoldiers">Chasing Seconds</a></em> is why Junior's dad left his family to jump through the Einstein-Rosen bridge. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out he was saving the human race from a deadly plague.</span>

In the early days, a man gets turned into a polar bear, but doesn't realize it's happened to others (Since he lives out in the frozen boonies of Canada) and tries to live a normal life... until while on a Seal Hunting trip he ends up mauling a seal with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">bear</a> hands, at which point he becomes terrified of what he's become and runs out into the frozen tundra to live as the beast he has become, leaving his wife and two sons behind.

As it turns out, she was quite surprised when she found out that Homer believed her to be dead. The misunderstanding came up because (1) Grandpa Simpson was unwilling to reveal to young Homer that his mother was a criminal (she was rather ticked off by this), and (2) Homer's mistreatment of his mail carrier prevented any of her care packages from reaching him until he specifically asked about them. It's what happens when you don't tip them on Christmas.
<ul><li> Also, we're led to believe Nelson's father abandoned him. Turns out his peanut allergy caused circus dwellers to kidnap him and use him as an attraction. Thanks to Simpsons' negative continuity, he is never referred to again.

Realizing she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail">pass for "normal,"</a> her parents left her at an Orphanarium when she was a baby with a note in an alien language, allowing her to live on the surface rather than as a second-class citizen in the sewers.

Sokka harbors no resentment and is happy to reunite with his father, but Katara at least still felt abandoned. She even says that she knew and understood Hakoda did what he had to do, but she couldn't help feeling angry for not having him there when she needed him the most. They make up at the end of the episode, though.
