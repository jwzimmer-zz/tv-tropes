<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES">Older Than the NES</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Adventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Adventure">Adventure</a></em> on the Atari 2600. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">bat that steals your items</a> in some game modes can be captured and then released in an empty castle with whatever it is holding at the time. Sometimes it will immediately make a break for the door, but often it will start flying through the rooms of the castle in search of another item to steal. Since the bat will never change direction unless it sees another item it will never attempt to leave. This works even in the Gold castle, which only has one room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> Dracula in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Order of Ecclesia</a></em> will abort whatever attack he's using and raise a wall of flame if you try to use the flight glyph Volaticus to avoid his attacks. This attack can be dodged if you move towards him while flying, so you can make him abort <em>all</em> his much more annoying regular attacks.
</li><li> While most people consider Julius Belmont of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Aria of Sorrow</a></em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, you can easily beat him by double jumping and kicking him in the head repeatedly if you took the time to get the air kick ability soul from the Kicker Skeleton in the same area. This works on Richter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait of Ruin</a></em> too  the only moves that would hit you are well telegraphed. Paranoia's first form in <em>Dawn of Sorrow</em> breaks if the player's directly above him, allowing you to bounce up and down on his head while he spins helplessly in place. Dead Crusaders from the same game will not even try to block the kick, allowing you to defeat them easily using the same technique.
</li><li> Similarly, Julius Belmont is also incredibly vulnerable to the handgun weapon for this reason: he simply has no means to retaliate against attacks with that much range because he was never programmed with any kind of tactic to deal with it. It'll take a while, but you can just keep running away shooting while he helplessly chases you whipping at nothing, like a vampire-themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow">Benny Hill</a> skit.
</li><li> Astarte in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDespair">Harmony of Despair</a></em> (and possibly in her original game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait of Ruin</a></em>) will attack at whatever location you were last at, but thanks to the overall slowness of some of her attacks, the fact that she walks around slowly between attacks, and the other fact that she's human-sized and thus easily jumped over, you can just jump over any of her attacks, stand still until she finishes, jump over her again, and watch her slowly march where you were and attack thin air. You can easily have her facing the wrong way for most of the battle, making her relatively easy to kill since she has no attacks that hit behind her besides her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> Temptation. However, this does tend to bite you in the ass in multiplayer, since there is more than 1 target for her to attack and you can't tell who she's aiming for unless the entire team manages to stay on one side of her.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Portrait of Ruin</em>, the otherwise powerful Dullahan becomes a joke if you can get one character on each side of him  he'll keep turning from one to the other endlessly. It's hard to set this up, but worth it on the game's higher-difficulty modes.
</li><li> In addition, Dracula's first form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCurseOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCurseOfDarkness">Curse of Darkness</a></em> can be caught in an infinite combo through use of the weapon Hien. By repeating the weapon's first attack over and over, you can end the battle before he does anything. It stops you from stealing from him, but that form doesn't have anything important anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The Invert ability, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">flips the whole world and everything in it except for you upside down</a>, completely and utterly <em>destroys</em> the AI of a number of enemies as it seems most of them simply weren't programmed to account for you being up on the roof like that, allowing you to just run past a number of annoying encounters. It even works on a number of bosses, most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Demon Carpenter</a>, being <em>so</em> effective that it reduces him from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">savage fight for survival</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherBoss">a complete joke who can't even hit you</a> and gives free access to one of the most effective shards in the game and a buttload of experience.
</li><li> Though not to the same level as Invert, the Bunnymorphosis soul that allows you to transform into one of the Lili minor enemies and utilize their entire moveset is rather broken when mastered because practically none of the enemies have any means at all to counter its aerial kicking attacks and will continue to behave as if Miriam were using her standard abilities. Coupled with the ability's surprising boost to attack power, it's the easiest way to utterly cheese Valefar.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> Komato Sentinel Proxima's AI has a few bugs in it, making it possible to trap it into a non-attacking infinite loop. The creator actually pointed this out in a Youtube video of how to beat it. It may have been intentional, given that Proxima is a robot in-game.
</li><li> The AI of a normally overpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Komato Annihilator</a> can be exploited to have it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">destroy itself with its enormous firepower</a> in certain areas. If Iji jumps up onto a wall that the Annihilator cannot reach or break down and stays in front of the Annihilator, the AI's typical reaction would be to fire the Shocksplinter or Splintergun at Iji. This causes the weapon's explosions to rebound against the wall and back onto the Annihilator, dealing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">Splash Damage</a>. Have the AI repeat this several times trying to damage Iji, and eventually it will explode upon running out of health.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>: If you force the Golden Torizo against the wall of the room you fight it in and move close enough to it, then it will stay in place and all of its attacks will miss you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Screw Attack will kill Gandraya in 6 hits. Hilarious if you let her grab you, because when she disengages, she is at the perfect Screw Attack distance.
</li><li> Omega Ridley is programmed to follow a set pattern with his attacks, but he is also programmed to drop whatever he is doing and jump to the side should you try to attack him with the Screw Attack. Players can exploit this behavior by initiating the Screw Attack when Omega Ridley is charging up a powerful, time-consuming, or hard-to-dodge attack, forcing the AI to swap it for an easily dodged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em>, several bosses could have been serious trouble in low-percent runs if their AI hadn't been cracked wide open. You can safely <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metroid2002.com/0/boss_tricks_ridley.php">stand under Ridley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> forever (just don't rapidfire), Mother Brain's own ledge is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metroid2002.com/0/boss_tricks_mother_brain.php">the perfect hiding place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Chozo Test won't use its better attack if you never stop moving, and the Black Pirates can be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metroid2002.com/0/boss_tricks_black_pirates.php">lured to a spot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where you can pick them off at your leisure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, Elite Pirates have to face you straight-on once before they start attacking. If you strafe around them, they'll just keep turning, making them easy to kill. (Just don't bump into anything or try to change direction.) This works on the Phazon Elite and even on Omega Pirate, though in his case it's only possible for the first armored phase.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Blue Fokka</a> on the "correct" route through the Great Palace has an AI hiccup where, by standing a pillar of four blocks (the room it appears in just so happens to make this very easy), ducking, and stabbing as he jumps up to try and hit you, you'll smack him in the head and leave him to keep trying, making it very easy to dispatch it. The second one, however, does not show up in a room where this is possible. In fact, a lot of enemies in the game seem oddly unable to handle a jumping crouch stab.
</li><li> The end boss, Link's Shadow, is among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">hardest</a> bosses in the NES era... unless you stand on the far left, duck, and just sit there stabbing over and over. The boss AI will repeatedly walk right into your sword, leading to an easy victory. Most ROM hacks add lava or some other deadly hazard on the leftmost tile to disallow this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyByRegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyByRegion">Incidentally, the original FDS version did not have this</a>; it was caused by an RNG bug common in FDS to NES ports.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em>: The boss of the seventh dungeon is normally very difficult boss, but if you enter the fight with the L-2 sword and charged with a Piece of Power, you can kill it while it's in its (fairly easy) first phase, because it doesn't enter the (<em>much</em> more difficult) second phase until it's been hit three times — and with the powered-up L-2 sword, three times is all you need. The Fire Rod from the eighth dungeon (which can be reached early via a specific invincibility trick, or by grabbing the Mirror Shield from dungeon 7, then exiting) will also end the battle in the first phase.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, the Water Temple might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>, but both its bosses are extremely vulnerable to specific tactics:
<ul><li> Dark Link can't handle the Broken Giant's Knife, as he defends against it as if it were the full unbroken blade. Just hold forward and thrust, and you'll absolutely murder Dark Link in no time. Biggoron's Sword is just as effective, since it's too large for him to block or deflect. Failing this, if you have one of the earlier releases of the game (later versions have him run out of range when you cast it), you can bring Din's Fire and a couple green potions, which he <em>also</em> can't defend against, to deal with him effortlessly.

Stand in the doorway and fire on it until it flies toward you, then back up far enough away (about three hops) and stop firing.

Climb up, open fire, and repeat when it reaches the halfway point again. Ideally you don't want it to get close enough to pound its fists.

One of the reasons for this is if you try to shoot him, he will knock your bullet away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">with a bullet of his own.</a> However, while he's shooting your bullets, he's vulnerable to attack.

<ul><li> You can also jump on top of the altar in the room.

He won't land a single hit on you.
</li><li> For all his perfect reaction time and judgement while on the defensive, Dante also turns out to have some pretty horrible judgement about the best ways to attack. The computer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">is NOT actually a cheating bastard this time,</a> and Dante has the same recovery frame animations that a player has when controlling him. Therefore, an easy way to beat this otherwise nightmare-ish enemy is to simply hover around the very edge of his attack range, coaxing him into a combo that he will almost certainly miss, and then retaliating with a a combo of your own just as his is winding down. It seems obvious, until you realize that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">usually a game that is heavily, heavily biased towards an incredibly aggressive playstyle.</a>

This is a very difficult task, as the angels are fast and have a powerful attack, while the capture stream slam is very hard to aim well. But, if you stand right in front of the gate and strafe left and right, the angels will crash into it while trying to charge you and complete it for you.

</li><li> AI units in the online game <em>Bearbarians</em> tend to jump up in fairly similar locations each time. By taking the enemy flag but not dropping it off, picking this point to defend, and attacking whenever you see an opponent jumping up, you can stack up massive amounts of bonus damage due to the combo rules, enabling you to carve through hundreds of opponents with almost ridiculous ease before you get bored, reach the level-up you were aiming for, or see your left hand drop off. Your allies can't take the flag off you, and will be free to deal with any opponent to evade your brutal 1000+ raw damage swings.
</li><li> Ardeth Bay is an early boss in <em>The Mummy Returns</em> for Imhotep, though he's unbeatable and you simply need to distract him long enough to let the train start rolling out of Cairo. Turns out Imhotep can perform front kicks faster than Bay can recover from the impact, allowing the player to simply spam kick him in the face until he's backed into a corner and completely harmless.

The AI never uses Awakening, or even accumulates charge, so if the player switches away from controlling her she's only going to move around and lose health, and deploying her in an AI-only slot is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">outright liability</a> since she does nothing an Archer couldn't do better.

<ul><li> The AI really doesn't know what to do against archers at long range. As long as you are outside of an enemy's "aggro range" you can pepper it with arrows until it dies... and the enemy will never move, and never attack, unless they possess ranged attacks of their own. Normally mitigated by the fact that the "aggro range" is normally larger than the effective range of a bow, this can be mitigated by rings that either make your character harder to detect (in <em>Demon's Souls</em>) or increase your bow's effective range (in <em>Dark Souls</em>). The AI also has somewhat bad pathfinding over these ranges, so even if your character is in aggro range, the enemy that you hit is just as likely to run off a cliff or get stuck on the terrain as he is to reach you. Of course, when the player is hit with arrows sometimes they'll freak out and run off a cliff too while trying to figure out where it's coming from and roll out of the way, so it's pretty balanced.
</li><li> Similarly, it's entirely possible - albeit very difficult - to defeat certain bosses without even going through the fog gates. Since they're not considered "activated", the bosses will just stand there while you pepper them until they die.
</li><li> Enemies throughout the <em>Souls</em> games, particularly larger ones, often have serious issues with doorways. Luring them into narrow halls or doors can get them stuck and form traffic jams while they helplessly go through their attack animations, allowing players to pick them off at leisure. This can be an exceedingly helpful tactic to thin out dangerous areas or pick off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>.

Except that this also works on boss AI too, leading to some... very <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">interesting</a></em> effects on some fights.

All a player would have to do is hop down, attack once or twice, then get back up. Repeat until the whole gang was cleared from the screen.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>, various MAP attacks aren't fun, since they either amount to powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Spheres Of Destruction</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a>. In either case, the accuracy means most of your units will get hit, and most of <em>those</em> will die after one or two shots. However... if the attack would hit even <em>one</em> other enemy unit, they won't use them.
<ul><li> Another way to work around these is to move four characters who know Alert and have the Regen 10 SP skill surround the MAP able enemy and move all other units out of the MAPs attack range, eventually, since MAPs are all ammo based, a patient player can wait for it to use up these moves and then move in.
</li><li> In some SRWs the AI uses their MAPWs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">indiscriminately,</a> most notably in <em>A</em> and <em>OG2</em>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em>, the computer would always primarily use an attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Super effective against you.</a> So what happens when an enemy has the move Agility available and you have a Poison-type out? Well, Agility is a Psychic-type attack (even though it has no offensive use and just raises the user's Speed), so the computer would spam Agility! BRILLIANT! Oh, and the best part: The computer has infinite PP, so they will never stop using Agility! This happened most famously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemonRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemonRed">Twitch Plays Pokémon Red</a></em>, where the poisonous Venomoth of the player(s) beat Lance's Dragon-type Pokémon who spammed Agility, which instantly gave the Venomoth many, many levels in sheer badass.
</li><li> They would also use attacks Super Effective against their foe's type even if said foe had another type to cancel it out. Take, for example, Poisonpowder. Super effective against Grass, but did nothing to Poison-types. And did you know that every single Pokémon in the Celadon Gym had Poisonpowder? A brand new, Level 5 Bulbasaur never took damage once because the foes would only use Poisonpowder, which Bulbasaur was immune to. And, thanks to the blatant lack of Poison moves in the first generation, that was the only Poison move any of them knew, since the only other options were Poison Sting and Sludge, which none of them could learn, and Acid, which none of them had.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Stadium</a> 2</em>, Gym Leader Chuck is programmed to lead with the move DynamicPunch and then use the best possible move after it hits. If you use a Ghost-type Pokémon, which are immune to the move, Chuck will continue to use DynamicPunch, giving you 5 free turns to KO each of his Pokémon. This even works in Round 2!
</li><li> Similarly, Bruno of the Elite Four in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonHeartGoldAndSoulSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonHeartGoldAndSoulSilver">Pokemon Heart Gold And Soul Silver</a></em> will start with Counter, a move that does twice as much damage to its opponent as its user received that turn. If the user took no damage, Counter does nothing. Bruno will continue using Counter even if your Pokémon does nothing but boost itself, allowing you to fully set up and sweep his whole team.
</li><li> Prior to Generation IV, computer players (unlike human players) almost never switch out their Pokémon, even if the matchup is extremely unfavorable for them. If you use Trick to give them a Choice item and lock them into using a single move, then you can switch to a Pokémon that resists that move and setup to your heart's desire. Amazingly, the computer won't switch even if they're forced to Struggle.
<ul><li> Even in Gen V AI trainers still switch out so rarely that for one to do so is an event in itself. They're gained the sense to switch out if a Choice item is forcing them to use an ineffective move, but you can now break them in a different way by having a Durant use Entrainment to pass the Truant ability onto them, or utilizing Skill Swap. This forces them to only act every other turn, which can be abused by any Pokémon with a stat boosting move and Protect to keep them from taking damage on the turns where their opponent can attack. Once again, this tactic could easily be countered by simply switching Pokémon, but they won't, presumably because they're still capable of choosing moves that <em>could</em> hurt you, if not for Protect. That said, a Double Battle plus Skill Swap removing Truant from Slaking still equals big trouble. Truant is meant as a balancing factor since Slaking is stronger than many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. Therefore, Truant would much rather be on anything else-and the AI has been aware of this since Generation III.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">the fifth generation</a>, Zoroark's Illusion ability is a stumper for the AI. It always believes that a disguised Zoroark is really whatever it is disguised as, and the disguise is only broken when Zoroark takes damage. Since Zoroark is outright immune to Psychic moves, they won't cause the illusion to drop, so if Zoroark is disguised as something Psychic-weak and the opponent has a Psychic attack, it will pointlessly try to Psychic Zoroark, never catching on that it doesn't work, allowing Zoroark to buff itself to insane stats. This trick still works in later games.
<ul><li> This is particularly noteworthy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> during your climactic final slowdown with the story's central legendary Pokemon. It's way more powerful than anything else you'll encounter until the credits, and can easily steamroll an unprepared team. However, the legendary's most threatening move is a Psychic-type attack, and you can get a Zorua early in the first island which will happily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> it every round.

Being Fire and Ground type, it has double weakness to water. It also happens to have an ability Desolate Land, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovedAchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovedAchillesHeel">completely negates water attacks</a>. Despite that your enemies will keep spamming water attacks to no effect whatsoever. Over and over.

Even computer players at the Battle Tree will do this, which is supposed to be the AI at its smartest, though it will switch after two turns of nothing. Outside of the Battle Tree though, the AI will never stop trying the move for as long as it's available.

If you end your turn with all of your units out of reach from most melee-based enemies, they'll sit there doing nothing. One powerful spear technique, Avalanche, deals a lot of damage and then sends you flying backwards quite a long way. You can then set up a chain throw to clear the spearman and everyone else out of there. So long as the monster behaves like this, you can run in and Avalanche to escape as long as you like, and the monster will be none the wiser. This doesn't always work because some monsters behave differently — it's probably not going to work on a fast monster, but it's really handy when it does, allowing you to handily defeat enemies you otherwise couldn't without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>.

It is especially useful in the Item World, and even more when you use it against pirates, who can have levels around five or six times those of your best units. With this strategy, you can basically throw all you have at them, while they stay in the same spot, allowing you to kill them, slowly but surely, and even better: safely.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has a <em>very</em> difficult boss called World Balance, so tough that its entry under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> theorizes it has an adaptive AI. However, if you put up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Magic Mirror</a>, World Balance throws a tantrum and starts spamming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">Almighty</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> spell Megidolaon at you.

While one would think this fight would be hard, the AI only attacks once per turn as opposed to twice like most bosses. And, it will always use Tarukaja, the Attack Up spell, if he doesn't already have boosted offense. By using Dekaja on him to dispel the attack boost at every possible opportunity, he'll never attack.
</li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> who is, if you fight him normally, <em>incredibly</em> hard. He has a bunch of extremely powerful Black-element attacks, and any time you try to use a spell or skill against him, he immediately counters with an opposite-element reaction. The problem? Countering <em>uses his turn</em>. He becomes pathetically easy once you realize that all you have to do is have one person equip the armor that absorbs Black and spam White spells, and the other two spam Red: he'll keep blasting the first one with a devastating Black-element attack which now <em>heals</em> them, and hitting the other two with a debuff that reduces their evasion rate but doesn't actually cause any damage. This is particularly handy because it lets you get Serge's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">way before you're supposed to</a>.

However, they can't end their turn in an occupied square, and they can't double back on their own path. If you put a unit just close enough that they should be able to charge it, then put three more units in the three adjacent squares they'd charge past your nearest unit to reach, they'll get confused and move to the one open square adjacent to your nearest unit—which not only prevents them from damaging that unit, but allows your four nearby units to gang up on them on the following turn. (Note that this does not apply if the enemy unit has a significantly shorter movement range than your nearest unit—they'll try to flee instead.)
<ul><li> And if you use an archer or magic user from the right range, the enemy won't move at all under normal circumstances. Of course, the game's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>.

Once the enemy team is irreparably out of position, you then pass the ball to one of your strikers and have them go for the now very lonely goalie.
<ul><li> Sometimes you can sit behind your own goalie with the ball, and the enemy AI will never come to attack, letting you while you simply wait out the clock and win once you have even a single point lead. It doesn't always work though.

Moreover, Provoke costs nothing to use. Have Tidus use Provoke and the battle becomes impossible to lose. Provoke lasts until Tidus switches out, which you will never need to do, as its damage rounds down so it cannot kill, even if you are reduced to 1 HP.

But Gravity 100 can be reflected; cast Float on a single party member and equip him with a Wall Ring before the fight starts and he will simply cast Gravity 100 turn after turn, making him harmless.
<ul><li> The boss in the same room as Catastrophe, Azulmagia, acts like a Blue Mage in that he will "learn" any blue magic that you hit him with and attempt to use it on you. Even if the spell would be completely useless, like L3 Flare (which he is able to be hit by) against a team with no eligible for L3 Flare. Even if the attack is <em>Selfdestruct</em>.

However, with the correct strategy, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGTJ9Qc6VU">one can trap him in a loop where he never gets to use his desperation move<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, removing most of the difficulty.
</li><li> In the <em>Final Mix</em> version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Unknown (a.k.a. Xemnas) is normally extremely difficult, but there's an easy way to get him stuck in a loop. Not only is Gravity the one spell type he's not immune to, it also stuns him for a ridiculously long time if it lands. Stun him with it, get in a combo while trying to blow him back to the centre of the arena, jump slightly back while casting Gravity, and jump over the electric balls to reach him and repeat the whole process. He can break out of it for his final phase spinning laser attack and his fourth-wall-breaking command menu attack, but the former is rare and can be Cure-spammed through and he's too polite to use the latter while a summon is visiting, which ever so coincidentally also stops Donald and Goofy from interfering with your combo. Summon Genie and Bambi, tell them to do absolutely nothing and loop the combo until you win.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, Luxord will refuse to attack after triggering his ultimate attack's Reaction Command (the one where he surrounds Sora with a wall of cards) until Sora moves. If you have a good lead in Time after he uses it, you can just stand there and wait for his Time to run out without being threatened.
</li><li> In the <em>Final Mix</em> version, it's possible to AI-loop Roxas with a certain strategy, though it requires very strict timing and only works up to when he uses Keyblade Release for the first time. Equip the Rumbling Rose Keyblade, Finishing Plus, two Combo Pluses and Guard Break. When the battle starts, Guard his initial attack, then combo into Guard Break. After he lands, do another combo into Guard Break. He'll counter with Aerial Spin Swing, so cast Reflega to block it, then immediately follow with another Guard Break. Let Roxas land again, combo into Guard Break, Reflega, and repeat. It's not a foolproof strategy, since Roxas has a few times during the battle where he's programmed to retaliate when his HP reaches a certain point, but if you can react to those counters, you can keep him in a loop until he either uses Keyblade Release or you win.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, the AI will target the centre of your Gummi ship. However, your Gummi ship uses the hitbox of its actual design. As such, a Gummi ship with a <em>giant hole in the middle</em> can cruise through a lot of the ship levels because the enemy will be firing at a point on the ship that doesn't actually contain any <em>ship</em>.

Normally this would make the battle a grind, but it's possible to begin casting a spell, cancel it, and then run away from his spell's area of effect. With two players one player can distract him by canceling spells and running away while the other either whales on him with impunity while he tries to hit player one with spells or casts spells of their own to kill him quickly.

In particular, Hyoh of the Delta Star in season 2 will go into his buff rotation if they're not active. Considering how ridiculously easy it is to have abilities that can dispel said buffs (to the point that a player would have to actively avoid them), this means that fights with Hyoh are mostly spent with one character dispelling him and the rest of the party piling on damage. Hyoh's rematches eventually tend to throw in an attack or two even on rounds he spends buffing, but he still tends to fall prey to this strategy.

Thanks to his Dragon Buster sword, he has an attack that can instantly kill a character who is in their Dragoon form. However, by this point in the game it's possible to have two Talisman accessories, which makes the wearer immune to instant-kill attacks. If a Talisman-wearing character goes into their Dragoon form, Lloyd will spend most of his turns trying to kill them instead of fighting you normally.

Two of the easier to perform are Xianghua's Great Wall and Iron Sword/Strife's A+ B. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a> itself, this is completely fair.
<ul><li> The thief/Chester's bomb throw, B+K, can be charged and rolled. If you charge and roll the bombs, the enemy will more likely than not block it, because charged bombs have guard stagger this will cause the enemy to be forced into a stagger animation that not even the computer can get out of, quickly roll another charged one to land a hit and knock them down, then do it again, as the CPU can't skip the period between getting up and blocking low. Another easy one is staff/Hualin's front A+B, if you do it right then you can knock the enemy down and then keep pointing at them as they get up, as they will guard but the attack breaks the guards.
<ul><li> Another reliable move in the third game is Kilik's Biting Phoenix (or Seong Mi-Na's Fang Barrage). The AI almost always fails to block either the first two jabs or the final jab.
</li></ul></li><li> A really neat trick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburIV">Soulcalibur IV</a></em> involves the final, topmost floor of the Tower of Lost Souls, where you face a severely souped-up version of the game's final boss... who can, however, easily be defeated by letting him knock you over, and then roll yourself on the floor so you're between him and the edge. He'll then do a jump over you—straight off the edge of the tower, plunging to his death. By far the fastest way to make money in the game...
<ul><li> Sadly, this has been patched. However, throwing is once again an anti-AI move (it worked well in the second game), and thankfully it works against him. You see, no matter how high an opponent's defense is (theoretically, the final boss's defense is as high as it will go), throws always deal full damage. Plus, the computer doesn't grapple break as often as it did in the third game.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in <em>Soulcalibur IV</em>, using Yoshimitsu's Bullet Cutter attack will break the AI. The Bullet Cutter can be held, which will turn it from a normal attack into an unblockable attack. The response of the AI will be to block until it reaches its unblockable state, then try to attack. By releasing it shortly after it becomes unblockable and then quickly starting it up again, it's possible (and usually quite easy) to beat even the hardest AI without them landing a scratch on you.

Brawl</a></em>, but the most memorable trick is probably the "Fly To Survive" scheme... only usable with the handful of characters who possess limited flight capabilities, and mostly useful for the Cruel Brawl survival-test, where you face a bunch of <em>seriously</em> overpowered bots... but by simple constantly flying <em>under</em> the island the battle takes place on - hanging off the ledge on either side to reset your flight-time counter - you can trick the AI into jumping off the screen with a little practice.
</li><li> In the previous game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Melee</a></em>, one famous enemy was Donkey Kong who had one tactic if the opponent stayed still on his stage. Charge, jump, jump, flip-hammer-punch. Unfortunately for him, his flip-hammer-punch disables his ability to hang on to edges, you spawn on a fairly small platform, and to properly hit you, he has to miss your platform by a bit, over one of the few levels in the game where you can't really recover from a fall—particularly since his timing puts him into the ground just when an instant death enemy jumps up to bite at people's heels...
</li><li> In <em>Melee</em>, all you have to do to get easy wins is make your opponent a maximum-difficulty Roy, turn off items, play in Jungle Japes, KO Roy once, and stand on the far right side of the stage. He WILL fall to his death over and over and over again when he tries to go directly from the respawn platform to your platform and misses the jump.
<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> like Captain Falcon and Mario are programmed to leap off-stage and make a lazy attempt to hit you with a meteor smash to prevent you from recovering. However, they're not intelligent enough to account for their greatly increased falling speed while affected by a Metal Box and will still attempt to do this, KOing themselves in the process. Encountering one of them as the penultimate foe in Classic mode is basically a free ticket to victory.
</li><li> You could also battle a Luigi in both of the Mushroom Kingdom stages. Luigi's AI has him use his Green Missile for recoveries, so spiking him into one of the small pits causes Luigi to use the move, hit the wall, and fall to his death.
</li><li> Even easier, level nine Ness on Jungle Japes, 1 stock match. Do nothing. He jumps toward you, tries to recover, falls down the hole between your platform and the main one, hits the side of the stage with PK Thunder, continues to fall, and dies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Even</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">easier,</a></em> just leave Ness at level 1. He will do the same thing, minus PK Thunder.
</li><li> Also, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">the original game</a>, you could defeat Pikachu on Story Mode without even touching him by just jumping around the tower on the right, causing Pikachu to Quick Attack himself off of the platform.
</li><li> It's also possible to do something similar with Fox in the original game: stand near the nose of the Great Fox and wait for him to charge you, then jump over him. Fox will be unable to recover, and will either fall off the screen or land on the Great Fox's lasers, at which point it's only a matter of time before the lasers fire and he asplodes.
</li></ul></li><li> The 15-Minute Melee can be mostly beaten with just Donkey Kong's hand slap, made especially easy as the Wireframes hardly ever use items to slow you down (plus they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">an alarming tendency of placing mines on the platform on which they're standing</a>, if they pick them up). The developers were probably aware of this; surviving for all 15 minutes unlocks the N64 Donkey Kong stage.
<ul><li> While it was helpful in the long run and probably anticipated (along with Fox/Falco's side-B) explosive items had a nasty tendency to drop where you were banging the ground, especially near the end...
</li></ul></li><li> CPU players can't cope with spikes, falling platforms or most custom stages, so one of the easiest ways to beat even the highest level opponents is simply to make your own level with those elements and just play on that.
</li><li> <em>Brawl</em>'s stage editor allows for all sorts of bizarre computer player behavior. For instance, if you create a square, open at the top, on the upper-right corner of the stage and it's the correct size, Lucas will spend the entire match jumping back and forth.
<ul><li> Zelda (who is considered a terrible fighter against any human) can easily beat any AI controlled character on flat stages by spamming her Din's Fire attack and slowly blasting the enemy to one side of the screen. The computer has literally no defense to this strategy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em>, the Corneria stage can lead to many hilarious suicides when a powerful item (such as a Laser sword or a Bullet Bill) spawns or is thrown by the player on the ship's cannon. High-level AI opponents will ignore you to grab the most powerful item in the area, and either miss the jump, fail to jump back on the ship proper, or be blasted out by the cannon firing.
<ul><li> While the AI in the previous Smash Bros. games made little to no effort to defend themselves while returning to the stage, this is no longer the case, and they'll use their inhuman reaction times to airdodge virtually everything you throw at them. Problem is, they place a higher priority on doing this then actually making it back to the stage, and can thus be fooled into dodging attacks until they've fallen too far to survive or at least forced into a position where interrupting their recovery move is easier.
</li><li> Also, they are programmed to airdodge every time you input an attack, even if you are a mile away, and (in the case of charged attacks like Smash attacks) they never take into account if you released the attack or not, but instead they will act as if you had tried to hit them with a quick move. With proper timing, this will result in the CPU airdodging then coming straight into the attack, over and over. Similarly, if you charge a Side or Down Smash, they will also try to roll into you the moment you start charging, with predictably hilarious results.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports">Wii Sports</a></em>'s boxing, the player can literally get their rank off the chart (and if they go at it long enough, off the screen!) by simply weaving back and forth, then countering when the AI throws a punch. A human player can just aim where you are going to be.
</li><li> The AI in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KenseiSacredFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KenseiSacredFist">Kensei: Sacred Fist</a></em> is programmed to always counterattack as it's rising from a knockdown, regardless of how close or far the player is standing. It's remarkably easy to exploit this by simply standing out of range of the attack and knocking them down again before they can recover, repeated until they stop getting back up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Burst Limit</em>, several of the hardest challenges can be overcome by spamming Vegeta's 'Final Flash' super-move... apparently, the AI considers it a '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">super beam</a>' attack, and duly sidesteps it — only, the Final Flash is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> cone, meaning that they step straight into it (instead of blocking, which would greatly reduce the damage). And because the AI considers dodging to be better than blocking, the higher the level of the AI is, the more likely it is to fall for this...
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Ultimate Tenkaichi</em>, almost all AI opponents will become completely helpless if you stay directly above them at blast range, allowing you to bombard them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Manipulation</a> at will. Most characters' shots can't hit straight up at all and the the few that can won't get too many hits in compared to you shooting down (although, some characters can't shoot down all that well, either). The AI is too stupid to fly up to you or run farther away to aim.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoShippudenUltimateNinjaStormGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoShippudenUltimateNinjaStormGenerations">Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations</a></em>, Itachi got a new move, Clone Jutsu: Super Explosion. What it does is create a clone of Itachi that walks forward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">veeeeeery sloooooowly</a> and explodes when touched or attacked. A human player can easily just sidestep it, but for some reason the AI falls for it every time and walks, or even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">dashes</a></em> right into it. This makes getting through Itachi's story <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRQrMovAefQ">laughably easy.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> In the <em>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes</em> games for PSP, the recommended tactic is to use the backwards doubletap, tricking the AI to rush forward to catch up to you, during which is he vulnerable to a forward doubletap rush leading into a combo he will be unable to counter out of. Rinse and repeat through the insane difficulty story mode.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the early versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> had a bug where you could simply continually walk backwards and sweep the opponent whenever he got too close, and win every match this way until you get to Goro. The later arcade versions, as well as the home versions, fixed this.
<ul><li> Also, Shang Tsung can be easily defeated by crouching and kicking out whenever he approaches.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> every AI-controlled opponent up to Kintaro can be defeated by allowing them to walk just into throw distance (or avoiding any projectile attacks sent the player's way beforehand), jumping backward, and then round-house or forward jump-kicking them when they inevitably jump forward. This trick was <em>not</em> altered in the home console or PC versions, but it only works when playing on Player 1 side; it doesn't work when playing as Player 2.
<ul><li> Shao Kahn can be defeated in two ways: some characters (though not all) can repeatedly jump-kick forward until Kahn is pushed against the corner, then jump all the way back to the other side of the arena and repeat. All characters can repeatedly jump over Kahn and kick him when coming down. With either tactic he'll block most of the attacks, but even blocked attacks take some health so this trick allows players to slowly whittle him down to nothing with relative ease.
</li><li> An even easier method is to retreat into the corner and block low. Kahn will 99% of the time, perform his shoulder charge, which you will block, leaving him wide open to an uppercut which will damage him more than the damage you take from blocking his shoulder charge. The other 1% of the time he will taunt you, in which case you throw a projectile at his stupid face then go back to low blocking. Doing this will result in a guaranteed victory, which is a welcome relief after Kintaro.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3">Mortal Kombat 3</a></em>, <em>UMK3</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em> all have the "hypnotic walk" glitch: if you are about jump distance from the AI, start to walk backwards and forwards alternately for a few steps. This causes the AI to copy your pattern, and as long as you keep it up, the AI will not do anything else. This allows players to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI">Perfect-Play A.I.</a>: once they managed to land a hit, they could exploit this glitch and continue to dazzle the AI until time runs out. This yields tedious but easy wins. Of course, landing a hit on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPlayAI">Perfect-Play A.I.</a> is tricky in the first place...
<ul><li> Sheeva players can spam her teleport stomp against Shao Kahn or Motaro, who will begin blocking the move at the earliest opportunity (any CPU controlled playable character would walk/run off the stomp and punish with a combo). Since the stomp also places Sheeva on a safe spot after its conclusion, it can be repeated ad nauseam until they die of chip damage.
</li><li> Rain players in the CD version of Trilogy can hit the AI with a Mind Control Orb into Lightning bolt combo without fail. Repeat with another Orb into Bolt or Super Roundhouse. For bosses, Mind Control Orb into a High Kick. Even on the hardest difficulty.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>, too, has methods to break the AI: by using characters that can teleport, the player can easily figure out the AI's patterns and fool them into attacking thin air. This is very useful in the final battle of Story Mode (Raiden vs. Shao Kahn): when you teleport as Kahn is about to attack (or in the process of attacking, depending on how good your timing is), you'll reappear behind him, while he's open for a free hit. After he's hit, he'll immediately try to attack you head-on most of the time; just teleport behind him again and strike him before he can turn. It's a slow and steady win.
<ul><li> Stryker has a nifty trick against Shao Kahn (and possibly Goro and Kintaro too, can't remember). All you do is back up against the wall and start shooting. If you continuously spam Stryker's gun, you'll keep Kahn on the other side of the screen, unable to get near you. As a bonus, spamming special attacks fills your Special gauge rather quickly; you can work this into the strategy by using the enhanced version of the gun move, in which Stryker fires four shots with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">two guns</a> very fast, amplifying the damage.
</li><li> Ermac's teleport punch works pretty well too. It can be done in mid-air (thus helping you avoid the Shokans' ground-pounding), is a nifty combo opener, and also helps avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">that nasty flying hammer</a>.
</li><li> A sure-fire method to take out the Shokans easily with any character: keep jumping backwards to give yourself some breathing room (it also helps you to see the fireballs coming). More often than not, they will try to hit you with a Teleport Stomp. That's your cue to perform any normal aerial attack, but your timing must be good enough that you can hit them on their way down. At the very worst, if you're not cornered, they will miss you, but you can flying kick them out of the Stomp even at the corner of the stage. Picking up someone who has a projectile is even better - you can hit them while they stop to cheer for themselves, scoring you free hits in the process.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> All the robots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneMustFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneMustFall">One Must Fall</a></em> have strategies that the computer always seems to fall for. Perhaps the most mind-numbing one is to just keep using the Nova's crouching sweep kick. The computer never blocks it and will just walk into it over and over again. Likewise, the computer doesn't know how to dodge the Shadow Grab. And possibly the first one that every player learns is fierce low kick right off the start of the fight, which pretty much no computer opponent will ever stop.
<ul><li> It also has serious problems with the Jaguar's overhead throw.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>, the AI can't dodge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Shantotto's</a> bio correctly, so it often ends up getting hit or dodging into either a stage hazard or another one of her attacks. The AI will just randomly spam dodges whenever one of her air spells is anywhere near them, unless bio is also near them at which point they don't dodge and get hit by both of them.
<ul><li> Also, when you start charging an attack outside of their reach, the AI gets really confused and doesn't know what to do, even if it's not damaging. Strange enough, they look even more confused if it's not damaging: try <em>EX-Charge</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Gabranth</a> a few meters away and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">look at that enemy running in small circles and blocking every other second</a>.
</li><li> In addition, if you put it into a Bravery Trap while in Chase, it will never dodge. Since the AI will rarely dodge Chase attacks to their Bravery if you have enough to oneshot them already, it's very easy to send them into a trap to guarantee that they won't dodge the hit to their health.
</li><li> A rather specific one makes the hardest level Chaos comically easy. Attempting an HP attack (which are usually slow, heavy attacks) right at the start of the fight will cause Chaos to ALWAYS respond with a quick forward swipe that is guaranteed to hit and interrupt your poor character before their attack can launch. Which backfires hilariously when your starting move is an instantaneous counter 'Delta Attack', as Exdeath. As the AI is absurdly aggressive (and thus predictable), Chaos will launch himself right into Exdeath's counter with amusing results, without fail. And you can do this each of the three rounds you take on Chaos in any encounter. (Bonus points if you have enough Brave to finish Chaos in one hit- Exdeath can drop the god of discord in three seconds with one button.)
</li><li> <em>Duodecim</em> takes this even further with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Yuna's</a> Mega Flare. Just watch as the pinned enemy eats a face full of purple lasers, unable to do a damned thing.
</li><li> Also added by <em>Duodecim</em> was "EX Revenge" which triggered instead of EX Mode if you tried to activate it while being hit. Why this is relevant is Gabranth. Gabranth's only real HP Attacks (which end EX Revenge) are while he's in EX Mode, otherwise he can only use EX Charge. So forcing an AI Gabranth into Ex Revenge will cause it to rapid-fire EX Charge (which is best used as a constant "attack") when it would be more effective for it to use Brave Attacks to try and Break you.
</li><li> Feral Chaos, normally an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a>. It's not uncommon for him to wipe out almost your entire party. And yet, he falls easily enough against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Kuja</a>, raining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Ultima</a> spells while gliding at the very top of the arena.
<ul><li> He can also be destroyed by Golbez constantly spamming "Night Glow," due to the attack starting with a shield that deflects Feral Chaos' attacks, followed by a damaging move that smacks him straight into the ceiling.
</li><li> An even easier method involves using Lightning's Scourge attack in midair. Scourge slams Feral Chaos to the ground, and if you're above him, he'll retaliate with a fast but easy to dodge upper attack to bring him to your level. You can then Scourge him back down again, allowing you to easily whittle down his Bravery. Once you're actually ready to do damage, instead of Scourge, you quickly switch to Ravager and use Army of One, which he doesn't even try to block. It can take a long time, but it's an almost guaranteed win.
</li><li> Fittingly enough, using Feral Chaos against the computer makes most battles a piece of cake despite the heavy handicaps imposed on him: the AI doesn't have any real idea on how to dodge Via Dolorosa, which is a pair of rapidly-moving flame pillars that are aimed at the enemy, meaning that they'll almost always get hit by the second pillar after dodging the first one.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, the computer is helpless against E. Honda's command throw if you use it just as the AI is getting up after a knockdown. This conveniently leaves you standing right over them, ready for another throw. It will also repeatedly walk into Zangief's spinning lariat. Individual characters also have their own AI flaws — at a certain distance, Honda will always jump into fireballs, allowing you to spam them relentlessly; and Blanka will always attempt to block some multi-hit specials with a Focus Attack, which does not work.
<ul><li> Focus Attacks, as a whole. Only a few characters are programmed to react properly, the vast majority of the cast will just stand next to you and wait until it fully charges, only to try to block it — and it's unblockable once it is fully charged. Sometimes they try to attack you with a regular move, then all you have to do is release the charge to stun them and follow up with anything. It works on all difficulties, and makes getting enough Perfects to face the bonus bosses trivial.
<ul><li> Following immediately with a Focus Attack Dash Cancel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23uqo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23uqo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23uqo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Double tapping forward, consuming an EX bar to skip over the recovery animation of the Focus attack, enabling you to launch a follow-up counter or ultra before the opponent hits the ground</span> is just icing on the cake.
</li></ul></li><li> One specific to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Round Two Seth</a> is exploiting his tendency to jump backwards and then wall-jump forwards: hang back, jump over his Sonic Booms a couple of times, and hit him with any sort of rising attack. Repeat as necessary.
<ul><li> Seth does also not react well to Ibuki's Neck Breaker special, as his height makes it possible for Ibuki's slide to travel right under his Sonic Booms (and unlike Sagat, Seth has no low projectile variant). As Ibuki hops away a short distance after each successful throw, the player merely has to back up far enough following each attack to lock Seth into a cycle of doing nothing other than throwing Sonic Booms at you, making it rather easy to go to town with nothing but that one move of hers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>, Guile has an exploitable glitch, especially by Ryu or Ken. Do a Shoryuken at the right distance and Guile will do a Flash Kick that completely misses, leaving him open to attack.
<ul><li> Balrog (boxer) in the original game is amazingly vulnerable to simply walking up and punching him in the face, if your character has enough range on his or her fierce punch. It takes decent timing, but once you get it down, he can be very easily humiliated with certain characters.
</li><li> In Super Street Fighter II, new character Fei Long does not seem to be able to handle characters in a crouching block. He will either try some random kicking attacks which do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>, or attempt to do a jumping kick, allowing him to be easily knocked out of the sky by characters who have an upward attack while in the crouched position (e.g. Ryu, Ken, Guile). The AI can't seem to realize that it can simply whittle your health slowly by attacking you while you're blocking, and will shortly try to jump attack and get knocked out of the sky.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> XX Accent Core</em>, the AI will not waggle its virtual stick to get out of stagger. With correct timing this allows you to repeat certain attacks (Ky's forward HS, for example) almost indefinitely, when a human opponent would be able to break out easily. Also, the computer will almost never block Slayer's charging punch, even after you've used it a dozen times in a row.
</li><li> AI Wrestlers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WWFNoMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WWFNoMercy">WWF No Mercy</a></em> can be consistently baited into running at you, if you repeatedly sprint back and forth yourself. As wrestlers cannot counter most moves while running, this allows the player to bypass the impossibly frequent counters the CPU will otherwise pull off on higher difficulties.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em>, you can easily beat Fulgore by dashing in, stopping right before you're in range, and jumping back. Repeat this for long enough, and Fulgore will try and uppercut you, leaving him open for an attack. You can do this for the entire match and he won't stop.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>, Arcade Mode on highest difficulty has the AI reading inputs. It seems VERY difficult at first, but the purpose may have been to let first time players know just how important and game changing assists can be, as they can perfectly counter a single opponent, but will be forced to turtle or do unsafe moves once you start throwing assists out. However, there IS one character in particular that can force the AI to drop difficulty level without assists (though the difficulty is still high enough you should probably use assists as well): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Phoenix</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Wright</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Investigation Mode</a>, he is able to call out Maya to help him, which works similar to the aforementioned assists. Unblockables can be set up with Maya's low hitting slide combined with Wright's slip-up overhead, and the AI becomes notably less defensive when Maya shield is called out (letting you get pot shots by throwing bad evidence, or simply using the proper assist). They also have trouble against his zoning in Trial Mode, and it's easier than it should be to land a random Objection, especially if they called out their own assist (which they'll be doing a lot), letting you go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Turnabout Mode</a> and spam projectiles and finger pointing. Due to his ridiculous damage output, it doesn't even matter if they perfectly block because they'll still receive insane chip damage. And if you land a hit, or they start to use unsafe tactics, you can throw out his Level 3 (the second strongest hyper in the game, beaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Vergil's</a> Level 4 with a measly 10 HP) and kill or cripple a character. Combined with the long animation, you can time out everyone. The AI tries to counter you with uppercuts every time you're above it, so if you just do a divekick with a gargantuan amount of priority like Foot Dive or bait the uppercut the AI will fall for it every time. The AI usually won't attack unless the attack is sure to connect, which means ghost rider jumping S from a safe distance is the easiest way to win.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fighting game spin-offs, the AI is easy to completely humiliate even by newbies in Lunatic mode, by continually suppressing them with delayed projectiles (this is best done with spam-capable characters like Sakuya or Yuyuko) or punishing them with counter attacks and reversals. Also, Suwako's AI tends to freeze when sitting on her lily pad.
</li><li> The AI in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> Tag Tournament 2</em> has a flaw where it will always try to rush at you if it is at a certain range. This means that if timed correctly, a player of any skill level can beat even high level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> by simply spamming flying kicks and dash punches. Even boss Jun/Unknown will fall for this.
<ul><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> 6</em> you can get free shots at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Azazel</a> by knocking him to the ground and spamming him with charged attacks. The AI's default behavior when this happens is to not move an inch as most of the charged attacks are mid-range and would normally miss, but due to his size, Azazel still takes damage from mid-range attacks when he is laying down.
</li><li> In <em>Tekken 2</em>, it was possible to get a perfect against Lei Wulong simply by crouching and approaching him, because his AI would start performing his double-backhand in that situation. Simply wait until he was retracting his fist from the second backhand and use a throw command to hit him with a powerful behind-the-back throw. He would fall for this every time, though in later titles he lost this weakness.

Most of the AI opponents in the game can't even get close enough to hit Xavier when he's spamming the move, and will likely lose to chip damage before they even get a hit in.

Ray Fillet's strong crouching kick caused him to slide forward, and the AI failed to recognize the slide and wouldn't try to block it. By spamming this one move, the game could be beaten fairly easily even on the hardest difficulty.

<ul><li> In early versions, the AI would simply futz around while you were in the air. For single jumps this isn't a problem, but given that a lot of characters have double jumps or air dashes (or in some cases both) you could get free seconds to think or set up moves. Even worse, Painwheel has an extended flight ability, during which they would not know what to do. This has since been patched out.
</li><li> The computer is really bad at dealing with overhead attacks (that's any standing attack that specifically must be blocked high, whereas most can be blocked high or low). There aren't that many of these in the game, but even on higher difficulties those characters that have them will find the computer rarely blocks them successfully. This means that it's always worth doing all three hits of Eliza's heavy punch combo, even if the first two are straight-up blocked. The heavy version of Fukua's Forever A Clone special is an overhead with a range of up to half the screen - against characters without spammable projectiles or fast dash attacks, this may as well be a forcefield.
</li><li> While Filia is normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> for Fukua's Arcade mode due to buffed health and AI that's always on the hardest difficulty, said AI has serious trouble countering Fukua's Inevitable Snuggle grapple. And since it has super armor you can safely run up to Filia and use it first thing. Timing it as she gets up from the last one leads to an inevitable loop that leads to her eventual defeat.

Her action skill, Phasewalk, lets the Siren turn invisible and increases her run speed. If she exits Phasewalk while out of line of sight of Crawmerax and all his cronies the boss would effectively de-aggro and stand around, doing nothing. This time could then be used to reload guns, regenerate shields and health, and wait for a safe attack to his weak spot on his back, effectively turning the boss trivial.

If you hide under or behind certain props or level geometry, the cops will either make no attempt to flank you out of your hiding spot or very few cops will actually rush you. The AI is also broken when it comes to player priorities. In certain maps, if three players huddle together in one room and the fourth player goes off on his own, the cops will ignore the lone player most of the time, allowing him to do all the objectives. Likewise, some maps can break the enemy AI by having a lone player hide in a particular spot, causing the cops to focus on him and ignore the other three players.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em>, one of the components of the enemies' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a> is that they dodge projectile attacks... except that only applies to non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">hitscan</a> weapons that invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery">No "Arc" in "Archery"</a> (basically, projectiles that travel in a straight line).

This leads to the tactic of simply standing to the side of the bridge in the Jungle mission and blowing Xenia to bits without her ever firing a single shot at you.
</li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games, the A.I. is programmed to aim at the center of the player's hitbox. As a result, if you can find a piece of cover where only your head is exposed, you can fire over it with near impunity while the enemies futilely try to shoot your chest and only hit the cover. Exploiting this can make completing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Legendary difficulty</a> much easier. The one limitation is there actually aren't a large amount of pieces of cover which are the exact right height to pull this off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, enemies that only have melee attacks (i.e. zombies or Pinkies) are completely unable to attack you if you jump up on a table or crate, and will run in circles around you rather humorously. The levels are generally designed as a flat plane (other than stairs, which enemies can manage) so you can't do this (most objects are impossible to jump on top of, unlike earlier Id Software games).

<ul><li> In one of the early Elf quests of the Epic Story line, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>, you're charged with rescuing an elf, where you have to carefully navigate through a fortress city, avoiding patrols (which will spawn more mobs) until you reach the ship the elf is held captive on. However, this part can be easily breezed past by simply making a bee-line to the ship, jumping the side rail, and standing behind it. All the mobs that aggroed and spawned will be stuck on the railing, failing to path to the part with no railing, and instead, trying to rush directly at you. At this point, you can just pick each of them off at your leisure with any ranged skill you have - before advancing the quest by talking to the elf.
</li><li> Jousting quests in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>: Wrath of the Lich King</em> can be frustrating because the AI is always faster than you and has a shorter cooldown than you on all the moves. However, after a set period of time they will always, <em>always</em> turn and ride away, giving you ample opportunities to hit them in the back and charge them down.
<ul><li> Also, you can spam the thrust attack to get a melee hit while charging. Best tactic is to hold on strong with thrust spamming, wait until he turns and runs, charge and thrust. While your charge takes you past him and winds down, turn around and spam the spear throw to get in that attack as well and get in close to repeat the cycle. The idea to charging first instead of throwing and then charging is that the latter often gives the AI time to charge before you, while the former denies this. Every cycle, your opponent can lose up to 2 shield charges, costing you a single one at most you can recover immediately.
</li><li> Even easier, you can beat every AI jouster while taking nothing but thrust attacks by abusing their minimum range. Run past them and jump while mouse turning so you're going backwards while facing them, and you can use shield breaker or charge instantly as soon as the abilities light up. The AI will attempt to close to melee and will never use their ranged abilities unless you run too far.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss">Doppleganger</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a> Prophecy</em> copies a player's equipped skills and uses them against you. Players studied its usage of skills and determined it prioritized maintaining buffs, regardless of usefulness, and using skills from left to right on the skill bar. Strategies for defeating it range from front-loading the skill bar with useless buffs that will drain its energy to giving it useless skills with only the right-most being employed by the player. Many classes are able to defeat the Doppleganger with a single skill.
<ul><li> The most widely-available strategy is using the single skill Empathy which causes damage whenever the afflicted attacks. The player need only cast the spell as needed and avoid attacking; the Doppleganger will die faster than its melee can kill the player.
</li></ul></li><li> Bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> run on a script where the boss always attacks in a certain pattern and then changes its pattern when its HP goes below a certain threshold. The changes in the script aren't always instantaneous, so players that can really pump out the damage can cause the boss's HP to drop so quickly that it skips a phase in the script and moves onto the next one. However, this can also royally screw players over if the boss has an attack that can wipe the party or severely cripple them. For example the extreme version of the Leviathan fight has him use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Tidal Wave</a> when his HP gets below a certain amount. Normally, you're supposed to use a machine to create a shield that protects you from the attack. Damaging the boss too fast has him trigger his special attack immediately and will kill everyone.
</li><li> In the online game Dragon Awaken, the Deity Dungeon sets players up against an AI-controlled version of their own team. The AI team eventually has its stats increased by a significant margin over the player's, making them potentially quite powerful and hard-hitting. Because the AI has your character's statistics at a higher level, it will eventually become quite difficult for most players to beat in a straightforward fight. However, there are some simple ways to take advantage of the AI's default behaviour in order to simplify the fight. One of these ways is that, when your character uses the cleric skillset, the AI will follow suit but will typically overlook the cleric's area-of-effect attack in favour of simply healing one person, meaning that even if they could kill your team easily they will have to attack one by one and not on successive turns. This gives you lots of time to defeat the enemy, while in other skillsets they will use an area-of-effect skill to do large amounts of damage quickly. Further, there are some skills that the AI of this dungeon and elsewhere is not programmed to use, called 'talents,' that mean that you can use powerful moves targeting your opponent while they are potentially restricted to healing moves or otherwise. A further consequence of these AI traits appears in places where you can attack players who are represented and defended by an AI version of their team, such as when trying to plunder their land. If the player is using a cleric skillset at the point when you attack, then their AI will also take on the same flaws as the Deity dungeon's AI and become much less damaging, even if the player themselves would be more effective.

<ul><li> There was a hilariously easy way to break the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Beach Fight</a>" mission on New Exford. The premise is that you must take an understrength company of 'Mechs into battle against ten Clan heavy 'Mechs on open terrain, led by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">powerful, tough, and agile</a> Mad Cat Mk II. Going in 8 versus 10 against the superior equipment of the Clans is usually a great way to have a lot of shot up 'Mechs and possibly dead pilots at the end of it all, a fairly punishing price to pay. So...here's the trick. Go alone. The AI for that mission is theoretically following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">rules of war known as zellbrigen</a>, and the commander in her Assault 'Mech normally challenges you and only you, forcing her subordinates to not fight you. However, according to those rules of honor, firing on anyone but the person challenging you is dishonorable and should result in all the Clanners taking shots at you, but in this mission it was coded as "No other Falcons will engage the player until the Falcon commander's 'Mech is destroyed." What this means that you can choose to <em>cripple</em> her 'Mech instead, rendering its weapons useless and unable to damage you, then turn on her allies, walk right up to each of them, and score easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshots</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">shots in the back</a> without them retaliating, even as you destroy them one by one. The trick is surviving a straight fight against the Mad Cat Mk II while crippling but <em>not</em> destroying it—taking her down will cause all the remaining Clanners to dogpile your 'Mech if you're alone, honorable rules of war be damned.

Metal Man will not attack unless Mega Man does (or the player waits a while) and Crash Man will only jump and attack if Mega Man jumps or shoots. Heat Man however, takes the cake. It's possible to force him to do his charging attack if the player times shots correctly, and all the player has to do is jump over him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em>, Toad Man's A.I. is all kinds of broken. First off, he will only use Rain Flush if he's a certain distance away from you; get right up in his face, and he'll try to jump on you. This leaves him open to a Mega Buster to the back, causing him to jump again. Lather, rinse, repeat. Even better, those of you with good timing can stand just far enough away and pelt him with Buster shots in a certain rhythm; time it correctly, and he will stop and restart his Rain Flush animation every time he takes damage, rendering himself <em>completely immobile</em>. (Bright Man has a similar issue, only using Bright Stopper when his health is at certain exact HP levels, which means he won't use them if you Mega Buster him to death or spam pellets at the right thresholds. Bright Man still will shoot at you, so he's not a <em>total</em> pushover.)
</li><li> Also in <em>4</em>, the Cossack Catcher. For some reason, if you <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKjE0_lHqjI">use the slide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=548ox2_DWq8&amp;t=52m43s">Wire Adaptor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3q326');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3q326" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3q326');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lower right portion of the screen, 52:43 in if the video doesn't start there</span> against him, Dr. Cossack stops whatever he was doing for a second or two, then restarts his attack pattern from where he is.

He falls down and doesn't move, you recharge, he gets up, hit him in the face again. Repeat until dead.
</li><li> Blade Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em> is a really annoying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> for those new to the game. He jumps all over the walls and ceiling, giving you little opportunity to attack him, and his signature move is a spread of three painful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">thrown swords</a> <em>aimed at the player</em>. However, if you get familiar with his movement, and know where to stand and move such that his swords will ALWAYS miss, he becomes the most predictable boss of the eight. (Case in point: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/RoahmMythril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/RoahmMythril">Roahm Mythril</a> had serious trouble with Blade Man the first time he faced him in his blind run, but by the time Roahm did MM10 as a "perfect run"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note474vn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note474vn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note474vn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No damage, uncharged buster shots only except where utilities/RM weapons were absolutely necessary</span>, he'd cracked Blade Man's AI wide open to the point that his stage difficulty rating was 1/10, the lowest possible.)
</li><li> Guts Man is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o1RosfnTIk">particularly good at this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em>.
</li><li> Lots of bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X1</a></em> can have their behavior broken by their weaknesses<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5toqm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5toqm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5toqm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Chill Penguin goes up in flames, Spark Mandrill is literally frozen in place, and Sting Chameleon will bounce back and forth between two corners of the ceiling easily reached by X's boomerangs</span>, but Boomer Kuwanger can also be stuck in a loop by an extremely risky dance of death—he'll try to teleport in to bull rush X and slam him into the ceiling, but if you dart out of range while he attempts this, you get a bunch of free shots on him. This is such an effective strategy that most high-level speedrunners choose to tackle his stage second and buster duel him to death. Also, climbing the wall during the first phase of Sigma's fight will always cause him to start wall jumping after you in an easily dodgeable pattern, turning the fight into "Climb wall, wait for him to start wall jumping, then drop down and shoot him, repeat."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3">Mega Man X3</a></em> if you have the air dash and are fighting Blizzard Buffalo, there's a glitch where if you're in the air at a height higher than his height (courtesy of the air dash), then instead of charging across the screen into you, he will charge straight into the wall behind him. Repeated well-timed air dashes straight up will lead to a battle where you can fire off charged shot after charged shot while he does nothing except repeatedly charge into the wall behind him.
</li><li> The tutorial boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> is, oddly enough, the originally very difficult Magma Dragoon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em>. With X and Zero's newfound ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">duck</a>, however, most of his attacks now sail right over the player's head.
</li><li> Rather hilariously, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7">Mega Man X7</a></em> can be defeated with Zero by taking about two steps forward, then two or three steps (depending on camera angle) to the right and then holding down the button that executes Zero's reflective guard move. The boss either misses or hits <em>himself</em> with every attack. The actual position is a little tricky to get into, unfortunately, but once there, you're set.
</li><li> The speedrunner HideOfBeast, who plays the X games under severe constraints<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6qtn7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6qtn7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6qtn7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">X only, no armour or upgrades, no special weapons, <em>no getting hit</em>, sometimes even no dashing!</span>, has had to break several bosses' AI to beat them. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2">Mega Man X2</a></em> boss <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMBrXC1eCY">Bubble Crab<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is easily the one he's embarrassed the most.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero1">Mega Man Zero 1</a></em>, Harpuia will always react to getting hit with a fully charged Ice shot by shooting three easily avoidable wave attacks. By the time he's finished firing all three attacks you'll be fully charged again and can fire another shot, and he'll just respond the exact same way. You can trap him in that pattern until he dies. He gets slightly smarter in the sequel, but not by much. You can still use basically the same strategy.
</li><li> Phoenix Magnion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero2">Mega Man Zero 2</a></em> hovers in place until you try to attack him. If his AI detects input from either attack button while you're near him, he flies or teleports away and counterattacks, which is your window to deal damage. If you hit him hard enough, he cancels the attack and goes back to waiting for you to attack him. Equip the Thunder Chip, Z-Saber, and Shield Boomerang. Charge your saber, tap the Shield button to bait him without triggering his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>, then slap him out of his attack run with the Z-Saber. Repeat until dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity">Rockman 4 Minus Infinity</a></em>, if you attempt to use Rush during the second phase of the battle against Snatchman, Rush will end up assisting your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDoppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDoppelganger">Evil Doppelgänger</a> instead. The only way to stop Rush from doing this is to suck Snatchman up with the Recycle Inhaler, allowing you to finish him off while he's trapped in the can. That is, <em>if</em> you didn't let Snatchman steal the Recycle Inhaler between phases...
</li></ul></li><li> Olmec, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky">Spelunky</a></em>, will quickly stomp in place if the player runs under too soon after he jumps. While this will catch any player too eager to cross to the other side, it does make Olmec dig its grave more quickly. If the position is just right, it also creates a safe zone for the player to repeat the process, as seen in <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/UdIIgQp8cm8?t=3m24s">this speedrun.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The exact same trick returns in the HD remake as well.
</li><li> In the SNES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince Of Persia 1</a></em>, a character backed against a wall no longer has room to recoil from being hit and becomes helpless against non-stop sword strikes. This is exploited very heavily in both regular and tool-assisted speedruns. The six-arm boss avoids this by jumping to another spot on the screen each time it is hit.
<ul><li> Arino in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RetroGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RetroGameMaster">Retro Game Master</a></em> also discovered the same thing by accident when he was playing the game, which made the challenge noticeably easier.
</li></ul></li><li> Using Spider-Man's slide kick attack at just the right distance makes fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Puma</a> in the Game Boy Advance version of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> a breeze, since he just stands in place as you hit him over and over again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, the best way to avoid being hit by the first boss's missiles is to just...stand still. The first salvo will hit the ground far away enough in front of you that you won't be harmed. Once the boss starts moving and repositioning itself, you'd better start running. Presumably, the developers never noticed this because they never thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">any player would be stupid enough to just stand still when the boss is firing at them</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star</a></em> the boss Computer Virus fights like it's in a turn-based game, taking turns to attack you while invulnerable during "his turn", and then sitting there letting you strike it on "your turn." Blocking with the Mirror power or turning into a statue with the Stone power during his turn makes you completely invulnerable.
</li><li> During team battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, flying out of the enemy team's reach makes them spin around in circles without attacking until you land. Since you can fly infinitely as long as you stay in one place, you can safely use Thunder Shoot until the Team Blast meter is full to make the fight much easier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">That is, as long as the enemy team doesn't kill themselves first.</a>

<ul><li> Enemies on the whole don't attack you when they're off-screen, allowing you to render them harmless if you keep the camera rotated away from them while you approach. You can even cancel their attacks by deftly rotating the camera off of them for a moment. Since a lot of enemies are largely immobile and tend to patrol small areas, this is an effective tactic against any enemy that is otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">deadly to engage fairly</a> like the gun-toting dinosaurs of Dino Mines.
</li><li> During the boxing match as Bentley the Yeti in the Frozen Altars level you have a <em>very</em> good chance of winning both times if you just hold right and mash O for quick jabs as fast as you can without letting up. You'll take hits, a lot of hits even, but the opponent usually takes just a wee bit more damage than you. When you're blocking he responds with specific attacks to get around it, but when you're on the offensive he picks his three attacks at random, so if you keep throwing quick jabs you're guaranteed to hit him first any time he goes for a low shot or a wind-up, which is 66% of the time. Given the fight is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">one of the hardest challenges in the game</a> if you attempt to actually fight properly, this is a welcome little abuse of the game's AI.

<ul><li> A common speedrunning tactic in the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon">Panel de Pon</a></em> games is to dump a small garbage block<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7p78p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7p78p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7p78p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Usually accomplished by matching 4, 5, or 6 blocks without chaining them</span> on your CPU opponent followed by a large chain garbage block. The CPU will always prioritize the block closest to the bottom of the well, even if it doesn't make sense for it to do so. If the CPU can't dispose of it, they become paralyzed, even if there's a solution to the garbage block above it. This works even on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> of the games, leading to easy victories if accomplished.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a> 2</em> is <em>about</em> this. Park on a rooftop where the enemies cannot get to you, avoid the occasional missile and wait while the enemies pile up down below and hit each other while fruitlessly spamming their weapons. The only level that <em>cannot</em> be beaten this way is (for this reason) by far the hardest. But it is fair: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">the A.I. is a cheating bastard</a> and if you attempt to fight honestly, you'll get blasted with an endless chain of freeze missiles with no hope for escape or get 20 special weapons in your face.
<ul><li> While the final boss cannot be beaten this way, he fails at another cheap trick you can exploit for all it's worth: land mines. Just drive around the city, dropping long rows of mines. Eventually he WILL roll over them, taking tiny amounts of his enormous life bar until you can finish him off in a regular shot or two (or just finish him with mines, really).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSKa_q_2XXA">Why use mines when you can simply play hide and seek in one of the buildings?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> Playing on the X Cup in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero X</a></em> is bound to hit this trope at some point. Because the tracks in the X Cup have randomized designs, it's possible to have tracks where the AI cannot handle the weird dips and curves, causing them to fling themselves off the track. It is entirely possible for the X Cup to generate a track where all 29 AI opponents kill themselves with no effort on your part.
</li><li> Cops in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driver">Driver</a></em> are often faster than you and incredibly persistent, but handle their cars horribly, to the point that simple slaloming between cars and other obstacles are often all you need to get them to crash.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart">Super Mario Kart</a></em>, the computer will always jump over a banana peel on the track if it could reasonably see it coming on higher difficulties. On tracks where you need to hit a jump panel to proceed (which is how this game handled "figure 8" sections), placing a banana right where the computer would drive would cause all of them to miss the jump and be stuck, giving the player a clean victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em> has the 200cc engine class, which is an extremely fast speed compared to the then fastest 150cc class. 200cc has the speed cranked so high that the AI can barely handle it. Depending on the track played, you can see the AI smash into the walls or go flying off the track and into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>. The clearest case of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblyClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblyClouds">Cloudtop Cruise</a>, which has a shortcut near the end involving driving off the track and landing on a series of small platforms. The AI is programmed to attempt this shortcut, and almost every single time, it will overshoot the platforms and fall off every lap, making it one of the easiest tracks to place 1st in 200cc (provided you've accustomed yourself to the track).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetPassMiiPlaza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetPassMiiPlaza">StreetPass Mii Plaza</a></em>'s <em>Slot Car Rivals</em>, the computer players have problems with jumps that require boost pads, namely recovery after landing. The idea is to let go of the accelerator right before the end of the jump, which will provide the boosts needed to cross the gaps. However, the AI will not restart the accelerator until long after it has landed, causing the AI's cars to decelerate to an unnecessary degree. This makes racetracks with many such jumps, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Soaring Skyway</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmtreePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PalmtreePanic">Start 'n' Stop Island</a>, pathetically easy to beat the AI on by huge margins. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, Iceman, takes jumps like this, and is the key to outdoing him as he will play near-perfectly otherwise.
</li><li> When playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em>, take note of the line that goes down the middle of the track in Papu's Pyramid. When you race him as a boss he will without fail drive down the dead center of that line, meaning he'll hit everything you leave on it guaranteed. If you get ahead of him early on, it's rather easy to win his race with a lead of <em>half a minute</em> by abusing this.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechCommander">MechCommander</a></em> games had absolutely <em>abysmal</em> AI; they would make use of the game's built-in pathfinding and range-keeping routines to have their units walk towards their targets and maintain their optimal weapons range to attack, but the AI's so-called decision making process could be entirely summed up by 'issue a single attack command on the first thing you see'. Notably, the AI was completely incapable of telling its units to <em>change</em> targets, even if its target was no longer accessible. This meant that you could destroy an unlimited number of AI units with minimal risk by simply getting their attention with a fast 'mech and luring them past the rest of your force. This would result in the AI 'mechs obliviously plodding through a lethal gauntlet of your heavy and assault 'mechs and getting shot to bits without ever returning fire as they obsessively continued to try to catch up with the harmless light 'mech on the other side of the map. Due to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">'stat inflation'</a> style of difficulty, exploiting this quirk was almost mandatory for completing the game on harder difficulty settings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIWarFleetCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIWarFleetCommand">AI War: Fleet Command</a></em> has this as its whole point: Attacking the AI planet-by-planet is a certain way to lose the game. The AI doesn't get units depending on how much territory it controls and can draw ressources from, but depending on how much of a threat you appear to be. Should you for some reason manage to destroy every command command station but the final, game-winning one, you will now face fleets bigger than ever. The solution? Harm the AI as little as possible while still making progress - conquer only those planets where you can obtain something valuable, cripple the threatening ones and ignore the rest so your threat rating doesn't go up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a></em>'s skirmish mode, the AI never uses the low-level but powerful Teleport spell, giving human players an enormous advantage.

<ul><li> Alternatively, you can run a cavalry unit into the town square, cause the enemy to chase after you, then leave the square. Repeat this until the enemy can barely walk before a full frontal onslaught. This actually works in any offensive battle where you out-power your opponent.

As soon as you get besieged (before they can build battering rams), sally out to meet them. Then, go out the gate opposite the army (you have a gate on each side of the town, N/S/E/W). The army will see that there is an open gate and run around the city, right by the towers. Then, go back inside. As soon as the gate closes and there is no units targetable, the army will stop where they are, regardless of whether or not they are being shot at by the towers. As only siege can target towers, they do not respond. Crank up time and watch their best units die one by one. After 15 minutes or so, the battle will end. Continue until their army is literally dead through stupidity.
</li><li> If you attack an enemy army and then walk your archers a short distance ahead of your infantry, the enemy will send a few troops - cavalry if they have them, infantry if they don't - to attack your 'defenseless' archers while the rest of their infantry force holds back. If you wait until their infantry are almost to your archers, you can then pull back your archers, massacre their tiny infantry detachment, back off and repeat until their entire army is dead or the AI generals decides that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">Know When to Fold 'Em</a> and run away.
</li></ul></li><li> Attempting to convert a unit with two priests at once in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI">Age of Empires</a></em> would leave it unable to decide which to attack, resulting in the unit standing still until converted.
<ul><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII">Age of Empires II</a></em>, the AI was programmed to attack walls but not gates, so making your wall entirely out of gates would make it basically indestructible.
<ul><li> Another tactic to exploit this is build one of your gates directly in front of the enemies' gates, keeping them locked in their own city till your forces are ready to overwhelm them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em>:
<ul><li> One way to stall a Titan-level enemy was to build lots and lots of little wall pieces near their base. The AI soldiers see them and think "Enemy structure. Must destroy." and they do just that, giving you extra time to build an army or team up with other players.
</li><li> Another wall example: the A.I. can be herded into ambushes consisting of your entire army. Repeatedly. See, if you build a wall all the way around your base, the A.I. will choose what it believes to be the weakest point and attack. However, it is also programmed to seek out gaps in the wall. Therefore, the best way to secure your base is to make a wall that goes <em>almost</em> all the way around it, and then simply park your army in the gap. As long as they can get there, the enemy will always beeline for that one spot.
</li><li> Another variation of the above strategy is to surround one's base with walls but with a single gap, as above, then build further layers of walls around that, such that the enemy must navigate even further to get at your buildings, passing through narrow corridors of walls along the way. Line the interior of those walls with arrow towers, and the enemy will get strung out and shot to pieces as they try to run the gauntlet. Suddenly your base has turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Tower Defense</a> level!
</li><li> Not to mention the fact that you can simply use the Titans' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">slow</a> walk speed against them; simply cause them to aggro a slightly faster unit (an <a class="urllink" href="http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/atlanteans/units/units/argus.htm">Argus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is basically a sentient blob, is fast enough) and lead them in circles until you get your archers/whatever to finish the Titan off.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII">Age of Empires III</a></em>, ranged attackers would usually go for the walls, and keep attacking them until they were all destroyed. Simply building a long, winding wall away from the camp could keep them busy until they could be destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a well-known example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em>: if you wall off a chokepoint with buildings that don't attack (generally Terran supply depots) and then put ranged attackers behind those buildings, the AI's Zerglings or Zealots will run around in front of the buildings looking for a nonexistent path while you shoot them to ribbons.
<ul><li> Another with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Carriers</a>: they have no attack of their own, but rather attack with swarms of mini-units they themselves build. These units, called Interceptors, are targetable and indeed destroyable - and the AI will usually prioritize them rather than the Carrier itself. They're also cheap as chips and speedily rebuilt, so Carriers can easily wreak havoc on enemy bases without incurring much damage. Notably this is a tactic doomed to fail against human opponents, who'll ignore the Interceptors entirely and focus all available firepower on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">Mook Maker</a>, whose death will also eliminate its sub-units from the fight - but the automated defenses still follow AI rules, so Carriers remain useful against turtling players.
</li><li> There are two examples of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>.
<ul><li> First is that the AI will ALWAYS have an attack around 6 minutes. If you build up enough to defeat that early attack, you can simply macro up to take their base when their second (much smaller) attack comes.)
</li><li> Secondly, the AI's response to a rush (very early offensive tactics) can be sub-par which allows you to always win if you use those tactics. It used to be that the AI could <em>never</em> handle these extremely early attacks, but in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a>, newer versions of the game AI can recognize <em>and stop</em> some forms of early aggression using the same methods a human would (catching you in the act, then attacking with Worker Units).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The campaign missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Warcraft II</a></em> can often be dealt with by throwing your starting forces into suicide runs on the computer's transports (which the computer rarely if ever rebuilds) and/or town hall, buying all the time you need. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypasses</a> and the computer's inability to marshal distant forces when under attack help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>: In skirmish games with a random hero enabled, the AI will react to an enemy hero attacking by sending their own hero. However, if severely damaged the hero will run away, either until you stop chasing or into a group of creeps, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">denying you the experience when it dies</a>, and leaving their base crippled. They also have great difficulty dealing with focus-firing on heroes or hit-and-run by air units.
<ul><li> The AI often has problems if it didn't start with the right hero, often doing nothing until it get to tier 2 and the desired hero. By end game (if they survived that long) they are then stuck with two useable heroes and a weak one in their base, while the others are running around with three high-level heroes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold">Stronghold</a></em> was plagued with an AI that would always send its melee troops to the nearest gap in the fortress walls instead of attacking the nearest or weakest wall. This allowed the user to set up elaborate death traps of burning pitch fields and endless rows of archers to decimate the incoming hordes as they marched mindlessly toward the 'weak spot', or even better mazes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn</a></em> is full of these.
<ul><li> Attacking an enemy harvester would always make the AI empty its base to defend the harvester with everything it had.
<ul><li> Enemy harvesters would also try to run over attacking Recon Bikes, which they had no hope of catching. This means a Nod player could ride a single Bike to a couple of enemy harvesters, fire a shot at each, and then lure the harvesters back to his base defenses.
</li></ul></li><li> Building a wall of sandbags or other barriers allowed the player to completely trap the AI in its base. It never intentionally tries to destroy them.
</li><li> The AI would rebuild its bases according to the predetermined layouts if any of it was destroyed, and it would ALWAYS replace lost buildings if it had the financial capability to do so, allowing the player to drain their funds easily if a vulnerable building could be found to continuously wail on (and the AI would always spend money to repair damaged buildings). The final mission of the GDI campaign actually seems to be designed to allow the player to exploit this; a large group of Nod <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">tiberium</a> silos is concentrated outside of the main base, allowing the player to continuously capture them (stealing the money inside), sell the silos and transfer the stored tiberium to their own storage facilities, and then the AI would rebuild them and fill them up to be captured again. On the flip side, another GDI final mission has the AI suddenly start building near a tiberium field, making the AI rather dangerous.
</li><li> Combine the last two by building a sandbag where an A.I. building was destroyed and the A.I. will never rebuild that building.
</li><li> The AI scanned for targets starting from the top left of the screen, possibly assuming that was where your construction yard was. This meant that you could defend against airstrikes by putting a minigunner northwest of your base. This was much more cost-effective than building multiple SAM sites to destroy the planes, which had no rebuild cost. It also meant that you could potentially stop your base from ever being attacked, simply by diverting the AI away from it.
</li><li> Similarly, with Engineers the AI always tried to take over your Tiberium silos. Even if it has to walk past your Construction Yard or other valuable buildings, not to mention other units eager to shoot them, to get there. When you don't have silos, it may send Engineers into defense structures, which can't be taken over. (You as the player cannot give such an order; when the computer does it, the engineers just disappear into the building which remains unaffected.)
</li><li> The 'wall trick' exploits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> incapability to directly attack walls. It involves building a sandbag wall across the map to the enemy base, then sealing them inside with concrete walls. Any wall will work for sealing them in, but Concrete walls work best as collateral damage is possible with certain units.
</li></ul></li><li> The AI in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a></em> will always (and we mean always) fire their once-per-ten-minutes superweapon at the most expensive cluster of your units and buildings possible. Usually this means your War Factory, source of your main assault forces. But the Naval units you can build rack up the expenses pretty quickly as well, and superweapons do next to nothing to Naval production facilities. Cluster a bunch of Subs/Destroyers/Aircraft Carriers/Dreadnoughts around your Naval Yard, then have them scurry off when the Superweapon alarm goes off. The Superweapon lightly grazes the naval pen, and you lose nothing.
<ul><li> The AI also targets whichever War Factory is set as your primary building (where the units come out). So you can build one away from your base and set it as the primary just before the AI fires the superweapon, drawing the fire.
</li><li> On campaign missions, the AI also build along a fixed base layout plan. Block the predefined location with a unit/building and the AI won't rebuild what was originally there. Also, AI units appear to be permanently stuck in Guard mode, meaning that they are very susceptible to luring via shooting them with artillery then retreating behind a wall of tanks. The AI will mindlessly charge the wall and get slaughtered.
</li><li> In the very first mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</a>: Uprising</em> you need to get a large group of infantry past several of the expansion's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> units. The enemy fields artillery units that can transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomePersonnelCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomePersonnelCarrier">Awesome Personnel Carrier</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">anti-infantry Gatling gun</a>. In your force, you have units that can disable vehicles, but a single enemy unit can kill most of them with its close-range APC weapon. Try to just run a crowd past the enemy, and they'll massacre them with artillery fire. Winning the mission honestly is almost impossible. Alternatively, you can order a single soldier to run in a circle just within artillery range. The enemy tank will keep firing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure">missing him</a> and will not start to transform into an APC until you fire at it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">With your entire infantry force positioned point-blank around it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth">Empire Earth</a></em> has one where AI units attack whoever attacked them with all priority, even if that means getting past the wall of other units in their way. In the Greek campaign it is possible to win Alexander's battles by having a single archer move up, fire once at an enemy, and run like hell. The entire enemy army will follow and get shredded by the rest of your units, inflicting no casualties on your side (unless you let your archer get killed, then they attack anything in range).
<ul><li> Additionally, the best defence in the game is having two spaced-apart layers of walls. The AI is designed to make a hole in your wall and then flood through the gap. However if they break through the first wall layer only to find more walls, the invading army will simply go home. Since the maps are so big and replacing that single destroyed wall segment takes only 15 seconds, this exploit can buy the player as much time as they need to build up forces.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em>, the Computer's Keepers would drop their entire army on an intruder that is seen on their territory, while you can only pick up 8 creatures at a time. You can turn this against them later in the game when you get the spell Destroy Wall. All you have to do is find the enemy portal (which you already see at the start), and destroy some of the walls around it, leaving bare earth. Drop an imp on it, and you can see into the enemy base (at which point you can cast lightning, picking off the enemies one by one). The AI breaker comes when the enemy spots the imp next to the portal, and drops its army on the portal because it is next to the imp, at which point you pick up the imp. A good number of them will walk into the portal, as dropping a creature on the portal dismisses it. Repeat this a few times, and the Keeper will have removed most of its strongest creatures without spilling a drop of blood. It's best to do this on a level where gems are available, as this can be costly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BattleZone1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BattleZone1998">BattleZone II</a></em>, the International Space Defense Force is totally incapable of handling a player whose tank is equipped with the Sonic Wave cannon, a weapon which will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">make any projectile-based weapon harmlessly reflect away</a> from your tank; the ISDF uses projectile-based weapons by default on almost <em>every</em> combat unit save for the Atilla LM (a very late-game unit) and the Thunderbolt scout, rendering basically every unit belonging to the ISDF AI completely pointless. The weapon is less of an AI breaker for the Scions, who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">hitscan</a> weapons on their defense towers, and upgrade their primary tanks to fire hitscan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun">lightning bolts</a>. Thankfully, it's impossible to used massed Sonic Wave equipped ships, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">tank AI is incapable of using the weapon properly</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you're playing as a faction that can send a long stream of units into an enemy's base (Ork Slugga Boys, Tau Harbinger Drones), the AI will attack them first, letting your army shoot them at range. Particularly hilarious when fighting Space Marines, as they'll often fire an Orbital Bombardment <em>inside their own base</em>.
</li><li> In the <em>Dark Crusade</em> campaign, enemies attacking a sufficiently fortified defended area you control will get sidetracked by destroying the Listening Post just outside their base and ignore the two automatically unclaimed Strategic Points right inside it.
</li><li> In the sequels, Cyrus is the best character to use against bosses. Simply give him all the explosives he can use, stealth him, and park your other squads with lange bombardments at maximum range. The boss will just sit there without trying to detect or counterattack and take every shot, missile and grenade to the face until you move in your melee squads for the kill.
</li><li> AI units will always run away from a demo charge before it can explode. However, they always run directly away from it, allowing you to herd them into a remote charge (even more damaging, and invisible) or into range of your other units, or simply get them to stop shooting you for a few seconds.

The AI will ignore the warning and dilly-dally, try to move out of the way at the last second, and get hit because the laser is too wide for them to move far away enough before it hits.
</li><li> Most of Aya's attacks, in normal gameplay, can be easily avoided by simple bullet streaming. The AI, however, doesn't bother with such tactics, and promptly takes a shot to the face due to its poor handling of fast-moving bullets.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em>:
<ul><li> The SNES games had this problem: it is possible to use the same play for an entire season and the computer opponent could never figure out how to stop you.
</li><li> Quite a few offensive plays can be used infinitely and the AI will never catch on. Exactly which plays vary from year to year as the AI is tweaked, but there has yet to be an iteration of the game which doesn't include at least a few of these. For example, you can set "Hot Routes" for individual receivers before the play starts. Set your Tight End to run an "Out" or "Slant" pattern, and throw just after he cuts on the Out route or right after your Quarterback's dropback animation on the Slant. He'll be between the Outside Linebacker and the Cornerback and uncovered by either 9 out of 10 times, even on All-Madden difficulty.
</li><li> For several iterations in the mid-2000s, it was possible to take manual control of defensive linemen before the snap and align them in ways which break the offense's blocking AI, creating unstoppable blitzes. <em>Madden 08</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> this by moving these players back to their original position once you switch manual control.
</li><li> <em>Madden 18</em> took this to the next level with the Gun Monster playbook. This set of plays involves lining up only three offensive linemen in the center with the tackles lined up next to the wide receivers. The problem? The AI responds to this play by spreading out its front seven to cover the groups of three, resulting in an easy run up the middle every single time. (In real life, as the tackles aren't eligible receivers, the defense won't bother to cover them.) EA eventually nerfed this playbook in response.
</li><li> AI players set their contract demands based on their Overall rating. One common trick is to forcibly change their position to one they are terribly ill-suited for (WR -&gt; DT, for example), so that their Overall rating takes a massive hit. Then re-sign them for peanuts and switch them back. You could even do this to opposing teams' players and get them to trade away their stars.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>NCAA 2011</em>, pump-faking backwards causes <strong>all</strong> the defenders to abandon their assignments and rush the QB, leaving your receivers completely uncovered downfield.
</li><li> In <em>Major League Baseball</em> for the NES, throwing a slow pitch would make the computer batter move toward the front of the batter's box. It was possible to throw a slow curve ball to the left that did not cross the front of the plate (so the computer batter wouldn't swing) but did catch the back of it (so it would be called a strike). Using this one pitch repeatedly, it's possible to pitch a perfect game of 81 consecutive strikes.
<ul><li> Nearly any baseball game that allows the player to control the pitch at all in mid-air can utilize the same trick: At some point during the pitch, have the ball curve away from the hitter (the timing is different in each game and depending on the pitcher's abilities, of course). If the timing is right the AI batter will swing even though the ball has gone out of hitting range, causing a strike. Get really good at this and you can pitch a perfect game with ease.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>NHL Stanley Cup</em> for the Super Nintendo had a flaw where performing a full-power slapshot from one of the lines would cause the puck to fly over the opponent goalie's head directly into the goal, as being that far out made the goalie pull out.
</li><li> Up until <em>NHL 2001</em>, the goalie AI was so slow at poke checking, skating in front of the goalie would cause it to attempt a poke check with the player free to shoot on an empty net.
</li><li> Nintendo's <em>Ice Hockey</em> had a bug in which if you skated straight at your opponent's net, just below the middle of the rink, and held the "shoot" within a certain range, the goalie would move out of the way, letting you make an easy shot.
</li><li> In <em>Blades Of Steel</em>, you couldn't aim your shot; an arrow would move back and forth across the goal to show where your shot would go, and the goalie was very good at standing in front of it. You could, however, skate directly at the goal and <em>pass</em> the puck into the net without any reaction from the goalie at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer">FIFA Soccer</a> 2003</em> the opposing goalkeeper had a habit of rushing out to the edge of his box when a free kick was rolled for a second player to take a shot. Free kicks in central positions, no matter the distance from goal, could therefore lead to certain goals for players with high enough long shooting stats.
<ul><li> The original <em>FIFA International Soccer</em> had a notorious AI exploit: stand in front of the opposing goalkeeper when he's about to take a goal kick, and he'll blindly kick it straight to you, allowing you to run past him and score.

<ul><li> Vulcan Raven sometimes fails to notice that he's knocked over one of the crates, but the collision detection keeps track. You can lure him into shooting one down, and then watch him walk into it repeatedly until he's provided with some other stimulus, like seeing you. If you hide in the corner, you can flatten him with Nikita missiles without him moving from his spot. He also has a slight overlap in his cone of vision and his minigun's hit radius, meaning that he can theoretically be whaling on a wall while you stand behind a wall and Nikita spam.
</li><li> During the second phase of the Hind D fight (after the first major air strike) standing underneath the Hind will cause Liquid to be unable to see you, and you can spam Stingers underneath him while he strafes back and forth looking for you.
</li><li> Guards will have a temporary moment of blindness after finishing their search of a suspicious noise, allowing you to take them out early.
</li><li> It's possible, with very precise timing, to interrupt Ocelot's initial attack animation so that he enters a state where every single shot of his will miss as long as you keep firing at him.
</li><li> During the second Sniper Wolf battle you can use Nikita missiles instead of the PSG1, and Wolf is <em>only</em> programmed to react to the rifle. She won't attempt to dodge, hide from, or even shoot the slowly approaching missiles, turning what is normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>.

However, if you press yourself up against the object, the AI will think you're trying to move in that direction, and the missiles will always come in too low to hit you. May be the only way to beat it on Extreme.

<ul><li> It also has one that can specifically be used to get an achievement. There's an achievement for staying in combat for 10 minutes. You can get the guards near vigilantes, and the guards will just keep running into the vigilantes without knocking them down, going around, etc.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">sequel</a>, if you jump on a beam about 3 meters above the ground and your legs are pulled up, enemies can't reach you with their weapons, so they switch to throwing stones. As they do, they holster their weapons. Then you can assassinate one or two of them and jump up again and repeat. Amazingly effective.

Take a look at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brains_in_Bahrain">the Brains in Bahrain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for an example of anti-computer play. Simpler chess programs usually have more easily exploitable weaknesses.
<ul><li> At the very least, you want to take trades early and often unless there's an obvious reason not to. This is less about the computer's weaknesses and more about your own as accelerating the game prevents you from getting tired and impatient against an opponent with infinite stamina and patience.
</li><li> Chess masters could beat chess playing programs by selecting suboptimal moves, which would often confuse the computer which was predicting a different course of action. However, as programming improved, this flaw has been completely removed.

<ul><li> We can do you one better: The enemy A.I will also do similar moves if it's above the seven card limit. And there are a few decks that can eliminate enemy lands with ease. Therefore, mana lock him, and he will be enchanting your creatures with Holy Strength in no time.
</li><li> Also, while no pre-built deck combines Spellbook (no hand size limit) with Ivory Tower (Gain life every turn equal to the cards in hand minus four), should YOU make one and the computer gets both those cards on the field, he will proceed to play NOTHING.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a card in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dominion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dominion">Dominion</a></em> called Rats, which trashes a card in your hand and replaces it with another copy of Rats. In the Android version, something about this card breaks the AI players' valuation algorithms, and they'll happily play Rats every time they can, until they've trashed their entire deck and have nothing left but a bunch of Rats. The smarter AI players just don't buy the card in the first place, but if you can give them a copy with a card like Masquerade, they'll do the exact same thing.

Octolings do not seem to be programmed to deal with Autobombs, shooting at it while standing still until the Autobomb walks right up to them and detonates for an instant knockout. Sometimes, an Octoling will instead react by hiding in her ink and not move, unaware that Autobombs can detect them even while hiding.
<ul><li> During the "Rush" event in Salmon Run, Chum and Goldies will dash, single-file, to whichever Inkling has the Glowflies around his or her head. If one of the players has a Roller (not including brushes), that player can lower the Roller down in front of the Salmonids, and they will all crash into the Roller and splat themselves. Each stage has a single elevated "dead end" that offers only one or two entries for the frenzied Chum, so a savvy Roller or Brella player can set up shop at the entrance while his better-ranged buddies can soften up the Goldies while the whole horde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">leeroy</a> themselves into extinction.

You still must provide a path for them to get through, otherwise they just run through your towers. However, if you constantly change the path, by purchasing and destroying towers, you can keep the flow of enemies in a single area, thus giving your towers plenty of time to kill them off.

<ul><li> Many levels in the GBA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em> can be taken out simply by relying on the AI's <em>loathing</em> of resupply trucks. You can sneak a <em>lot</em> of units through enemy-occupied territory just by distracting the computer with them.
<ul><li> The AI also has a severe loathing of infantry in the process of capturing a building, even if the infantry in question has 2 HP and will need something like 10 turns to capture. It's always good to have some infantry to <strike>sacrifice</strike> reinforce your tanks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">CO Powers</a> that auto-target a particular clump of units can be beaten with expensive bait. Take the final mission of <em>AW2</em>. Sturm would throw his meteor after the expensive clump of bombers in the lower corner instead of the cheap tanks assaulting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> at the top of the map. And considering how the meteor can only damage, but not destroy, units effectively renders the ability ineffective.
</li><li> In Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, the AI knows that infantry are important. So much so that if it has fewer than 3 infantry, it will always build more, regardless of its wealth or needs. Getting out some AA guns and slaughtering infantry every turn makes levels trivial, as the computer won't ever build tanks to oppose you.
</li><li> Two-Week Test in II tasks you with holding off the enemy for 14 days. If you don't build any units your enemy will have no clue what to do and will just stupidly charge forward until they've lumped all over your properties. Since the faster non-infantry units get there first the AI will block it's own infantry from being able to capture your HQ, and with no units to destroy they can't win by obliterating your troops. You win by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">doing absolutely nothing</a></em>.
</li><li> The AI also appears to follow a hard-coded logic table with little to no flexibility. It will always react the same way to a given play-style. This is why those turn-by-turn walkthroughs on GameFAQs actually <em>work</em> if you follow the steps to a T!
</li><li> The final battle against Sturm in the original <em>Advance Wars</em> is actually made easier by allowing Sturm to capture the airport near Andy's starting point. Since Sturm is guaranteed to use that airport to churn out expensive fighters and bombers every round, you can cripple his income by camping out with some missile batteries and shooting down these aircraft as soon as they spawn, slowing down his seemingly inexhaustible frontline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> enough to make breaking through to his base significantly easier.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> V</em>
<ul><li> The AI has no idea how to play as the Venice civ. Since the AI leans heavily towards making many small cities instead of a few big ones, playing as a faction that can't build or capture new cities except for using a very limited supply of Great People to puppeteer city-states and then fails to realize its number one priority must be gold generation leaves it absolutely crippled.
</li><li> Venice is one of the best civs <em>against</em> the AI as well. The reasoning is similar; they don't see your gold generation and great people as a big threat, and are happy with you for not taking too much land. Once Venice gets going, it starts snowballing its gold and puppets into a powerful force, at which point the AI couldn't stop them if they tried.
</li><li> Archipelago and other maps with a lot of small land masses. The AI isn't great at naval management, especially in the earlier versions of the game, so an intercontinental invasion is less likely to succeed, even against other AI. Even better, these maps are the best ones for Venice to play on.
</li><li> In general, the AI does not know how to manage a field army well unless those units are very mobile like mounted units, planes, or ships. Typical artillery, infantry, etc. are sent across the field without a particular order, allowing defensive players to maximize opportunities to use ranged attacks on approaching units with limited fear of retaliation. The AI will also tend to use a lot more melee units than a human would, and unless the AI army has a significant numerical or technological advantage, this mostly lets the army get torn to bits by ranged units and city defenses. The first time in the game you try attacking a city at full health with a melee unit, you'll receive helpful advice that doing so is a bad idea. The AI apparently did not receive that memo.
</li><li> When declaring war, the AI doesn't seem to take into consideration the distance it has to travel through your borders, the terrain that's there, how fast you can bring units to the front line, how fast you generate production or gold to obtain more units, etc. So, it's not unusual to see an enemy army spill over your borders 4-5 hexes away from your city and get bogged down by forests and hills while you quickly bring other units to the cities aid via roads and railroads.
</li></ul></li><li> The Australia civ in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> VI</em> doubles down on the AI's inability to properly gauge production capacity. The AI will repeatedly start wars because it sees an enemy with small military, never mind that Australia has <em>doubled</em> production for 10 turns up receiving a declaration of war and will have a fresh-built defense force in place by the time the enemy gets there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has a few of these, but they're rare or situational enough that it's generally easier to either get better at the game, or level grind. However, players engaging in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">challenge runs</a> need every advantage they can get, and there are a number of well known tricks for various bosses.
<ul><li> The most notable of such tricks is known as the Loss Strategy. Loss is an ability possessed by numerous bosses (in particular, the hardest ones) that can inflict the confusion status with 100% success rate. A confused unit will run around the battle field using random abilities at random targets. The AI is hard-wired to never break confusion unless it knows it can kill the target in two hits. Normally, this is not a problem, but in a solo challenge, when the player is confused and the boss cannot kill him quickly, the boss either does nothing, or uses mostly harmless spells that can't actually kill the player. With no allies to attack the confused character can only attack the boss. This means that many otherwise strategy intensive boss fights end up reduced to 'get confused with enough HP, enjoy a drink while the random AI slowly kills the boss'.
</li><li> The AI is similarly set to ignore characters who have Death Sentence, since they'll die in 3 turns anyway. However, you can wear equipment or accessories that block the Death status that is applied to your unit at the end of that third turn. So give yourself Death Sentence and enjoy three turns worth of free hits.
</li><li> The AI will not use attacks with elemental damage if you are wearing equipment or accessories that absorb or make you immune to said element. While this works for normal things (like shutting down Dragons, or having all physical melee units in Lionel Castle ignore you because they've got Lightning weapons and you can buy Rubber Shoes), in the original PSX version this also works against Wiegraf because the game mistakenly thinks his skills are Holy elemental; as soon as stores have Chameleon Robes are in stock and you're in a class that can wear robes, Wiegraf will never use any of his devastating sword skills on you.
</li><li> In the battle against the assassins, they always try to kill the character with the lower HP value, which is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Rafa, who loves charging head-on into battle</a> (and if Rafa dies it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>). A player aware of this could simply get a naked unit into the battle so it would have less HP than Rafa and the assassins would go for this unit, leaving Rafa alone.
</li></ul></li><li> In several of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games, the enemy AI will always target a unit who cannot counterattack if possible, even if the attack is guaranteed to miss or deal zero damage. This can easily be used to bait enemies into wasting their turns and powerful weapons on an unarmed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">General</a> over a healer that could easily be killed in two attacks.
<ul><li> Although pretty risky to exploit, the one overriding rule of Fire Emblem AI is that, regardless of any other factor, if it is mathematically possible to kill a unit in exactly one round of combat, the AI will always attack them. If the wounded unit has a skill that lets them counterattack before being hit, and Wrath, which greatly boosts their odds of getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> when below a certain health threshold, it is possible for them to instantly kill a full-health attacker before said attacker actually gets the chance to attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, the Summoner class is a particularly good abuser of this: they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinionMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinionMaster">summon phantoms</a> that invariably have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">only one hit point</a>. This means that as long as a phantom is within range of the AI, it will drop anything it's doing and mercilessly focus on knocking out the phantom's last hit point. What's more, one of the most dangerous lategame enemies is the Gorgon, which can use the long-range Shadowshot spell to focus-fire on your units and kill them in two or three hits—but as long as a phantom is within their range, the Gorgon is effectively neutralized.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dread Lords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations">Galactic Civilizations</a></em> are immensely overpowered, but can easily be lead around by the nose by exploiting their aggressiveness. They will rarely stop chasing an enemy ship once they've seen it, which means a sufficiently fast ship can lead them on a merry chase all over the galaxy (though, the Dread Lords are pretty fast themselves, so this is only possible at higher tech levels). They also go out of their way to attack starbases, <em>anywhere</em>, so building a starbase all the way across the map from them is a great way to distract a large portion of their fleet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> II</em>, the AI ALWAYS attacks the strongest ranged units first. While most ranged units are rather fleshy, thus making this a good tactic, if you have two titans and five hundred magi, the magi are massively outdamaging the titans, yet the AI will still waste their attacks on the titan's massive HP. Add in the weak but plentiful halflings (whose low hit points don't matter anymore) and the Wizard troops can defeat most AI with little effort.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> III</em>, the AI is fairly good at avoiding terrain and traps if they can see them, unless they happen to be between their units and your own. Much like in <em>Heroes II</em>, AI creatures will always move to attack yours if they're in range, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">even if there's a magical wall of fire in the way</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> IV</em>:
<ul><li> During a siege, a defending AI would never send its melee units out to attack your troops unless you had knocked down the castle gate, making winning such sieges a trivially easy task of "shoot the shooters first".
</li><li> And even if you can't win the siege, hiding your army in a nearby sawmill or ore mine will lure the defenders out of the castle.
</li><li> Melee units will always prioritize attacking the units they can reach their turn over moving towards more distant targets, which allows you to repeatedly send in summoned creatures to stall the AI troops, or a griffin buffed with First Strike to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> them with its counterattacks.

<ul><li> It also can't handle deflectors or disruptors, forward-only shields that are completely impervious to projectiles or energy weapons. Just make sure the appropriately equipped ship is in the front and the enemy will happily waste time shooting at the shield instead of trying to get around it. This is particularly effective against the Liir and Morrigi AI, which have a strong preference to only using energy weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> Units in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane">Warlock Master Of The Arcane</a></em> have different defensive bonuses against different damage types. Ghost units are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">completely immune to melee-, ranged-, and death-type damage</a>. This won't stop the AI from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">attacking ghosts with units that don't deal any other type of damage</a>, committing suicide-by-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter-Attack</a> in case of melee-units.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest">Pokémon Conquest</a></em>, the AI has no idea how to handle the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrictionlessIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrictionlessIce">Frictionless Ice</a> at Nixtorm, and will try to avoid crossing it at all unless they have an Ice or Flying type Pokémon on their team. If you can manoeuvre something into position to bombard them from a distance, they won't try and stop you.
</li><li> Due to a programming oversight, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> didn't have an AI routine to deal with unconscious units, likely because the players is unable to cause unconsciousness on enemies under usual circumstances. However, if you managed to knock an enemy unit unconscious using a mind controlled Stun Lancer or a Berserker, the AI would get stuck in a loop until the game forcefully ended their turn after a short while. This was later patched out.

As they can't use Levitation themselves, they'll just stand there while you pick them off with ranged attacks. At best, they might run back and forth, making them slightly harder to hit.
</li><li> Levitation can also be used <em>offensively</em>. Casting it on a NPC will cause that character to remain perfectly still for the duration of the spell, allowing you to kill them easily. This works because the AI isn't programmed to handle levitating, so it is treated like a high-powered Burden spell instead. This works especially well on flying enemies, such as everyone's favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodDamnedBats">Cliff Racers</a>, as they will fall to the ground and take fall damage.

You never, ever get attacked unless there is a script, as long as all the armor is on, and even enemies that are scripted to attack you won't see you. You can run around, smack guards and steal all day long and aside from the guard talking to you, they won't even see it. You can just run up, punch a guard in the face, and he will do the whole "you broke the law" talk, and if you resist he pulls out his sword and says "Where did he go!?" It makes for some quite funny gameplay.

It is possible to place a bucket over an NPC's head and then steal every item you can carry while they go about their business without realizing that anything's amiss. Bethesda made it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">Ascended Glitch</a> by not patching it out, since players who don't want to abuse it can just ignore it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, most enemies will tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman">Gang Up on the Human</a> and give very low priority to NPC squadmates, allowing the player to take cover and draw fire while their allies kill the enemies. In fact some enemies like the Praetorians <em>never shoot at allies at all</em>. Perhaps justified, as Harbinger is specifically trying to kill Shepard.
<ul><li> Praetorians will shoot at allies, but only if Shepard is an Infiltrator under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Tactical Cloak</a>. You can take advantage of this by putting your squad on the other end of the battlefield and using them to bait the Praetorian into turning around and giving you some free shots at it.
<ul><li> Tactical Cloak is probably the easiest AI Breaker of all, since at maximum ranks (easily achievable by the end of your first one or two post-prologue missions) you get up to six seconds of invisibility (more than enough time to relocate behind the enemy), an extra second or so while shooting (and +75% damage while shooting from under cloak...), and you have a pretty short recharge (enough time to sit behind cover and wait while the enemy whales away at the box you're hiding behind). The AI can't find you while you're under cloak, which translates to Shepard running around the battlefield invisibly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityFlicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityFlicker">dropping cloak every few seconds to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">blast the back of someone's head open</a> with a sniper rifle.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VII</em>, the Champions of the Sword could be easy if you had the Dispell Magic spell. Their AI called for them to buff themselves with Hour of Power, and if you dispelled it, they'd just keep on recasting it and never attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em>, the last section of Telos has an optional battle against the Handmaiden sisters. First you fight one, then two, and then all five. Whoever falls or is forced off the mat first wins. All five will attack you at once and beat you to death instantly. While it is theoretically possible to win fairly, it requires a very specific build. Instead, the easiest way to win is to charge a melee shield, end combat, and place your character right in front of each Handmaiden individually. By doing this, the game has to move the NPC backwards to the minimum attack distance. Repeat until all five are forced off the mat. You win without throwing a punch. Or just use Force Whirlwind, which throws anyone who doesn't save except your target off the mat. Or Horror/Insanity, which gives you 12/18 seconds of freedom to do whatever to prepare for them...like line them up for some good ol' Force Lightning spam.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum2">Avernum 2</a></em>, controlling where you take on your enemies can make all the difference between a decisive win and a total party kill. Enemy casters' aggro radius is one square larger than their spell-casting radius, and while there is a "run up and melee" move in the AI's library, "run forward a couple squares, then stop and use a ranged attack" is not. Thus, if you place a character JUST inside the aggro radius, the caster will waste their entire turn running up towards them, so your melee fighter(s) don't have to spend precious turns under fire getting across a room to them.
</li><li> Deathclaws in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> (and possibly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> as well) will drop pursuit of the player character if you jump onto nearby rocks. Their pathfinding loses their target and they wander off, heedless of the ammunition you're pumping into them.
</li><li> In <em>Fallout 3</em>, you can steal from people who are looking right at you &amp; sitting inches away if you hold an object between yourself &amp; them. You can even do this with tiny objects like books but you have to hold the object in just the right spot.
</li><li> In a similar vein to the Chameleon Armor in Oblivion: In one of the DLC packs for <em>Fallout 3</em>, "Operation Anchorage," there is a suit of Chinese Stealth Armor that is obtained for completing the DLC. If this suit is worn alongside certain perks and a high sneak skill, the player becomes immune to detection whenever they are crouched. With an extremely high sneak skill this becomes ridiculous: players can sneak, during the day, in the open, with their Pip Boy light on, and their radio playing, and enemies 2 feet from them will have no idea they are there, even if said enemies are staring at the player. Bumping into enemies will alert them to your presence, but avoiding them is easy in all but the tightest of confined spaces. This exploit, combined with the automatic 1.5X damage multiplier on sneak attacks makes the game incredibly easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>, rods of summoning didn't have a cap, and enemy AI don't have target preferences, so one tactic used is to summon hordes of weak dogs or other low-level enemies to cause spellcasters to waste spells, keep them from attacking your own squishy mages, and wear the enemies down by attrition. The second game and remake put a hard cap on summons to prevent this kind of exploit.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully">Bully</a></em>, nobody can jump onto cars. You can actually stand on the hood of a car and pick off police officers with your slingshot. They may throw bricks at you, but that's it, they can't do the insta-defeat grab.
</li><li> When taking over an area in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>, the defending gangsters will stick to the sidewalks as much as possible, walking entirely in single file at their default jogging speed. For a player with an assault rifle or sniper rifle, simply having a significant lead on the gangsters and going for headshots can turn the situation on its head.
<ul><li> On a related note, most NPCs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series will only aim and attempt to fire at the player after they are well within the player's lock-on distance, making a player with good aim almost impossible to stop.
</li></ul></li><li> Invaders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> automatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">take the shortest route to get into your fortress</a>, preferentially heading for unlocked doors and avoiding locked ones, even when they have creatures with them capable of bypassing said locked doors. Because of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">it's quite possible</a> to set up the entrance to your fortress with two doors with a long corridor full of weapon traps between them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalDoorUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalDoorUse">constantly switch which of the two is locked</a>, leaving the goblins marching back and forth through fields of +enormous steel corkscrews+ and *giant swinging iron axe blades* until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">blood drips from the ceiling</a>.
<ul><li> This can be exploited even more hilariously (if more complicated to set up) by having two rows of 1x1 retracting bridges that are all linked to the same lever in a way so that you have a checkered pattern of bridges that are retracted when the lever's down and drawbridges that are extended if the lever's down. The invaders need to move diagonally every step to get through there, but even if you switch which of the bridges are retracted and which aren't, there is still always a way. If you order a dwarf to repeatedly pull the lever, the goblins will happily march over the bridges until they suddenly vanish under their feet. Using drawbridges instead of retracting ones is less safe (because big creatures can keep the bridges from operating), but even <em>more</em> hilarious because it flings the goblins!
</li><li> The AI will also dodge attacks without taking into account what it's dodging into and what's it dodging away from. Construct a narrow bridge over a deep pit and cover it with crappy wooden extending/retracting spikes, and even the toughest of (non-flying) enemies will dodge right off the edge and start falling. Nothing in the game is immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">fall damage</a>.
</li><li> AI units do not react to enemies they haven't seen, including ones in hiding, even if they're attacked by them (though they will attempt to dodge or block those attacks). Before a massive overhaul to the game's stealth system in the 2014 version, units in hiding were <em>never</em> found by another unit outside a 7x7 box of tiles one is in the center of. Thus, in Adventure Mode, you could stand as little as four tiles away from an enemy and remain in hiding while shooting bolts and throwing rocks at them until they die. The only time this <em>didn't</em> work is dark places where you couldn't see enemies without getting close enough for them to spot you.
</li><li> The effects of the Building Destroyer ability are also exploitable- a creature with Building Destroyer level 2 is not only capable of battering down doors and destroying levers and various types of buildings, it actually prefers destroying buildings to doing anything else, including attacking your soldiers unless it's defending itself. If one of your soldiers interrupts a troll in the process of battering down a door, for example, the troll will beat the soldier into unconsciousness or immobility, then leave him or her lying there and return to beating on the door. Building destroyers will also happily stand on top of traps and get stabbed repeatedly, if it gets them close to a destroyable building. Capturing many building destroyer creatures is as simple as putting a Door to Nowhere in the middle of a ring of cage traps. And killing one is as simple as installing a nine-tile floor held up by a single support, and watching the creature punch out the support, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">sending the floor above crashing down fatally onto its head</a>.
<ul><li> Building on this, artifacts are indestructible. Put an artifact door, floodgate, hatch cover, or grate near your entrance, put up a marksdwarf post (with fortifications, of course), and prepare to turn any invading building destroyers and any goblins riding them into pincushions. Alternatively, put it in the caverns so you don't have to deal with forgotten beasts.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, for a long time, had enemy AI be very simplistic. If a monster was chasing you, all you had to do was stand in front of a pool of lava and watch the mobs walk straight into it. The AI was coded to walk in a straight path to the player when they spotted them, regardless if there was a lava pit or a cliff in the way. The update to 1.2 enhances the AI to have better path finding so if the player is being chased by a zombie for example, the zombie will attempt to look for alternative paths to the player as long as it doesn't hurt itself. Skeletons were also made smarter by rushing at the player and flanking them should the player hide by a corner of a wall. Enemy mobs can also see through glass and will try to get to the player if they see them through the glass, whereas in the past, glass acted like solid blocks for mobs, thus they couldn't see through it.
<ul><li> Endermen also have an exploit in their AI that can be abused if used right. Endermen take damage from water and if an Endermen is hostile towards you, exposing it to water will cause it to be neutral and stop attacking you.
</li><li> Endermen also have issues with enclosed spaces. Because they are three blocks tall, while players are only two blocks tall, endermen simply can't fit into areas where players can hide, nor can they harm players in such areas. Their AI will lead to them teleporting toward players that look at them, even if they can't hurt that player, as long as the Enderman doesn't encounter water. Simple Endermen traps thus consist solely of a roof.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em>, a computer defending a castle will spread out his archers on the walls and mass everyone else on the ladders. Neither will willingly step down the ladders, so if the archers have been dealt with, an attacking player can hack away with a polearm at the remaining defenders which will simply stand in front of the ladder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has a similar pathfinding problem. Enemies only know how to reach you in a straight line, meaning a simple thin lava pit on either side of a house means infinite money as the enemies stroll in and immolate themselves. On the flip side, this will usually destroy loot in the underground areas where the lava is too deep. Enemies are also too stupid to walk around an obstacle when you're above them, since they only target you by the y-axis. This allows to effectively lock some enemies on a higher level of blocks (which you can often build on the fly if hotkeyed) while attacking others.
<ul><li> <em>Terraria</em> has another trick that can be useful when protecting your home during the Blood Moon. Doors open in either direction, but zombies normally can't open them if they're shut. This changes during the Blood Moon, but zombies only gain the ability to kick doors <em>in.</em> Due to the way the game handles sprites, putting anything other than a wall tile on one side of a door will prevent it from opening, meaning that if you simply hang a colored banner behind a door, it only opens outward and is thus zombie-proof.
</li></ul></li><li> The sword fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> is difficult as Jyunichi will block most regular slashes and you are expected to parry and counterattack. If you drop the sword though, you can punch him as easily as you would puch any other punk.
</li><li> AI Gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em> will always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">fireball</a> your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Creature</a> if you send it into their village. Your Creature can easily counter this with a Rain Miracle (and will do it instinctively if it knows the spell, it doesn't even need to be taught). The villagers aren't so lucky. With this, you can use your Creature as bait to trick the enemy God into torching their own empire without spending a point of your own Mana, or getting a single point of bad Karma (if you care about such things).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a></em> games feature a partial aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFriction">Space Friction</a> (i.e. you can drift in one direction with thrusters off while facing another), a straight example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace">2-D Space</a> (gameplay bears a strong resemblance to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Asteroids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Asteroids">Asteroids</a></em>), and an A.I. whose idea of combat tactics is to fly straight at the target while firing every weapon it can hit with. These three factors result in three tactics that have become so well known in the fandom that they've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackPatternAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackPatternAlpha">acquired names</a>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> Maneuver consists of flying away from your target while firing backwards. The A.I. chases and runs right into your fire. (The name is a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>, specifically the scene where the knights collectively yell "Run away!")
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a> Maneuver is a blockade-running technique that consists of flying away from the destination to lure the blockade away from it, then doubling back around them. It acquired a variation in <em>EV Nova</em>: since space <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography">is apparently toroidal</a>, all you have to do is fly in a straight line and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapAround">Wrap Around</a>. Of course, this maneuver works best if your ship is faster than the blockade.
</li><li> The Qaanol Maneuver, named after its inventor's forum handle, consists of flying an absurdly small and fast ship to draw the enemy's fire while your more heavily armed escorts make the kill.

Their anti-fighter missiles fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAmmo">eight warheads at a time</a> and can be fired in salvos of 8 to 12, with almost zero down-time between salvos. Generally, firing them at fighters causes them to hilariously spin around wildly to delay their inevitable death. Capital ships try to shoot down the powerful and fast Hammer Heavy Torpedo missiles with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">Painfully Slow Projectile</a> firing turrets which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure">pan painfully slow</a>. <em>X3: Albion Prelude</em> gives the AI (and player) access to the Mosquito Missile Defense, which turns the otherwise worthless Mosquito Missile into an automatic missile defense, which launches and intercepts incoming missiles, making the Missile Frigate less of an AI breaker.
</li><li> The pathfinding in general can break the AI. Place a Solar Power Plant in front of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">jump gate</a> and AI ships cannot leave the currently loaded sector without blowing up, as the AI doesn't know how to use the <em>other</em> side of the jump gate, though leaving the sector disables the collision detection, allowing ships to escape. When flying around, ships can only check the area immediately in front of them for obstacles, which can lead to bog-standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceTrucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceTrucker">Space Trucker</a> ships smearing themselves across the side of your capital ship because they only noticed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">Mile-Long Ship</a> after it was too late to turn. Fighter craft attacking moving capital ships have a tendency to splatter themselves into the sides of the ship (or each other). Egosoft went out of their way to rectify this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth">X Rebirth</a></em>, and still had to partly cheat by disabling collisions between NPC capital ships due to the densely packed areas.
</li><li> <em>X-Tension</em> had spectacularly broken dogfight AI. Normally it'd kinda-sorta work, with ships shooting other ships and trying not to get shot themselves, but if the player sat his ship 200 metres or less behind an enemy and matched their speed with it, the AI would stop <em>all</em> maneuvering and just fly in a straight line forever. They would only swerve away if shot at, which still gave the player all the time in the world to line up the perfect shot, and you could still land enough hits before your target managed to maneuver away to effortlessly destroy it or try getting the enemy pilot to eject.
</li><li> Up until <em>Terran Conflict</em> guided missiles were entirely unable to deal with a ship that had the strafing extension mounted. If you kept strafing no missile would ever hit you, narrowly missing every time as they failed to calculate the correct movement vector of your ship.
</li><li> Having trouble with one of the faster capital ships (or *any* capital ship, if you've installed a speed rebalance mod)? Just park yourself so that a station or an asteroid is between you and the ship. It will come at you at full bore and only notice the obstacle much too late. Result: one destroyed capital ship and one slightly repositioned station or asteroid.
</li></ul></li><li> Not exactly useful, but fun: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFactionGuerrilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFactionGuerrilla">Red Faction: Guerrilla</a></em>, if you steal a tank or walker, the alert level will stay at red pretty much forever... unless you take it back to a safehouse. Entering one of these will always reset the alert to green. Now you can safely go back out and have some fun with the civilians, who are in <em>no</em> way programmed to handle a giant death engine stomping through town.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a></em>, the most enemy units cannot resist a locked door. There are two ways this can be used to your advantage.
<ul><li> Carve a path into the mountain that leads to nothing but a series of locked doors (with maybe some traps at the end, just for fun), and watch thieves and infiltrators waste their time accomplishing absolutely nothing.
</li><li> If an enemy unit is about to break through an important locked door, simply unlock it. The unit will suddenly lose interest and wander off in a random direction.

Chomp determines this based on what it sees from a camera mounted at the front. Its first match was against Warrior Dragon, whose very low height proved to be the A.I.'s undoing. Not only was it too short for the camera to see properly, Warrior Dragon's team captain, Luke Ewert, observed the way Chomp would recover from getting tipped on its side and figured out that, by putting Warrior Dragon next to Chomp's underside each time it tried to recover, Chomp would tip itself back onto its side each time it tried. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Chomp has a manual override specifically for opponents who could find ways to exploit the A.I.</a>, however, which averted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> and allowed Chomp to keep fighting to the end, upon which there was a split decision from the judges. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Warrior Dragon won.</span>

<ul><li> In the novel <em>Epic</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAvatarChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAvatarChronicles">The Avatar Chronicles</a></em> by Conor Kostick, about a world-spanning government based on an MMORPG, this is a plot point, when the main character Erik figures out that the extremely lethal Red Dragon can be defeated by a group of comparatively low-level characters by exploiting its attack patterns- it will always attack the one who dealt the most damage, or, if the damage is roughly equal, whoever attacked the most recently. He gets a group of characters together with an insane amount of arrows, and two party members take turns firing at the dragon from opposite directions, so the dragon can't make it to the first attacker before the second attacker triggers it to move in the other direction (with backup archers in case either one misses), repeating until the dragon suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> (and when both the main and backup archers fail, Erik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro">Draw Aggro</a> move becomes <em>very</em> useful).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CommanderKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CommanderKitty">Commander Kitty</a></em>, Zenith Central's defenses are designed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadTheTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadTheTarget">lead their fire</a> - but they apparently do so by firing in front of the target ship, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.commanderkitty.com/2011/06/18/two-minutes-unsportsmanlike-conduct/">so flying backwards confuses them.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperMinion">Super Minion</a></em>, Tofu is an almost perfect martial artist. This is useful for normal opponents, but against Adder it's something of a liability because as long as she knows the ideal move from his position she knows exactly what he'll do, and can use that to direct the fight towards a situation where she can win. It annoys Tofu to no end until she explains it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, this is the reasoning behind the switching tactic: monsters generated by the Cardinal System are intended to adapt to whoever's fighting them more and more as the fight drags on, so suddenly switching who's attacking causes a brief freeze in their A.I. while they adjust to the new opponent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss fights</a> can be won or lost based on how effective the raid party is at switching efficiently.
</li><li> A 60s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> story dealt with an incident where Luthor built a machine that created Kryptonite and went to rob Fort Knox, and as Superman was away, one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotMe">Robot Mes</a> stepped up to try to handle him. However, Luthor trapped and defeated the robot easily, as even though it was immune to Kryptonite, it was programmed to always avoid it and treat it as dangerous to maintain the ruse of it being the real Superman. Luthor reveals at the end of the story that the Kryptonite created by the machine was fake, and completely harmless - and when he realizes that the robot wasn't the real Superman, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory">so disgusted that he gives all the gold back,</a> because the real Superman would have never fallen for such a ploy (more likely, he would have tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightOffTheKryptonite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightOffTheKryptonite">Fight Off the Kryptonite</a> and then immediately figured out it was fake).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaloBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaloBox">Megalo Box</a></em>, Joe does this against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">a combat-style analyzing AI</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">refusing to take a stance, or do anything at all</a>. The AI's creator designed it to run his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Gear</a> and fight for him, but also didn't design it to lash out randomly at people not taking boxing stances, hence leaving it useless until the designer manually overrides the AI's decisions.
