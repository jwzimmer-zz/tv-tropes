The host must not harm the guest, the guest must not harm the host, and not offering in the first place is a serious affront. In Ancient Greek, hospitality was called <em>xenia</em> and was sacred; Zeus was called Zeus Xenios in his function as god and guarantor of hospitality and protectors of guests. This comes from the word for "stranger"; so, for that matter, does "hospitality". Another word from that root is "hostile", which helps explain why the rules are so severe.

This is before the runaway is revealed as a murderer (the people she killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">needed to go, though.</a>) Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> shows up to arrest her, but not only did Wonder Woman promise her guest protection and hospitality, the guest also invoked the titular Hiketeia, a ritual that requires that Wonder Woman does not discharge her guest without the guest's consent, on pain of death from the Erinyes, who will kill her if she does so. Since Wonder Woman's life is forfeit if she surrenders the girl and Batman (unaware of this deal) is not just going to let the girl get away with murder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">Wonder Woman and Batman end up fighting to the death over the situation and their conflicting morals.</a> The girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Takes A Third Option</a> and leaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">off a bridge.</a> Notably, Batman himself tries to invoke the Hiketeia so that Wondy wouldn't be able to stop him without breaking her oath, but she informs him that she has the right to refuse it if she chooses.

</li><li> Sacred Hospitality is important between mythological creatures in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> universe: When Morpheus offers hospitality to his guests in <em>Season of Mists</em> he is physically incapable of breaking it or allowing harm to any of his guests (whether he was aware they were his guests when he offered it or not), unless they reject or violate it first. Notably, hospitality has to be offered first: Lucifer nearly kills Morpheus in the first volume after having not offered any hospitality or safety to him, but when the two later meet in <em>Season of Mists</em> Morpheus is willing to trust Lucifer when he does give his word that no harm will befall Morpheus within the boundaries of Hell.
<ul><li> A demon visiting the Dreaming while holding one of Morpheus's ex-lovers captive makes the mistake of rejecting his hospitality, and ends up in a jar in his attic.

Unfortunately for Ben, Jimmy (who was the son of up-and-coming crime lord Fortunado, and trying to lay low from his father for a while) took him up on that offer when he needed a place to stay; despite the fact that Jimmy was <em>not</em> the most pleasant roommate, Ben kept his word. (And Ben was able to prevent a crisis later when Fortunado did make his move because of it; plus, Jimmy remembered it, and was an occasional ally of Peter, who took over again as Spidey after Ben's death at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>.)

It's not just a breach of manners and trust, it's a breach of the gods' laws.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Necrophim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Necrophim">Necrophim</a></em>: Lord Lucifer violates it by killing an emissary of King Jotunheim with full knowledge that he will take it as an insult and a violation of guest rights.

<ul><li> Jaime Lannister breaks it early on when he pushes Bran, a son of his host Eddard Stark, out of the window <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Bran catches him having sex with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">his sister</a> Cersei</span>.
</li><li> When Robb Stark returns to Walder Frey after violating his marriage pact to one of the Frey daughters, Catelyn urges the importance of requesting bread and salt, since that would make Robb a guest and free from fear of reprisal during his stay. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It doesn't work. In a shocking violation of Sacred Hospitality, the Freys and their secret allies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">the Boltons</a>, slaughter their guests in what is later called "The Red Wedding". Even their newfound allies are sickened by their actions and the Freys become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>.</span> This even has further implications, as it basically lowers the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">already low</a>) morality of the entire realm, as it was considered the one rule that even the warring lords would stick to. When it becomes clear that they won't, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">and won't be held accountable for it</a>, the number of people violating sacred hospitality, or terrified that their guests might do so, skyrockets following the Red Wedding, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the Freys are gradually picked off in retribution for this</span>.

He waits, however, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">they leave his home, with gifts that formally symbolize their parting</a>. Fearing that the pies are poison, his enemies wait until Manderly eats them first, which he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTastesGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTastesGood">with gusto</a>.
<ul><li> Manderly also uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> earlier, as there Ain't No Rule that says you can't kill your guests <em>after</em> they've left your presence, especially as you've given them parting gifts to mark their leaving — a pair of fast horses that encourage the Freys to ride ahead of Manderly's slow-moving caravan so they can be ambushed away from witnesses.
</li></ul></li><li> Illyrio shows an unusual, perhaps idiosyncratic version when a depressed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyrion</span> is a guest in the Free Cities: when his guest plans suicide by eating a poisonous mushroom, Illyrio openly offers him a mushroom dish that night at dinner. When the guest wryly notes that serving poison to your guests is hardly hospitable, Illyrio replies that if a guest desires to die then it's his responsibility as a gracious host to put them out of their misery. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once Tyrion considers that and decides not to eat the mushroom dish, Illyrio eats some of it, demonstrating that he wasn't actually serving poison at his dinner table <em>and</em> that Tyrion doesn't want to die quite as badly as he thought he did.</span>

Instead, the blame is placed on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyrion</span>, in part due to coincidence, in part due to bad blood between the victim and supposed perpetrator, in part due to having been appointed the victim's cupbearer (as a mockery), but mainly because it offers several members of his family a convenient way to finally kill him after years of trying in vain to be rid of him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately for them, this scapegoating ultimately ends with Tyrion murdering Tywin in cold blood and fleeing for Essos, and marks a point in the series where the Crown descends into utter chaos, which the Tyrells use to increase their status.</span>
</li><li> Sacred Hospitality looms large when the Night's Watch stay at the wildling Craster's hold, due to mutual dislike. The Night's Watch presents a gift during their first stay, and Mormont grudgingly defers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Craster's</a> demands to keep Craster as one of their allies beyond the Wall, of which they have only a few. When the Watch returns, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a few members violate the rules by demanding better food and eventually attacking Craster. Shocked members of the Watch attack the violators, resulting in a deadly melee</span>.
<ul><li> In a slight twist, the first time he's at Craster's, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Jon</a> specifically chooses to avoid accepting food from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Craster</a> or sleeping by his fire because he doesn't want to be bound by rules of hospitality to Craster as he is morally opposed to Craster's terrible treatment of people.
</li></ul></li><li> Sacred Hospitality is also taken seriously by the wildlings. Jon Snow is a member of the Night's Watch and when he is captured by wildlings and taken to their King Mance Rayder, Mance assures Jon that he has Guest Right and therefore, he won't be harmed that night as they have shared shelter and food that day.
</li><li> The legend of the Rat Cook is related to the reader just to demonstrate how seriously the Westerosi take Guest Right (as they call it). The Rat Cook was a cook in the Night's Watch. One day, a king who had previously insulted the cook comes to the Wall and, as retribution, the cook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">killed the prince (also at the Wall), put him in a pie, and served it to the king</a>. The storyteller notes that the Rat Cook was punished by the gods<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1q73j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1q73j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1q73j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was turned into a rat, always damned to eat its own sons</span> not for the murder, regicide, or cannibalism — "for a man has a right to vengeance" — but for violating Guest Right. This story inspires Wyman Manderly's own actions.
</li><li> Though it's unclear whether or not there really are gods who enforce the Guest Right, all of the above who have violated Guest Right end up suffering a great deal later in the story, whether or not other people <em>know</em> they violated the Guest Right. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Freys are hated by all and are slowly being picked off one by one, courtesy of Lady Stoneheart and Wyman Manderly. Manderly himself is suspected of being behind the disappearance of the Freys he did murder, but no one can prove it. He is slashed across the neck during a fight by one of those who suspect him, but survives. Jaime Lannister loses a hand, and Cersei Lannister's sanity begins to slip. The Night's Watch mutineers seem to survive, but Coldhands kills them as they attempt to make south for the Wall. The Tyrells don't suffer immediately, but Loras suffers a gruesome injury in the battle of Dragonstone, and the last seen of him is that he is in grave condition.</span>
</li><li> One of Dorne's most infamous actions was when, during Daeron the Young Dragon's Conquest, the Dornish called for parley and proceeded to murder him, half his Kingsguard and several of his lords under a peace banner. That they managed to not only go unscathed for such betrayal (because Baelor, Daeron's brother and successor, commanded a stop to the attacks and made peace with Dorne), but that they later gained great influence in court during Daeron II's reign, was one of the causes of the First Blackfyre Rebellion.

This is despite the fact that the dwarves weren't invited to Bilbo's home. To the dwarves' credit, they thought they <em>were</em> invited thanks to Gandalf's manipulations. When they found they weren't, the dwarves did the dishes after the meal. At the end of the story, after Bilbo has left the dwarves — both sides have assured each other that hospitality will be extended in the future — he gives the elf king a gift because Bilbo had eaten the king's food while skulking about his halls.
<div class="indent"><em>Then the dwarves bowed low before their Gate, but words stuck in their throats. "Good-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said Balin at last. "If ever you visit us again, when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!" <br/>"If ever you are passing my way," said Bilbo, "don't wait to knock! Tea is at four; but any of you are welcome at any time!"</em>

While he gives other excuses, the explanation is to the effect that he's familiar with the importance of hospitality in Arab tradition, and knows that it wouldn't be right to revenge himself on them if he shared their food. It's how Mercedes gets her first hint that the Count doesn't have her husband's best interests at heart, since he refuses food she herself gives him.
<ul><li> This is also one of the reasons why he gives extravagant gifts (as well as being part of his persona and to ingratiate himself with people) — he wants to be in nobody's debt. Whenever someone tries to give him a gift, he gives them a more valuable one to even things out.

When strangers arrived, the male head of a household would leave his own house and allow the stranger to live there as if it were his own, and as if all the females of the household were his own wives. The people of Kamul felt so strongly about this custom that when the Khan banned it, they sent a delegation to ask him to reverse his decision, which he did. Pretty lousy for the wives, though...

The various supernatural groups also have a treaty detailing diplomacy and hospitality and various other aspects of supernaturals dealing with each other. Also, hospitality <em>means</em> something. Any being's home has a magical barrier at the door referred to as the threshold. Crossing the threshold without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustBeInvited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustBeInvited">being invited in</a> means leaving a chunk of your power at the door if they can enter at all. How much power they lose is determined by how much the dwelling is a home. Dresden's basement bachelor apartment, inhabited for not much more than ten years, doesn't have much stopping power, but a friend's home, inhabited by the same family for about a hundred years, has a hell of a kick.
<ul><li> Upon fleeing from two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Red Court Vampire assassins</a> and their pet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a>; Harry runs through an unexplored region of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">NeverNever</a> and they all drop into the freaking throne room of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Lord</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">The Wild Hunt</a>. Right as said near-godly being is about to execute them all, the Erl-King ironically refers to them as guests. Harry immediately grabs at that, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolitenessJudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolitenessJudo">thanks the Fey-Lord for granting them his hospitality</a>. The Erl-King is amused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">and impressed</a> by his quick thinking, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. He accepts Harry as a "guest", saying that he can hunt him another day.
<ul><li> Of course, being a guest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> has its own dangers. The Erl-King points out that, as a host, it would be within his right as a host to keep Harry as a guest for a few centuries. And since the Red Court contingent claim Harry brought them there on purpose for the Erl-king to kill them for Harry while Harry said it was an accident, the Erl-king decides the best way to deal with these conflicting claims is let the sword decide and make them battle a duel. Winner will receive the hospitality, the loser will be treated as an invader to his land. Erl-king notes that if Harry wins and the Red Court tried to save their people, it would be an insult that would draw <em>all the Fae</em> (Winter, Summer, and Wylde) into attacking the Red Court.
</li></ul></li><li> And in the event a Fae enters a home <em>uninvited</em> they are still bound by the laws of hospitality. They cannot leave the home in a worse place than when they arrived, hence the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brownies</span> being able to enter and clean Harry's home, provided he never speak of them. Even if the host attacks the Fae, the Fae cannot respond with hostile action. Most would simply leave the home and when the person is not inside the home any longer, respond for the previous action.
</li><li> Also, certain entities, like the inhabitants of Faerie are essentially bound by their language and betrayal of the Laws of Hospitality border on conceptually impossible for them. Getting them to promise their hospitality, however...
<ul><li> The Laws strictly bind the Faerie and all members of their Courts. We see a key instance of what happens if someone tries to break the Laws in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays">Cold Days</a></em>. Also, even when the hospitality is granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> very heavily come into play (The Fae follow their rules at any cost, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">magically compelled to never lie</a>, but that means there are <em>no</em> better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abusers</a>. In fact, one of those rules <em>is</em> there is no spirit of the law, only its letter. As such, beware harming or insulting one, or trapping one into actions theyd <em>really</em> be against taking - youre not safe just because <em>here and now</em> they find themselves forbidden to vaporize you with a magic blast. The moment youre no longer covered under hospitality, or have angered them enough to make you suffer in every way the rules and/or their promises dont explicitly prohibit, expect your life to get considerably worse and considerably shorter.)

He finds the friend, Vetch, whose initial reaction is surprise and fear because he does not recognize him. Vetch immediately apologizes for that and has him stay in his own home.
<ul><li> Sacred hospitality actually appears pretty deeply ingrained in Earthsea, in both the Hardic and Kargad lands. Despite Ged's private gripe, his boat was provisioned for free on the island where people thought he might be some kind of demon, and the innkeeper who told him their island already had a wizard (who turned out to be his friend) gave him free lodging, food, and ale. Staff-carrying wizards almost never pay for such things, or for ship's passage. There is only one story where a character uses a fake staff to take advantage of this. But while hospitality to wizards is mere common sense, there are many examples in the stories of non-wizards (or wizards in disguise) getting the benefit of sacred hospitality.

<ul><li> He may be an unrepentant misanthropic recluse, but his code of honor means that he will be in every way the impeccable host if someone calls upon his hospitality. Over the course of the series, he's hosted murder suspects, witnesses, and clients for dinner, invited them to view his orchids, and even given them a room to sleep in overnight should they need it. As well as a matter of honour, however, it also serves a double purpose in that it enables him to keep someone who has every reason to want to run as far as they can get (such as someone suspected of or guilty of murder) right where a close eye can be kept on them.
</li><li> He also upholds the duty of the <em>guest</em> on the few times that he's obliged to leave his own home. In one novel, when he discovers that one of the other guests of the family he's staying with is the murderer he's looking for, he arranges spurious reasons for all of the family members to leave the house and then tells the murderer that he's onto them. The murderer flees, right into a police roadblock that Wolfe set up ahead of time. This is all so that his hosts are neither discomfited by having the murderer arrested in their home nor are put in the position of having to violate Sacred Hospitality by turning him over to the police themselves. It also serves to thwart a particularly obnoxious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> by embarrassing him when he shows up to arrest the murderer at the house, unprepared for Wolfe's shenanigans.
</li><li> In keeping with all this, it's generally not a good idea to try murdering someone who is enjoying Wolfe's hospitality or has come to him seeking help while they're in Wolfe's house, as he will take this as a personal insult and stop at nothing to expose and ruin you in response.

Guests are to be given useful work to do so that they don't feel like bums. But when you get an invite, you have to accept it at some point or give <em>major</em> offense, and if you're dealing with a family that has a particularly nasty gift, giving offense is a very bad idea.

Blake uses this to protect himself by inviting all his enemies over, preventing them from simply raiding his apartment.

Conrad makes his home ready but is interrupted three times: the first by a man with tattered shoes, who Conrad gives a new pair of shoes. The second is a beggar woman, who Conrad invites in to have a hot meal. The third is a lost child, who Conrad invites in, feeds, and then helps find their home. When the sun sets and Jesus has yet to appear, he despairs, only for the Lord to appear and say that he was the shoeless man, the beggar, and the lost child.

He also explains that, should Duncan leave his home, he would be captured and executed. Naturally, Duncan chuckles at the thought, until the samurai explains that he would be executed by beheading (which kills immortals too).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Mythology and Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek mythology</a> is full of examples. Zeus himself was patron of hospitality (as well as most other social laws), so breaking Sacred Hospitality, either by host or guest, would incur his fury.
<ul><li> The poor, elderly couple Baucis and Philemon received with glad hospitality two weary travelers whom their wealthier neighbors had driven off. Since these travelers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">Zeus and Hermes</a>, they quickly realized that their supplies refused to run out no matter how much they and their guests took. Recognizing that they must be playing host to gods, the couple prostrated themselves before their guests. The gods then turned their neighbors' village into a lake, and transformed the stingy neighbors into fish, and then told Baucis and Philemon that they would be granted a wish. The old couple replied that their wish was that they should die at the same moment so neither of them had to live widowed. When they did die, they were outside their home looking at that lake, and because Zeus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">can be a softie sometimes</a>, he turned the old couple into two trees, their branches forever intertwined in love, forever looking out on one of the most beautiful vistas in Greece.
<ul><li> On the flip side, take the example of Lycaon. He and his sons <em>knew</em> Zeus made a habit of randomly dropping by to check on xenia, host and guest alike, so when they happened to get a visitor one night, they suspected his real identity. What do they do to make sure? Why, <em>cook a child into a stew</em>, following Tantalus' example (seen further along on the page). Zeus literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheTable">flips the table</a>, turns Lycaon and his brood into the first werewolves remarking that only their appearance changed, nothing within, and had the kid brought back to life. Made even worse by some versions which specify that Lycaon used to have a daughter, Kallisto, who... Zeus fancied... to put it in polite terms. Kallisto was turned into a bear (for being raped or for keeping her pregnancy secret from Artemis, whose hunter she was), but gave birth to a son, and this son was the child Lycaon cooked.
</li></ul></li><li> King Diomedes of Thrace violated hospitality by attacking any travelers who encountered his kingdom and feeding them to his man-eating mares. Eventually, Heracles defeated him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">fed him to his own mares</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alcestis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alcestis">Alcestis</a></em>, when Admetus' wife sacrificed herself for him and then Heracles appeared at his home, Admetus tried to hide that he was in mourning for his wife because they considered hospitality sacred. As a result, he allowed Heracles to carouse and carry on. When Heracles finally learned of the death, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">deeply embarrassed at having behaved so festively in a house of mourning -- even unawares --</a> and went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">wrestle</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a> to reclaim her.
<ul><li> Admetus is pretty famous for this trope, actually. He once sheltered Apollo when the latter was sentenced to spend a year as a mortal for killing (variously) Delphyne or the Cyclops. As a reward Apollo not only served as Admetus' cowherd during that time, ensuring that all the cows bore twins, but later helped Admetus win the eponymous Alcestis' hand in marriage. He also convinced the Fates to allow Admetus to forgo the expected day of his death if Admetus could find someone to die in his stead. Alcestis eventually volunteered to do so, leading to the above encounter with Heracles.
</li></ul></li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a> one: Procrustes the blacksmith, and innkeeper of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnOfNoReturn">Inn of No Return</a>, who offered xenia then broke it. You see, he would let guests stay at his house and stay in this special iron bed. However, if they proved shorter than the bed, he would stretch them out to get them to full size; if they were too tall, he would cut them to size. What if they were exactly the right size? Funny, that: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">he secretly had two beds</a>. Eventually, Theseus captured him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">"fitted" him to the bed he had used to murder passersby</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">No one knows whether Theseus had to stretch or chop Procrustes</a>.
</li><li> King Midas, despite being greedy, was very hospitable, and this was what eventually got him in trouble. When his servants caught the old satyr Silenus drunk and passed out after trespassing on his royal grounds, Midas ordered him bathed and fed, and politely entertained him for ten days before taking him back to Dionysus in Lydia. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold. The god warned Midas that he had made a foolish wish, but he granted it, and as everyone familiar with the story knows, Dionysus was right. In some versions of the myth, when Midas begs to recant his wish, Dionysus specifically refers to Midas' hospitality, saying basically "you should not suffer for that."
</li><li> Ixion broke hospitality rules in the most amazingly stupid ways. He invited his family over for a feast, including Deioneus, the father of his recently-wed wife, Dia. To get back at Deioneus for taking his livestock as "payment" for Dia, Ixion pushed him into a flaming bed and was exiled for the kinslaying/hospitality breach. Then Zeus, feeling sorry for the guy (after all, as far as reasons for hospitality breaches go, being forced to pay an excessive bride-price is at least comprehensible), invited him up to hang out with the rest of the gods; they figured he was a terrible host, but this time he's a guest and his hosts are gods, he'll have some sense, right? <em>WRONG.</em> They didn't count on Ixion being stone-cold crazy. Let's see what happened next, folks:
<ul><li> During the feast, <em>he felt up Hera in front of everyone</em>. He wasn't even slick about it. He was trying because he didn't have the balls to do it openly, but he was kind of a screwup and kept being way too obvious about it. And he was still staring at her and breathing way too hard.
</li><li> So Zeus decided to test his guest; he formed up some clouds into a Hera-shaped sex doll and floated it by Ixion's room at night. Ixion <em>raped</em> it. Let that sink in for a moment. Ixion was willing to rape Zeus's wife, in Zeus's house, when Zeus put up his exiled ass out of the kindness of his godly heart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection">Ixion would have done that to the King of the Gods</a>; clearly, this was a man who had passed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> some time ago. Zeus thus decided to make the next few moments of Ixion's life, shall we say, electrifying. You could say it was a rather shocking affair. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">You could almost say</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt</a>, even.
</li><li> After Zeus was through, Ixion was thrown into Tartarus, chained to a wheel, set on fire and left to burn for all eternity. The Hera sex doll gave birth to the Centaurs. And, ladies and gentlemen, this is why <em>you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">do not abuse the hospitality of the Greek gods</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Showing that even demigods were not immune to this, Tantalus, who was a son of Zeus. For some reason, the Olympians liked him enough to attend one of his banquets. When he noticed that his larder wasn't fully stocked with enough meat to prepare the feast, he decided to supplement it with his <em>own son</em> Pelops. This revolted the Olympians<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35724');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35724" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35724');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except, in some stories, Demeter, who was so worked up about missing Persephone that she ate a bit of Pelops' shoulder; it was replaced with a magical bit of ivory</span> who revived the boy but decided to give Tantalus a chance to redeem himself as their guest. What did Tantalus do? He <em>stole their ambrosia</em>, shared it with his mortal friends, and blabbed the secrets of the gods. Tantalus stole the food of the gods and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">bragged about it</a></em>. His punishment was just as nasty as Ixion's. Since Tantalus' crimes were food-related, he was condemned to eternal starvation and thirst in Tartarus. He was chained to a tree laden with ripe fruit while waist-deep in fresh water, with the nasty catch that the tree branches would lift the fruit out of his reach and the water would recede whenever he tried to take a sip. Thus the origin of the word "tantalize".
<ul><li> Tantalus' bit with Pelops leads to a whole chain of curses—many of them involving parents killing children or the other way around—that end up defining a good chunk of Greek Myth, including the breach of hospitality that started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>. On one hand, Pelops, as King of Pisa (the one in the Peloponnese), curses Laios, the King of Thebes, after a particularly severe breach of hospitality: Laios raped and abducted Chrysippus—Pelops' son—while a guest in Pisa, leading Pelops to cry, "May your own son kill you, Theban!" This curse is what leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">that famous bit with Laios getting killed and his son marrying his wife</a>, which in turn leads to the Seven Against Thebes, regarded as a warm-up to the Trojan War. In the meantime, Pelops' other son Atreus became King of Mycenae—a very good gig—but his other brother Thyestes makes the mistake of seducing Mrs. Atreus while a guest in the Mycenae royal palace (a major breach of hospitality). Atreus finds out and in revenge slaughters Thyestes' sons and serves them up to their father, tricking him into eating them (which, revenge or no, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">still a breach of hospitality</a>). Thystes then curses Atreus, whose sons are Menelaus and Agamemnon, whose tale is partly recorded above. Of course, then you get into the interesting story of how Agamemnon gets killed by his wife (who was seeing Thyestes' son Aegisthus after the Iphigenia story), who then gets killed by her son Orestes and daughter Electra, the former of whom goes mad until absolved by an Athenian court (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustSoStory">creating the presumption of innocence in the Athenian justice system</a>, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aeschylus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOresteia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOresteia">The Oresteia</a></em> is to be believed).
</li></ul></li><li> The reason the Trojan War started was not only because Paris stole Menelaus' wife (and because all of Helen's other suitors had made an oath to help her husband defend her, if it came to it — the oath was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Odysseus</a> had prevented a huge war among all the kings of Greece when she first came of age) — but because Paris was Menelaus' <em>guest</em> when he did so. The fact that he was visiting Menelaus' kingdom was, in fact, the only reason he ever met Helen. The other kings showed up because of their oath — but it's likely that the war would never have continued for so long if Paris hadn't broken the laws of hospitality at the same time he made off with Helen.
</li><li> Bellerophon was an unwitting beneficiary of hospitality's protection. The wife<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ikxd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ikxd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ikxd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Her name is disputed</span> of his first host (Proetus of Tiryns) attempted to seduce him, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">claimed Bellerophon had ravished her when he refused</a>. Suitably enraged, Proetus wanted to kill Bellerophon, but as Bellerophon was his guest he could not honourably take revenge. So he instead gave him a missive to be delivered to his father-in-law, Iobates of Lycia. On arriving in Lycia, Bellerophon and his new host feasted for several days before the missive was opened, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseShootTheMessenger">containing a request that the recipient kill the bearer of said message</a>. Now Bellerophon was protected doubly by hospitality. So Iobates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">devised suicidal tasks for Bellerophon to accomplish</a>...which he accomplished repeatedly.
</li><li> When Leto wandered into Lycia, she tried to drink from a pool. The peasants there stirred it up until it was too muddy to drink. She turned them into frogs.
</li><li> Other examples of hosts trying to kill guests by requesting potentially lethal favors of them in Greek Mythology were Polydectes to Perseus and Aeetes to Jason.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>:
<ul><li> Odysseus's conflict with Polyphemus. After eating some of the cyclops' cheese, Odysseus insists that they wait for him to return and offer him wine as a gift. However, Polyphemus violates hospitality by eating some of Odysseus' men and then imprisoning the rest to eat later (believing himself not to be subject to Zeus because he is a son of Poseidon). Figuring the rules of hospitality don't apply anymore, Odysseus gets Polyphemus drunk and blinds him.
</li><li> The reason why Odysseus slaughters the suitors in his home rather than just kick them out is that they had violated the rules of hospitality by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">refusing to leave</a> when his wife had asked. Sacred hospitality goes both ways, after all; you're supposed to respect your host in return for them providing food and shelter. In fact, the gods demand that he kill them.
</li><li> Inversely, the swineherd Eumaeus, upon having a beggar (actually Odysseus in disguise) ask for shelter, proceeds to let the man in and treat him about as well as a man of his resources can do so, letting the beggar take his choice of the food and even slaughtering a few of his pigs so they can eat well. Eumaeus's recognition of sacred hospitality is meant to be a sign that he is someone Odysseus can trust.
</li><li> There's an incredible irony here, intentional or not. The whole reason Odysseus had been put through hell and took so long to get home to his wife was that Poseidon, Polyphemus' father, sought revenge for his son being blinded after Polyphemus asked him to make Odysseus' life as miserable as possible, despite the fact that Polyphemus had violated a divine law himself. Yet, Odysseus himself honored this law in one important turning point of the story and inflicted punishment on those who violated it in another. So does this prove that Odysseus is more honorable than a god who does not respect a law that he and his fellows put in place? Like many stories involving the Greek gods' interactions with mortals, yes.
</li></ul></li><li> There are many cases in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> of people offering hospitality. Apparently, in their culture, it was a great insult to imply that someone was a bad host. Also, going incognito by calling oneself just "Gestr" ("Guest") was acceptable. Odin did it occasionally.
<ul><li> Often the gods find themselves forced to put up with a troublemaker because they had already offered him (or her) their hospitality. The most well-known example is found in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em> poem "Lokasenna" ("Loki's Quarrel"), where the gods attend a feast in Aegir's hall and Loki exploits the rule of hospitality by insulting every single one of them repeatedly because he knows they can't resort to violence against him without breaking the law of hospitality. In the end, however, the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> when Thor arrives late to the feast and threatens to hit Loki with his hammer — and Loki leaves because he knows that Thor is the only one there who actually <em>will</em> hit him.
</li><li> Indeed, the first and oldest half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Hávamál</a>, one of the few gnomic Norse texts, is almost entirely dedicated to explaining why and how one should be a good host.
</li></ul></li><li> Pele (the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes), <a class="urllink" href="http://www.learningtogive.org/materials/folktales/Calabash.asp">put off by the rich and welcomed by the poor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, curses the former and blesses the latter, and so children are warned to be kind to strangers, who might be Pele.
</li><li> There is an Arab story of a burglar who entered the Sultan's palace and stole a bag, which he thought contained sugar (back then a valuable commodity and very much worth stealing). On opening the bag, he found it actually contained salt. As salt is a symbol of hospitality, there was no honorable thing to do but bring it back and leave it. When the guards guessed what had happened, the Sultan ordered that the city be searched. When the thief was found, the Sultan showered him with riches because he had risked his life for Sacred Hospitality.
</li><li> A similar story has it that a burglar is about finished when he finds a small box with what he thinks is sugar. When he tastes it and realizes it is salt, he puts everything back.
</li><li> Shows fairly often in <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em>. For example, in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliBabaAndTheFortyThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliBabaAndTheFortyThieves">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</a>", a dinner guest at Ali Baba's house says that he is unable to eat anything with salt in; his excuse is a dietary restriction, but actually he's the bandit chief, come in disguise to kill Ali Baba, and if he eats salt while he's a guest, he has "shared salt" with his host and is bound by the laws of hospitality. Ali Baba, suspecting nothing, orders food to be prepared without salt, but this makes his wise slave girl curious and leads to her unmasking the bandit.
</li><li> Sacred Hospitality killed the great hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Cuchulainn</a>. One of his geases prevented him from ever turning down hospitality; another forbade him from eating dog's flesh. When he stayed with an enemy (for reasons that made sense at the time), dinner that night was dog. The next day, stripped of his strength, Cuchulainn was killed in battle.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">among other things</a>, violating this rule. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">angels go in disguise</a> to test if anyone is willing to extend hospitality to them, but only Lot does so (to the point of protecting said angels from a mob of would-be rapists, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">offering up his own daughters instead</a>), and thus Lot and his family are spared while the rest of Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed.
</li><li> More happily, Abraham also has occasion to entertain the very same angels, who show up to tell him that, after some decades of trying, he and Sarai are finally going to have a kid.
</li><li> The above two cases inspire a line in the New Testament which expounds this trope:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Hebrews 13:2</strong> - Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelUnaware">angels unawares</a>.
</div></li><li> Jael, Heber's wife, subverted this: the Philistine general Sisera was fleeing after having been defeated by Deborah and her general Baraq, and Jael offered to shelter and hide him in her tent. After he was asleep, she drove a tent peg through his skull; she wasn't punished for breaking this "law" because Sisera was <strong>that</strong> dangerous.
</li><li> The Incident at Gibeah: a Levite, his concubine, and his servant stop for the night in Gibeah. One man welcomes them into his home, then the rest of the townsmen form a mob and demand to rape the Levite, who throws them his concubine instead. The men of Gibeah rape her to death, and this pits the rest of the tribes against the tribe of Benjamin. The author of Judges deliberately mirrors the story of Sodom and Gomorrah to say that the violation of sacred hospitality wasn't just a Canaanite problem.
</li><li> Found several times in the New Testament, as well: the most well-known example would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSamaritan">Good Samaritan</a>. There's also a passage in Matthew 10 where Jesus is sending his disciples out for their first hands-on missionary training: He tells them to take nothing with them but the clothes on their backs; any house that welcomes them is to be blessed, but for anyone who doesn't receive them "it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city." (The hospitality laws of the Jews were spelled out in Exodus, and were <em>really</em> important.)
<ul><li> Before the above (at least, found before the Luke telling of it), when He was on His way to Jerusalem, He sent messengers ahead to Samaria to prepare a place for Him, but they wouldn't receive Him because of His destination. James and John asked if He wanted them to command fire to come down and burn them up. (Jesus thought they were overreacting, and they just went to another village.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Hindu Mythology</a>, Yama arrived home to find that a man had been awaiting his arrival for three days. In atonement for this lack of hospitality, he granted the man three boons.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> story of the Green Giant. A green giant shows up in King Arthur's court and proclaims that he will let any knight cut off his head if he then pledges to have the same done to him in a year. Naturally, no one takes him up on the offer, so the giant calls them cowards, prompting Gawain to agree. Once the giant is decapitated, he picks up his head and rides off, telling Gawain he'll see him in a year. <br/>After Gawain sets off to honor the contract, he finds lodgings in a lord's house, where he and the lord make an agreement: the lord will go out hunting for the next three days, and they will exchange everything they obtained that day. <br/>The next morning, the lord's wife starts coming on to Gawain, but he refuses to accept anything but a kiss on the cheek, which he dutifully gives to the lord that evening. The same thing happens the next day, but the third day, the wife also gives him a magic belt, which he doesn't hand over. <br/>When Gawain goes to face the giant, he goes for Gawain's neck twice without hurting him, then gives him a nick on the third try, because of the belt he 'forgot' to mention. The giant is then revealed to be the lord and the whole thing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> for Gawain.

<ul><li> Both Aslan and Vilani in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a> have their own hospitality codes.
<ul><li> Some variations of the Aslan code come even before kin ties. One Aslan was praised for killing his brother in battle rather than turn against his host.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the three main customs (the others being Covenant and the Law of the Duel) holding the society of demons together in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum">Infernum</a></em>. Being a race almost entirely composed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">Neutral Evil</a> individuals, there's naturally a lot of wrangling over the fine details, such as whether hospitality extends solely to a demon's fortress or to anywhere on a demon's estates. In general, though, so long as a demon remembers to request hospitality (refusal of such a request reflects badly on the host-demon and its whole House), and makes no effort to attack its host, it is perfectly safe while in that fortress.

Normally in ven society, politics and backstabbing are just part of the fun - but if you request hospitality, and it's granted, what you're agreeing to is "no games." Your host won't plot against you, poison you, or look for ways to screw you over, you won't go prying into parts of the house where you shouldn't be in or otherwise screwing your host, and both sides are supposed to <em>mean it</em>.

<ul><li> The main charge against the Clan Campbell-led British army over the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Glencoe">Glencoe Massacre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the betrayal of the MacDonalds' hospitality by the billeted soldiers; a much- later inquiry found the Commander guilty of "Murder Under Trust".

</li><li> One of the traditions of the Passover seder is to leave an extra place setting (sometimes complete with food) on the table in case you're called upon to provide Sacred Hospitality to returning prophet Elijah.
</li><li> Hospitality is an important part of Slavic tradition when receiving guests. During a traditional Polish Christmas, a seat at the table is left open, in case there is anyone who needs a place to stay.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6hl0p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6hl0p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6hl0p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's also believed that nobody should be alone on Christmas.</span> Bread and salt also remain associated with hospitality in Slavic countries. While the actual practice of offering literal bread and salt is now reserved for formal and ceremonial occasions, the expression, "With bread and salt," is still used to mean, "With open arms."
</li><li> This is a common attitude among Western and Southern Asian peoples, especially in the Islamic world. There's a saying that goes something like "every guest is a gift from God", and this treatment is extended to everyone welcomed into the home, even enemies.
<ul><li> The Chinese are followers of this too; it's a social norm that in China, the host is obligated to ensure their guest(s)'s comfort, at their expense if need be.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islamic</a> cultures:
<ul><li> In many Arab societies that someone asking for a favor from a friend will say "we've eaten bread and salt together" as a way of indicating that he/she really needs it.
</li><li> Hospitality has long been recognized as a key part of Arab identity. This is likely on account of Arab culture's desert heritage: as nomadic herders, they needed to know that they could count on hospitality if they were in dire straits, and as settled merchants, hospitality was good for business (and also useful when traversing the trackless wastes with large amounts of valuable cargo).
</li><li> A soldier from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles">the Haganah</a> told a story of escaping captivity and running smack into an Arab commander. He handed her a piece of bread and told her to eat it; when she did so, he said "Now you are under my protection," and he fulfilled his word.
</li><li> A reporter during the Kosovo conflict once stayed at an Islamic home. One of the people living there was treated as well as he was, and at first, he considered him a relative of the owners. However, he also overheard this stranger being given ominous warnings that if he'd leave the house, he'd be killed...by the father. When the reporter asked for more details, he learned that this man was a guest in their house fifteen years before, and during a dispute killed the eldest son of the family. Under the peculiar local interpretation of custom and Sharia, this is punishable by death, but since he was a guest, he was still to be treated with respect. As such, he'd been living with this family quite happily since, and the family had gotten used to his presence to the point where many of them begged that he never leave, for his own sake.
</li><li> Similarly, out of <em>besa</em> (a very strong code of honor including hospitality rules), Muslim Albanians saved over 2,000 fleeing Jews during the Holocaust, passing them off (and treating them) as members of their own families, sometimes at the risk of their own lives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSumOfAllFears">The Sum of All Fears</a></em>, Jack Ryan quotes the Koran stating "If a man shall enter your tent and eat your salt, even though he be an infidel, you will protect him."
</li></ul></li><li> It used to be known for the poorer Bedouin to stay off the travel routes. If a guest arrived they would, of course, be obliged to give him a good greeting to make sure to keep Sacred Hospitality. So the only thing to do was to make sure very few guests arrived. Sort of a compromise between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor and Reason</a>.
</li><li> Related to this, there is in Arab culture the legend of the pre-Islamic Bedouin Christian poet Hatim al-Ta'iy, who killed his only possession — a she-goat — to feed some travelers who happened to stumble upon his tent. To this day, <em>karam Hatim</em> (the generosity of Hatim) is a fairly common (if somewhat high-class) expression for being <em>very</em> generous to one's guests.
</li><li> "Southern Hospitality" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetHomeAlabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetHomeAlabama">Sweet Home Alabama</a>, especially among the upper class. There are magazines about it and formal courses to take on it.
</li><li> Characteristic of the Benedictine monastic order, in fact one of their founding rules states that they should "always treat every visitor as if he was Jesus himself" because he might well be. They do have some liberty to decide how pleasant the visitors' stay will end up being, though. As just one example, should a guest be unpleasant, they may find themselves awakened at four in the morning because Jesus would want to be awake for the first prayers of the day; friendly guests, however, may be exempt, because if Jesus wants to talk to His dad He'll wake Himself up.
</li><li> Flora Macdonald, the Scottish Noblewoman who rescued Bonnie Prince Charlie.
</li><li> In the Church of Satan, the concept of Domain is mentioned as extremely important - if you are in someone else's Domain, you will show them proper respect or leave, and expect that they will return the favor in your Domain. On the other hand, it specifically says in the Satanic Bible that if your guests disrespect you, then you should destroy them. The sacred hospitality is two-sided: the guest has a code of behavior as well as the host, and if one breaks it, the other isn't obligated to go along, either.
</li><li> During the war in Afghanistan:
<ul><li> US Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell was injured in a firefight with the Taliban and limped his way to a nearby Afghan village. Luckily for him, this particular village was bound by tribal custom to defend visitors to the death, and they protected Luttrell from Taliban reprisals until he could be rescued.
</li><li> Less fortunately, the Pushtun tribal code prevented Mullah Omar from allowing the Saudis to extradite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OsamaBinLaden">Osama bin Laden</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>. When a US official called him to help, Omar said that he had offered the man his protection and so could do nothing. The US official replied that Bin Laden was like a guest who was shooting at the neighbors from the host's windows. Ultimately, of course, he hit something important, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">NATO blew the house to smithereens</a>, to continue the metaphor.
</li><li> In a more inspirational example, some aid workers came to an Afghan village to provide services. When Taliban troops came to kidnap said aid workers, the villagers fought tooth and nail to protect them, eventually driving the Taliban off. When asked why they had fought so hard against a superior foe, they replied that since the workers were there to help the village, the villagers were obligated to help them.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, it was not unusual for the Crusaders and the Arabs to sit down to meals together, in observance of Sacred Hospitality. The legend goes that Saladin was <em>very</em> demanding that his people observe these rules, such much that when one of his most trusted men attacked Saladin's guests, Saladin himself killed him and apologized profusely for the offense.
<ul><li> Some specific examples include Saladin sending snow, fruit, and his personal physician to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart">Richard the Lionheart</a> when he was ill and sending two of his personal horses to replace Richard's when it fell in battle. Equally chivalrous, Richard tried to arrange a marriage of his sister to Saladin's brother, with Jerusalem being a dowry open to all.
</li></ul></li><li> Anthropologists can trace this tradition back to gift economies, where people with a surplus had to give to their neighbors, otherwise resentment and jealousy would rip apart the pre-cash society. So it worked out like this:
<div class="indent"> Somebody with too much bronze: "Oh man, everyone's giving me the stink eye. I gotta get rid of this excess."
</div><div class="indent"> Somebody with not enough bronze: "Hey, your pile of bronze is looking great."
</div><div class="indent"> Somebody with too much bronze: "Oh this? It's nothing, please take some." (forces bronze into neighbor's hands)
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Later that day</em>: "Hey, that pile of baskets is looking great." And so on...
</div></li><li> Just about every society takes the rules of Sacred Hospitality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">seriously</a>, even in the Modern Age. While societies with more modern infrastructure may be asked to observe it less often than in the past, violating these often unspoken rules is a major social offense. Some have the rule that you are not required to let them in your home, but if you do, then you better observe these rules, as should the invitee.
</li><li> In the medieval era there was a huge list of strict rules around this. They were actually vitally necessary as any kind of travel (especially if it was a huge entourage) took a lot of time and the only options were to board up with someone or bed down on the side of the road. If you broke the rules of hospitality on either end you could face barred doors the next time you knocked. Some of the rules even persist today, like "Taking It Outside". Way back when it was entirely possible for two people who were feuding to wind up staying at the same man's house. It would be rude to start fighting within his walls, possibly damaging his property, so if they started butting heads they had to walk outside of the walls before swords were drawn.
</li><li> A couple of curious examples were the relation between a noble and a high-class prisoner of war or hostage. While the latter was there by force, the laws of war and diplomacy dictated that they treat each other as host and guest. Often this would extend to the guest fighting in the host's army and several famous warlords won their spurs as a hostage in a foreign court. The system of honorable hostage exchange was an obvious tool of family-dominated politics and became obsolete with it. However, some traces of Sacred Hospitality toward prisoners of war remained as late as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, an example of which was General <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernardLawMontgomery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernardLawMontgomery">Montgomery</a>'s controversial act of inviting a captured German general to dinner (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> said, "my sympathies are entirely with the German" for having to dine with Monty).
</li><li> In pre-Revolution America, some smaller Colonial settlements had a custom of leaving one or more candles burning in the window as a sign that one's home was open to wandering travelers. There was no rule that said you had to give room and board to a traveler, though you would face social stigma if you had the extra room and refused to offer it. Supposedly the number of candles in the window symbolized what kind of welcome the house was willing to offer. One candle meant "you can spend the night in the barn", two candles meant "we have an extra bed", and three candles meant "we have an extra bed and hot food". (A popular joke has it that a fourth candle, especially one shining from an upstairs window, signified that the farmer's daughter would sleep with you.) This practice started to peter out during the lead-up to the American Revolution when the political loyalties of travelers became a cause for concern. Harboring a Loyalist in a Patriot-friendly village (or vice-versa) could cause your neighbors to turn on you.
<ul><li> A symbolic version of this still continues year-round (not just around Christmas, like people often assume) in many northern states, specifically the old Colonial states of the Northeast. If you drive through the countryside or even some urban and suburban neighborhoods in this region, there's a pretty good chance that you'll see several homes with candles burning in their windows. All of them will be decorative and electric, of course, but it's still considered a traditional gesture of welcome and guidance to friends and travelers in many northeastern communities.
</li></ul></li><li> The old Celtic celebration that would later go on to be commercialized into Halloween was an extension of Sacred Hospitality, where people would go from home to home and receive food from their neighbors, failure to satisfy at least one group would be allowance for some pretty harsh (some myths say deadly) pranks and tricks. Since the purpose of the holiday was to scare or appease <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, the tricks were something annoyed Fae would be prone to do if they got snubbed, so it served as a warning to the inhospitable family that they were endangering the entire township by being so stingy.
</li><li> Very much a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> in the Indian Subcontinent. Unlike much of the developed world, travel is still somewhat difficult in the nations of the subcontinent - and a long tradition of Sacred Hospitality persists.
<ul><li> Sikhism has a variant of this as a religious requirement. At a Sikh temple, there is (usually) an attached Community Kitchen (called <em>Langar</em>) where anyone may show up and get a free meal, regardless of background. No questions asked. In almost all areas, these meals are strictly vegetarian (save for certain days each year which vary per temple) so that everyone may eat as equals. Rural Sikhs in Punjab and the surrounding areas may also offer more traditional sacred hospitality, but this is more likely to be culturally inspired than religiously inspired.
</li><li> Hindus believe that a stranger could very well be one of the Gods themselves, and are expected to treat them well. Breaking the tradition is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">one of the worst sins someone could ever commit.</a> Much like the Sikhs, most Hindu temples also have a Community Kitchen (called <em>Choultry</em> or <em>Dharamshaala</em>) where people will be given meals (strictly vegetarian, naturally) and boarding, no questions asked.
</li></ul></li><li> For most nomadic people, Sacred Hospitality is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>. This was doubly true for Temujin, later known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>, whose father had been murdered when someone chose to break it by poisoning him, and several of his later troubles stemmed from failures to uphold the tradition, as well. How serious was this to him? Seriously enough that he <em>completely annihilated</em> several larger nations over it.
<ul><li> The most infamous, and perhaps most important, of these invasions was that of the Khwarizmi. Inalchuq, governor of the Central Asian city of Otrar for the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarazmian_dynasty">Khwarezmian Empire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, once decided to break Sacred Hospitality and arrest a trade embassy sent by the Mongol that had rested in his city under the baseless assumption that there might be spies among them and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheMessenger">executed them</a> while reselling their goods. When Genghis Khan heard of what had happened, he was not happy. Otrar was later overtaken by the Mongols and Inalchuq got publicly executed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">getting molten silver poured on his eyes, ears, and down his throat</a>. Genghis Khan was a particular sticker for this concept, and violating it as the Khwarezmians did was one of the best ways to piss him off. And when Genghis is pissed off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">he kills so many of your people that the difference affects the carbon levels of the atmosphere</a>.
</li><li> Similar slights featured in later Mongol conquests, including that of China by his grandsons Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan.
</li></ul></li><li> Curiously, the destruction of the Khwarezmians was not the first time that a Persian ruler had started a war by failing to respect an embassy from a nomadic steppe empire. Some six centuries earlier (in 588 CE), a Sassanid governor (satrap) rejected trade negotiations from the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G&lt;!--C3--&gt;B6kt&lt;!--C3--&gt;BCrks">Göktürks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7or4u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7or4u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7or4u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The Göktürks are thought to have been an offshoot of the later <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu">Xiongnu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, being survivors of the collapse of the Juqu circa 450 CE. Another steppe empire, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouran_Khaganate">Rouran Khaganate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, had enslaved them at that time, but were overthrown by a Göktürk revolt around 550 CE.</span>, turning the first embassy away and destroying their goods, then killing the second group of envoys outright. The Western Göktürks, who had aided the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sassanid Persians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in destroying the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephthalites">Hephtalites<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> only a few years earlier, would ally themselves with Persia's perennial enemy the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire shortly afterwards. While they never did anything like the damage done by the Mongols, they would remain a thorn in the Persians side up for the next fifty years, until Persia was conquered by the emerging <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Nowadays, this has even been commercialized in the form of Airbnb. Although there is a financial transaction involved, many Airbnb listings are in essence a high-tech version of the old "candle in the window". And without hosts and guests treating each other respectfully, the business would quickly fall apart.
</li><li> Studies into travel have shown that "visiting friends &amp; family" has gotten increasing market share as a reason to travel over "business" and "pleasure". With the increasingly open borders in Europe and the high mobility of people in the Anglosphere, it's more than likely that a weary traveler will arrive after a day or more on the rails or road or in the air when they finally see their old Erasmus buddy or distant cousin, so a set of (unwritten) rules to go by is not the worst idea.
</li><li> Some travel guides to Russia say that guests should be very careful about compliments when visiting Russian homes and keep their comments in general terms. This is because under Russian customs and traditions of hospitality if a guest says something positive about an item in a home, the host will take it as an obligation to give that item to the guest as a gift.
</li><li> Japan has their own term for this: Omotenashi which, roughly translated, means "hide nothing", with the implication being that your every action should be a reflection of your true feelings. In practice, this means that hospitality in Japan is serious business, as hosts believe that their guests being anything less than completely happy with the experience represents a personal and professional failing. At some of the more traditional Ryokan (Japanese inns), the staff of the inn will wait out front when you arrive to greet you as you come in and will similarly see you off when you leave, waving until you/your car is out of sight.
