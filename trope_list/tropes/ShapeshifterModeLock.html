If they use up 80% of their Youki power, they fully turn into a Youma and cannot transform back into human form and hunter will become the hunted (apart from some rare exceptions).

Eventually this aspect was downplayed, since they spent some 20 episodes in the Digital World, and after that the Digimon's existence was known by the public.
</li><li> One chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em> had Dark in control of the body after Daisuke went missing (sort of) on White Day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>
<ul><li> In the early part of the Cell saga, Freeza can only stay in his final form, due to his mechanical parts from being severely injured during his fight with Goku.
</li><li> In the Buu Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, the Old Kai warns Goku that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fusing</a> via the Potara earrings while in Super Saiyan form will lead to the fusion being unable to power down, when Super Saiyan can normally be activated and deactivated at will. On top of that, the strain that Super Saiyan puts on the body could prove lethal.
</li><li> This point comes up later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Future Zamasu</span> and Goku Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fuse into</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fusion Zamasu</span> using the earrings.

This does come with some downsides, though; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Fusion Zamasu is hit with enough energy, half of his body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">starts mutating</a>, since his immortality didn't fully extend to his mortal half, and thus can't fix the damage like it would for Future Zamasu.</span>

Since alchemy doesn't work in our world, he remains stuck in his dragon form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimeChanNoRibon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimeChanNoRibon">Hime-chan no Ribon</a></em> has Hime-chan stuck in the form of her rival, Hibino. After being hit by a truck and revived, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">she got better</a>.
</li><li> Akko-chan, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimitsuNoAkkoChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimitsuNoAkkoChan">Himitsu no Akko-chan</a></em>, usually had to use the mirror to switch back as well, causing problems when she would temporarily misplace it.
<ul><li> In one episode of the original 1969 series, aptly named "_____", Akko-chan, upon meeting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">new deaf kid</a>, uses her mirror, out of curiosity and compassion, to transform herself in a deaf-mute version of herself. Too bad that, since the mirror works by clear utterances of the needed transformation, and since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Akko-chan insisted on the "mute" part of her ailment</a>, Akko-chan couldn't ask the mirror to be changed back anymore.
<ul><li> Apparently, the mirror could have hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> all the times, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since it believed Akko-chan's desire for deafness shallow and impulsive, had decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">show her how serious is an handicap</a> by threatening Akko-chan with a permanent mode-lock</span>, with the added perk to show how badly she was missing the point: instead of trying to feel on a temporary basis what deafness is, she should have rather stopped at how her new friend was going on even knowing that he couldn't get a magic mirror to fix him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This happens to the Macross in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Macross: Do You Remember Love?</a></em>: when a Meltrandi attack blows off its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalMechaFins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalMechaFins">Vertical Mecha Fins</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Macross</a> is locked into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> mode since those fins, aside from being its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, also happen to be the ship mode's forward section. And indeed after the final battle of both the movie and the series, the Macross never transforms into ship mode ever again as it's stuck waist down in a lake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarvelousMelmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarvelousMelmo">Marvelous Melmo</a></em> has two chief examples of this trope. Melmo, the titular heroine, is gifted by her dead mother with two types of candies. The blue candies make her older, and the red ones make her younger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">with the explicit purpose of making her able to care for her younger siblings</a>. As early as the first episodes, Melmo discovers that by taking both pills at once, she can de-age herself to embryonic state, then regrow her body in another form, thus shapeshifting to another animal.
<ul><li> When his little brother Totoo tries that for himself, he turns himself into a frog, spending half the series figuring how to swallow a couple of pills that now are bigger than his own stomach.
</li><li> When the angels responsible for Melmo's empowering decide that she's abusing it, by continuously aging and shapeshifting for personal reasons, they withhold their blessing from the candies. However, at the very same moment, Melmo is currently transformed into a dog, so, without her candies, she's stuck in that form, and unable to care for her little brothers. Upon getting her Aesop, she's turned back, but this time with a limited supply of candies.
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>. Ilulu is fully capable of assuming her true form as well as changing her human guise, but she isn't very good at finer control of her shapeshifting, so she ends up looking like a petite girl with ridiculous breasts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars">Pointed Ears</a>, and dragon claws, which is the best she can manage (though she improves enough to form proper hands later on). Tohru states that if she relaxes her control her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Gag Boobs</a> would get bigger, but would presumably end up with more inhuman features in turn. Thus, she basically has to stay the way she is now to fit in until she can get better control of her shape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> The goal of the cursed characters is to be cursed again in the Spring of the Drowned Man or Drowned Girl. That way, when splashed with cold water, they'll turn into themselves, effectively not changing. Aside from that, the more common disadvantageous type of Mode Lock appears a few times as well:
</li><li> In an early story, Ranma was the victim of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint">Pressure Point</a> attack called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Full Body Cat's Tongue</a>, which made him unable to bear hot water — the trigger to turn him male — thereby locking him into his girl mode until the cure was found. In at least the anime version, this resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistedKneeCollapse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistedKneeCollapse">Twisted-Knee Collapse</a> once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Cologne</a> told him about it, and vowed he would be cured if only he agreed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">honor his engagement</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl">Shampoo</a>.
</li><li> A sort of <em>de facto</em> mode lock occurs when Ranma pretends to be Picolet de Chardin's fiancee. Girl Ranma is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyCostume">locked into</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetHurts">tight corset</a> made of <em>steel</em>, which is too tight for him to breathe in if he changes to his larger male form.
</li><li> In the manga's Musk Dynasty arc, Herb has the same curse as Ranma and has been locked into cursed form by the water from a magical pail. He comes to Japan looking for the cure, is angered when Ranma discovers his changed body, and uses the pail on Ranma as well. Mousse and Ryoga go with Ranma planning to use it on themselves while in human form to effectively remove the curse, but since it works by splashing you with cold water, you'll always be in cursed form when the Mode Lock take effect.
</li><li> Ranma also briefly had a temporary cure when he got a fever so hot it made any water he came in contact with too warm to activate the curse. Conversely, when he got a freezing cold later in the same story, the moisture in the air flash-froze in contact with him, which <em>also</em> made it impossible to turn into a girl (since solid ice doesn't trigger the curse).
</li><li> In the second movie, <em>Nihao My Concubine</em>, the villain has waters from a sacred spring that transformed the one splashed in it permanently into a man. He uses it to threaten girls to come along quietly with him, but the curse spring victims try to use it to break their curse. By the end of the movie, Ranma's falling high speed toward the spring, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he has Akane falling with him, so he destroys the spring so she doesn't get stuck as a man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">ruining his chance to break the curse once again.</a> </span>

<ul><li> A memorable example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> came when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> sent a shapeshifting demon to kill Elaine. The demon in question killed her father and took his form to get close to her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Elaine escaped, the Big Bad decided to stop said demon from interfering by trapping it in that form permanently.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:

</li><li> Courier's not the only X-character to suffer this. Nearly any character with a civilian form and a combat form will find him/herself stuck in powered-up mode. Colossus has been trapped in metal form, Iceman in ice form, Lifeguard in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half Shi'ar form</a>, Shadowcat as intangible (not shapeshifter but worth mention), Wolfsbane as at least part wolf, and so on.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a></em> graphic novel. Jennifer is told by Reed Richards that he has bad news: She's stuck as She-Hulk forever and can never change back into regular human Jennifer. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatPanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatPanel">Beat Panel</a>, She-Hulk inquired "So what's this bad news"? It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">turned out</a> that Reed was lying anyway since he's a dick.
</li><li> Averted in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WildCATs">Wild CA Ts</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLA">JLA</a></em> crossover where Maul is afraid to use his power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">exchange intelligence for size</a> because he would become "too stupid to turn back" if he grew big enough to smash the villain's barrier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Superman</a> solves it by giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">an electric spark that turns him small after 30 seconds</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Skrull</a> named Khn'nr was to be used in the infiltration of Earth in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel's</a> Secret Invasion event. He was mode locked into the form of Captain Marvel, a long dead hero, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">brainwashed into thinking he was him</a> from the past. When he found out, he rejected his part in the invasion, and now is trying to work against it.
<ul><li> Similarly, quite a few Skrulls who took the form of Dr. Hank Pym wound up losing themselves in the role/being overwhelmed by the personality of the original, and had to be put down.
<ul><li> During the period when the entire Skrull race lost their powers, they were stuck in whatever form they took at the time. Those whose jobs involved snaking through drainpipes, for example, had to be cut out. The villain who actually initiated the change was in a suit that he thought would protect him from the effect. It did not, leaving him permanently trapped inside, in agony because the "suit" was not hollow, but loaded with internal machinery that he had oozed around and between.
</li><li> In another example, some Skrulls who invaded Earth were brainwashed into becoming cows, rendering them harmless. Unfortunately, the cows were then slaughtered, and those who ate the meat either died or gained powers along with a virus. That's the origin of the Skrull Kill Krew. Team member Riot was stuck in a monstrous bug form for an extended period of time.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, a story arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a></em> involved him being Mode Locked in a form resembling his usual appearance, but with four arms. This was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the four-armed Green Martians in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">Barsoom</a></em> novels.

</li><li> The evil White Martians are initially dealt with this way by the JLA. They are given human form and have their memories removed, effectively trapping them as humans. Needless to say, problems occur when a few of them get their minds back and remember how to shapeshift.

<ul><li> Likewise, the Dinobots, who took their alt-modes to avoid succumbing to energon-poisoning. However, due to circumstances, they become unable to ditch these afterwards. Grimlock tries, and the most he can do is make a few cosmetic changes. By the time they get a chance to change them, they've all decided they like turning into dinosaurs.
</li><li> There's a device from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Marvel G1 series</a> that locks a Transformer in one mode. It's used on Blaster for defying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">Grimlock</a>. It's more than an inconvenience for Blaster (or Soundwave, for that matter) because of their alternate modes: not-terribly-mobile radios. It later gets used to mode-lock the Combaticon Blast-Off in his space shuttle mode in order to take a bunch of human kids for an orbital joyride.
</li><li> Toward the end of the Marvel run, Grimlock searches for a legendary energy source, Nucleon, to revive several fallen Autobots for the upcoming battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Unicron</a>. After the battle, he froze up, his body reforming into a new Action Master form - one which couldn't transform (see the Toys entry below for more). Other Autobots weren't immediately affected; in the IDW follow-up series <em>Regeneration One</em>, we learn that some of the revived Autobots had unpredictable, dangerous side-effects, and Grimlock set out on a quest to find a cure, which set the second story arc in motion.

Whether this is good or bad depends on the form he's stuck as. Hulk would love to be mode-locked and never turn into Banner again. Banner would love to be free of the Hulk, but at this point knows better. Both absolutely hate the idea of being mode-locked as the other.
<ul><li> Unlike the Hulk, the Abomination is completely incapable of returning to his original human form. He's none too happy about that.

<ul><li> "Yennorks" are werewolves born with permanent mode-lock. Angua had a sister Elsa who was unable to turn into a wolf and her brother Andrei passes himself off as a sheepdog because of his inability to take human form. She makes it clear to Carrot that this doesn't make them a human and a wolf, they're both still werewolves, just werewolves unable to change.
<ul><li> Also used more conventionally within the series: Angua frequently worries about the psychological effects of becoming a wolf, fearing that if she stays in wolf form too long, she will forget how to be human.
</li><li> Shown with her father, in particular, who is slowly forgetting how to be human. Mentioned also that the human/reasoning side becomes less powerful the longer they're in Werewolf form, while the senses fade in human form.
</li><li> Angua herself is locked into her wolf form and unable to return to human form when a wily adversary gets a silver collar onto her.
</li></ul></li><li> Borrowing can also cause this, in a way; if a witch borrows an animal's mind and stays there for too long, she'll forget she was ever human and it'll take a powerful witch to bring her back.
</li></ul></li><li> An unusual variation occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Switchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Switchers">Switchers</a></em> series.

This issue is directly and pointedly addressed in the second book, appropriately entitled <em>Midnight's Choice</em>.
</li><li> Likewise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em>, Daemons may manifest as any creature up until (once again) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">their human counterpart grows up</a>, whereupon they "settle" on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">highly symbolic</a> permanant form.
</li><li> Several people in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KieshaRa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KieshaRa">Kiesha'ra</a></em> series by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes have had their animal forms "bound" so that they can't transform, some intentionally as punishment. It's not a pleasant process.
<ul><li> Though none have appeared in published canon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that a shapeshifter who spends an extremely long period of time in his or her animal form can get modelocked as the animal.

A strange black hawk turns out to be a powerful mage after being given enough drugs to knock out a human - he was so sick in animal form that there was no way he could do anything, much less change back. Daine also gains the ability to shapeshift later on, but often can't shift back if she panics or forgets about her human self. Also, if she ever shapeshifted into an immortal, she would be unable to change back.
</li><li> This is a subplot of a Polish story "Academy of Pan Kleks".

</li><li> This also happens to Tonks although it's not too dramatic. Tonks is unable to use her metamorphmagus skills when she becomes depressed about her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">love for Remus Lupin</span> and thus gets stuck <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">looking rather like a girl version of him</span>.

Georgina is lucky enough to be in her default form when the lock begins — another succubus is not so lucky and gets locked into a completely different body.

One day she met a wizard who cursed her to remain in wolf form permanently until she could repent for her evil ways.

<ul><li> When the elves, most of which were the slaves of the giants, rebelled, the Gyrderi, who were the free elves, decided to help their kin.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Rage</em> (the card game based off of <em>Werewolf: the Apocalypse</em>), Tamara Lovegrove of the Seventh Generation can lock Garou into their current form as her special ability.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> itself, there are a few ways it can come up:
<ul><li> Werewolves and other shapeshifters can "lose the wolf," permanently losing their Rage and becoming trapped in their birth-form, if they suffer too severely from depression.
</li><li> There was once a gift that let a werewolf stay in Crinos war-form (used either for major battles or as punishment), but it's been long lost.
</li><li> One variant that only kicks in upon death is a rite that locks a dead metis' corpse into either Homid or Lupus form instead of the Crinos form that a dead metis would normally take, done to preserve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>.
</li><li> One particularly creepy one comes from when a shifter is possessed by a Weaver spirit and turned into a drone. Since the Weaver is all about calcified, unchanging "perfection," its drones cannot change at all - for shifters, this includes never being able to change into their other forms. This (combined being possessed by a spirit that works for an insane embodiment of pure order) invariably drives the shifter insane. The Weaver fortunately is loathe to do this, however, as it recognizes that its shapeshifting allies are more useful with that ability intact in most cases.
</li><li> A particular vulnerability of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">Rokea</a> shifters is born of their link to the sea. Even if they find or possess other means of maintaining their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Gnosis</a> when they go too long without immersion in seawater or something close to it they are locked into whatever form they are in when the clock runs out <em>forever</em>, as one NPC operating in the upper reaches of the Amazon basin found out the hard way.

Werewolves normally transform back and forth between their human and wolf form depending on the amount of spells cast on the last turn, and their human forms are typically much weaker. As long as Immerwolf is on the battlefield, all werewolves already in wolf form are locked into it, making them far more formidable (werewolves in human form remain free to shapeshift into beast form, but not out of it).
<ul><li> A corollary is the Planeswalker Arlinn Kord, herself a werewolf native to Innistrad. She changes between human and wolf form, but only beneath the light of Innistrad's moon. She can Planeswalk to other worlds in either form, but is Mode Locked until she returns to Innistrad.

A Land-Air 'Mech that takes either a gyro hit or an actuator hit is as good as stuck in whichever form it's in at the moment.

Most Princesses are standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero">Henshin Hero</a> fare: they default to a human form, can temporarily assume a powerful magical form, and must concentrate and make an effort to hold that form for long stretches of time. Princessess of Mirrors, on the other hand, default to their <em>magical</em> form and have to make an effort to assume or stay in their <em>human</em> shape.

<ul><li> A variant with the <em>idigam</em>. These spirits start out as Formless, ever-shifting creatures of chaos whose weaknesses change from scene to scene. Once they choose something by which to define themselves they Coalesce, locking themselves into a specific shape and powerset, with the cost of also giving themselves a permanent Ban and Bane. They <em>can</em> revert to Formlessness, but it requires considerable effort and few are willing to lose the powers of their Coalesced form.

The toy was capable of working without it, but the partner made it a tad easier — not to mention the toys looked better with the partner attached).
<ul><li> More severe were the Action Masters, a series of <em>non-transforming</em> Transformer toys, stuck in their robot modes. The fluff explained that they had taken a substance called Nucleon, that had rendered them more powerful, more 'alive', but robbed them of their ability to transform into vehicles. To compensate for this, the Action Masters were all packaged with transformable <em>accessories</em>, such as weapons or vehicles.

<ul><li> Certain units can shapeshift, but the action is considered to be a spell, and costs mana (and sometimes also has a cool down). So, if a Dark Ranger casts Silence on a bunch of Druids of the Claw, then, well, no Bear Form for you. Similar things can be done with Druids of the Talon and Spirit Walkers.
</li><li> A TFT walkthrough states that in one mission, hitting Ilidan with a bunch of damaging spells will have a high chance of distrupting his AI, preventing him from transforming into his demonic form when heavily injured.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The black dragon boss Nefarian has calls out to specific classes with specific effects on those classes. The class call to Druids ("Druids and their silly shapeshifting. Let's see it in action!") will force all Druids to shapeshift into cat form and block them in it for a while. Feral specialized DPS druids may not be affected if they're fighting in this form anyway, but druid bear tanks, healers and spellcasters will be annoyed. Of course, at the time Nefarian was at the top of the food chain DPS-specced feral druids, and for that matter any non-healer druids, were so exceedingly rare in end-game raiding that Nefarian was probably fine discounting their existence entirely.
</li><li> A slightly less obvious example existed for Warriors in the same fight. Warriors, while not traditional shapeshifters, do have the ability to switch between different stances. When Nef called them out, "Warriors, is that all the damage you can do?", they were forced into Berserker Stance — which increases damage done but also decreases defenses. Like the above druids, at this point in the game 99.99% of raid tanks were Warriors and virtually all raiding Warriors were expected to at least be geared for tanking for trash and should a boss require multiple offtanks or should the shit hit the fan. This meant that when Warriors were called the tank suddenly took A LOT more damage, and it was time to blow defensive cooldowns and heal bomb. The entirety of phase 2 of that fight was built around messing with a class's ability to do its (at the time) primary job.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> example, in <em>Legion</em>'s version of Dalaran in the first aid shop, you find a druid trapped in his aquatic form (a sea lion) stuck in a bathtub complete with showerhead and frilly curtains. If you ask him about it he tells you he was doing reconnaissance in the waters off the broken shore and got clobbered by an infernal dropping from the sky, and it's risky to shift back until he's completely healed. The entire situation has him thoroughly embarrassed and he asks you to not tell anyone he knows about it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em>, this is the default setting for transformations. Whenever a card transforms, whether by its own power or other cards' effect, the card will remain as its transformed state for the rest of the match. For example, if you play your <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Molten_Blade">Molten Blade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that has transformed into <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arcanite_Reaper">Arcanite Reaper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, once the Reaper breaks, your <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Rummaging_Kobold">Rummaging Kobold<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can only fetch back your Reaper, not your Molten Blade.

In <em>Beast Wars</em>, it was that all of the robots would be debilitated by energon radiation and that organic-skinned beast modes would protect them (an excuse as good as obsolete by the second season, but by then everyone had vehicle modes that gave them the advantage of speed or flight anyway). In at least one instance, having serious damage to the robot body prompted the internal system to force a Transformer back into Beast Mode. <em>Beast Machines</em> had the Maximals stuck in beast mode until they learned how to use their new techno-organic bodies, and had to use their alternate forms to hide from the ubiquitous wardrones.
<ul><li> There was also an episode where Megatron has a beam-like device that trapped characters hit with it in Beast Mode. This lost the Maximals a chance to contact Cybertron.
</li><li> The original Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> comics introduced Nucleon late in the run, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">tie in with the toy line's introduction of the non-transforming Action Masters</a>. Nucleon strengthens a Transformer immensely, but, among other nasty potential side effects, always renders them unable to transform. Understandably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">most users wind up wishing they'd never touched the stuff.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> cartoon, specifically the episode "The Autobot Run" had the Transfixatron, a weapon that trapped most of the Autobots in their vehicle modes (all land-based, all unarmed), making them very vulnerable to the Decepticons. Later episodes would imply that Mode Lock could also be the result of heavy damage, and the Headmasters were automatically stuck in vehicle mode anytime their partners (who transformed into their heads) weren't around.
<ul><li> Also in "Desertion of the Dinobots", a little bit of Phlebotinum called "Cybertonium", which all Cybertron-created Transformers (i.e.: not the Dinobots) need in order to function correctly, starts decaying, resulting in semi-hilarious malfunctions (Megatron in at one point waving his arms around wildly when trying to fly, Ironhide icing himself up). Jazz is shown as unable to transform from car mode (until Ironhide kicks him), and is later shown stuck part-transformed (robot upper body, still in car mode in lower body). During the episode, Perceptor actually says "Fortunately I am still stuck in microscope mode").
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Beast Wars</em> example is a double-edged sword: by remaining in beast mode for <em>too</em> long, the beast instincts start to overwhelm the robot intelligence until they become feral. Certain Maximals who frequently remain in beast mode, notably Tigatron, are able to overcome this.
<ul><li> After even the normal Maximals were forced into permanent Beast Mode for an episode, they too learned the trick, and proceeded to teach the Predacons a lesson in Beast Wars.
</li></ul></li><li> Yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> example: Optimus Primal became mode-locked in "Gorilla Warfare" thanks to Scorponok frakking around with his cyber-bee.

</li><li> In another episode, "The Frogs of War", Ben uses the mode lock to keep him as a member of the species that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">invaded the earth and exiled him</span>. It's notable that this example the audience is unaware until shortly before he removes the lock.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Visionaries">Visionaries</a></em> has few examples of this:
<ul><li> In "Lion Hunt", Darkstorm uses a potion to trap Leoric in his Lion form. Unless the spell is broken by the setting of the Three Suns, Leoric will never be able to revert to human form again.
</li><li> In "Horn of Unicorn, Claw of Dragon", Arzon, after he has developed symptoms of the Magical Plague, attempts to assume his Eagle form, only to find that he can't maintain it, effectively trapping him in human form.
</li><li> In "The Trail of Three Wizards", most of the Visionaries become exhibits in a magical zoo, where they are locked into their animal forms.
</li><li> In "Dawn of the Sun Imps", one of the titular Imps (who has the ability to control felines) takes control of Leoric, who becomes trapped in his Lion form as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMask">The Mask</a>: The Animated Series</em> featured a gypsy fortune-teller that tricked Stanley into giving her the Mask which she then used to power another magic Mask that gives enormous powers. She then discards the Mask thinking it's now useless and Stanley puts it on... only The Mask is stuck in the form of a stereotypical Scot (complete with kilt). He then gradually obtains the rest of his forms (starting with the most useless ones, as The Mask himself lampshades).
</li><li> This is the entire purpose of the Plasmius Maximus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>. It has been used on both Danny and Vlad, modelocking them into their human forms. Other weapons/containment devices have this as a side effect of sorts.
<ul><li> Don't forget the episode "Forever Phantom", in which one of Jack's weapons zaps Danny and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank">Amorpho</a>, forcing the former to stay in his ghost form and the latter to stay in Danny's human form...even though Amorpho still manages to (with difficulty) shift a bit more before being cured. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory">It's a Long Story</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Between episodes 21 and 23 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>, Adamaï, a young shapeshifting dragon, is stuck in Tofu form after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatHim">swallowed whole and then regurgitated</a> by Igôle (a powerful beast reinforced by Xelor magic, which is what interfere with Adamaï's power). This is a case where the modelocked form is small and weak, Tofus being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> birds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Puck is mode-locked into one shape, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that of Owen Burnett</span>, by Oberon after rebelling against his king. Given that shapeshifting is a major part of Puck's tricks... this sucks. The punishment also included eternal banishment from their homeland Avalon. Puck wanted to spend more time living as a human in the human world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">and Oberon gave it to him.</a> The only way he can get mode-unlocked is to train or protect Xanatos's son, Alexander.
</li><li> The Gargoyle's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">stone-sleep</a> is a variant of this, being a unique aspect of their physiology. The curse took advantage of this by mode-locking them in it for over a millennia, preventing them from reawakening when the sun set each day.
</li></ul></li><li> Meatwad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em> practiced turning into a life sized figure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">he can normally only become a hotdog and igloo</a>) only to get stuck that way for the rest of the episode, as if he pulled a muscle.
</li><li> Timber Wolf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperheroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperheroes">Legion Of Superheroes</a></em> is mode locked into his half-human, half-feral form because his father tampered with his DNA too much.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs">Supernoobs</a></em>, if Kevin doesn't use his Battle Ball to turn back into a human within three hours, his DNA will permanently change and he will spend the rest of his life as his current animal form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina">Vampirina</a></em>: Vampires get stuck in their bat forms as a symptom of batty fever.
</li><li> The episode "Good Hunting" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a></em> features this prominently. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">The Magic Goes Away</a>, the shapeshifter Yen finds it harder and harder to leave human form, eventually becoming locked in it. After her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Unwilling Roboticisation</a>, she finds an alternate way to escape this trope. And her species by default has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a> that can shape-lock them, at least until they dry off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts">Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</a></em> has this as the danger of undergoing full, rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Partialtransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Partialtransformation">partial</a> transformation, as the shifter can lose themselves to their animal half without external stimulus to remind them of their human side. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This ended up being the case for Kipo's mother, Song.</span>
