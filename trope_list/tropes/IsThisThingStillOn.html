<ul><li> In "Calvin Brain", Brain's latest plan for world domination is undone when a behind-the-scenes documentary crew films him unleashing a diatribe on the shallowness of the fashion industry and the brainlessness of those who follow its dicates. His last words on the video are even "Is that thing on?".

This happens so often in politics across the world, politicians are often told to heed the mantra "Every microphone is live". It's since been expanded to include "There's always a camera, even when there isn't". Essentially, politicians are advised never to say or do anything in public that might get them in trouble, no matter what. But that hasn't stopped people from screwing up...

</li><li> Then there was the time when Bush had a press conference with some US troops in Iraq, a PR event advertised as the President's chance to have a "frank, spontaneous conversation" with the soldiers. Problem was, a news channel picked up a live feed of the conference room before the event showing a full-blown <em>rehearsal</em> with every question and cute one-liner laid out in advance.

</li><li> On the other hand, the famed "Now watch this drive" is <em>not</em> an example of this trope, as he knew full well the cameras were still on him. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">Facepalm</a> moment for sure, but not this trope.

He said "Holy shit, two garbagemen wishing happiness... (sic) (...) two damn garbagemen... one of the most worthless employments" while the microphone was still on. Following that, he was indicted for moral damages and was indemnified by the Court of Justice to pay R$60,000 to the men he attacked. He then apologized for that in another broadcast.
</li><li> Jesse Jackson was caught on mike whispering, "I wanna cut his nuts off," referring to Barack Obama. Made further hilarious by the jerking motion he made, as though motioning just how he would perform this castration. (Didn't stop him from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">weeping profusely</a> in Grant Park the night Obama was elected.)

</li><li> While attending a course during his time posted to Egypt, then-Lieutenant Charles Hazlitt Upham (later winner of TWO Victoria Crosses) once looked out into a briefing-theatre full of generals and muttered, "My oath — what a galaxy of bloody talent!"... not realising he was standing next to a live microphone.

Bush on the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, CNN anchor Kyra Phillips <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp7QhEeQF_o">visited the bathroom, leaving her mike on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Parts of a personal conversation between Phillips and a colleague — criticizing her sister-in-law and giving advice on men — were broadcast live as though it were color commentary. How this was not noticed by a sound engineer before Kyra returned to the studio is unknown.

</li><li> In July 2009 Michael Duvall, a California state assemblyman, was captured on tape describing to a colleague — in graphic detail — his ongoing extramarital affairs with two different women, one of whom turned out to be a lobbyist for a company in a sector (energy) that Duvall's legislative committee was in charge of overseeing. The tape in question was eventually aired by a TV station, prompting Duvall's eventual resignation.

</li><li> During the eighties and early nineties it was very common for US TV networks to transmit satellite feeds without any form of scrambling or encryption so anyone with a satellite dish and satellite TV tuner could view them. Because of this it was possible for people to watch (and record) satellite interviews as they were being conducted. For live broadcasts, the feed was usually setup far before the interview began and when the network cut to commercial or another segment of the program the satellite feed usually stayed on leading to many real-life instances of this trope. Several of them were collected in a documentary called <em>Spin</em>
</li><li> News anchor Sue Simmons, displeased with some off-camera incident, unleashes a hilarious <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETnp8Tq3CFw">bit of profanity.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> She later apologized, but David Letterman still had a tremendous amount of fun at her expense.

</li><li> At the end of an interview, having thought that the broadcast had ceased, Mel Gibson added a little something to the end of his farewell to the interviewer <a class="urllink" href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/1008066/mel-gibson-denies-abusing-reporter-on-live-tv">he probably didn't intend to go to air<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> During a group photo with his sons, Prince Charles muttered "I can't bear that man. He's so awful, he really is," referring to then BBC Royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell. A boom microphone set up for the pool TV coverage easily picked up the comments which were widely broadcast.
</li><li> Famous British football manager turned commentator Ron Atkinson said, referring to French player Marcel Desailly: "He is what is known in some schools as a lazy thick nigger." Although transmission in the UK had finished, his comment was broadcast to various countries in the Middle East. He had to resign from his job.
</li><li> In a similar British football incident, commentators Andy Grey and Richard Keys were sacked after they were heard on broadcast making sexist remarks about a female referee and questioning women's ability to fill the role, although separate allegations of off-air sexual harassment of colleagues also contributed.
</li><li> When Hashim Amla, a South African cricketer of Pakistani Muslim descent, dismissed an opposition player in a test match against Sri Lanka, commentator Dean Jones quipped that "the terrorist just got another wicket", believing the microphone to be off. Jones was fired the next day.

Naturally, this was picked up by the microphone that Obama was set to make the announcement on. Truth be told, though, this made Biden even <em>more</em> popular, so it can't even be seen as a gaffe.

Fast forward about four minutes later and she's about to turn the stream back on, but there's a problem...she never turned it off.

</li><li> Similarly, during the 1989 election campaign, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke referred to a pensioner who had just harangued him during a meet-and-greet as a "silly old bugger". The muttered comment was recorded by a television crew accompanying the PM and quickly became front page news across the country.
</li><li> From <em>Reader's Digest</em>: an air traffic controller aboard a US Navy aircraft carrier didn't realize his mike was still on after talking to a pilot, saying "That guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElmuhFuddSyndwome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElmuhFuddSyndwome">sounds just like Elmer Fudd.</a>" After a long, awkward silence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecatingHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecatingHumor">the pilot radioed back</a>: "Be vewy vewy quiet.

</li><li> Also from <em>Reader's Digest</em>: A woman hosting a dinner party was dismayed to see that her brother had brought his girlfriend, whom she didn't like. She and her husband left their guests enjoying drinks and hors d'oeuvres in the living room while they went upstairs under the pretense of checking on their baby. Once in the nursery, she spent several minutes venting about how much she hated the other woman. Satisfied, she and her husband went back downstairs, only to find the guests sitting in uncomfortable silence—having just heard every word that she had said over the baby monitor that was present on the coffee table.

His goggle-eyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> face is priceless.
</li><li> During the September 11th, 2001 attacks, broadcasters had far bigger things to concentrate on than FCC regulations, so most news broadcasts gave viewers an almost uninterrupted 8-hour stream of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F Bombs</a> and pointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F Strikes</a> from frightened civilians running by the cameras and witnesses who took video<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note240qj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note240qj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note240qj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mostly on camcorders, either VHS or digital.

</li></ul></li><li> In 2009, Chilean senator Fernando Flores is about to finish an interview for the CNN Chile channel. His host makes some questions that he dislikes, then finishes the interview. Just before the transmision was about to finish, a pissed-off Flores rants about how the guy's questions were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">"fucking dumb"</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqqD3b4ap78">among other things.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> That part was caught on-tape and then uploaded to Youtube...
</li><li> During the Apollo 16 lunar mission, while the astronauts were resting after a moonwalk, John Young told his colleague Charlie Duke how the potassium-laced orange juice they were given to drink was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuv6TVv0r44">giving him gas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and how he intended never to eat another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fucking</a> orange again after the flight was over. Eventually Mission Control warned him that he had a "hot mike". It seems that his mike key was stuck in the "on" position — quite possibly by some dried orange drink that had been spilled earlier. The very same orange drink he'd been complaining about.
<ul><li> Shortly after the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 moved to the lunar module, the mike setting was switched to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-operated_switch">VOX<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (voice-operated transmission) by accident. The Capcom first tried to hint that the mike was hot by responding to the astronauts' private conversation; despite the hint, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">the astronauts still failed to see that the mike setting was not on "Normal Voice".</a> It eventually had to be pointed out directly by the Capcom, similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13">the movie</a>. Even worse, later in the mission, Lovell commented privately (he thought) that it would likely be the last mission for a long time; again, the mike was on a VOX setting.

Annoyingly, the media (and inevitable backlash against the reports) focused on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical">supposed outrage over his use of profanity</a> rather than the fact that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">belittling anyone who disagreed with him</a> as a "hack" of a local political party.

</li><li> A certain air traffic controller was found to be a little distracted at work when his mike accidentally got switched on and he played his movie to all the passing planes...
</li><li> A Southwest Airline pilot ranted to his co-pilot about the lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyStewardess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyStewardess">Sexy Stewardess</a> on his flights, and having to work with only gays, grannies, and overweight folks. Unknowingly, he had turned on the mike, broadcasting to everyone in Texas airspace, but didn't even stop when an air traffic controller tried to butt in.
</li><li> In October 2011, this happened to two world leaders for the price of one. At a G20 summit, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a liar; President Obama responded "You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him every day!"
</li><li> Another rather innocent thing. A local news station had an anchor who was feeling sick to his stomach, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">was going to do the broadcast either way since it was live and he had a devotion to his job</a>. Eventually he started to feel sick during the broadcast and asked them to cut. The cameramen saw that he was getting pretty pale and sweaty, so they killed the video feed...unfortunately the audio was still being recorded, so viewers could hear the news anchor shout, "GET A BUCKET! QUI-" and then the sound of him throwing up on the floor, and it was broadcast live. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Twenty years after the incident, they still played that clip</a>.
</li><li> During the 1994 Olympics, skater Nancy Kerrigan was waiting backstage for gold medalist Oksana Baiul for the medal ceremony to take place. After having skated the best performance of her life, not to mention having come back from a disastrous year and a vicious attack, Nancy was already irritated at having lost by an uber-slim margin (a mere tenth of a point gave Baiul the gold medal over her). Further annoyed both by the delay and then upon being told that the delay was because Baiul was putting on more makeup (wrongly, as it turns out, the delay was because the Ukrainian flag and a tape of the Ukrainian Anthem could not be found<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4542i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4542i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4542i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not that surprising considering the fact that this was the first Olympics where Ukraine fielded its own independent team of athletes (although Ukrainian independence had been proclaimed in 1991, at the 1992 Olympics Ukraine together with all the other post-Soviet states - except for the Baltic ones - competed as a part of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics">unified team<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and the very first Olympic gold medal for independent Ukrainian team</span>), Kerrigan promptly snapped, "Oh, come on! So she's just going to cry again. What's the difference?". What Kerrigan didn't realize was that there was an open mike nearby and her snippety remark was just broadcasted to countless people. It was the first of a handful of missteps Kerrigan made that briefly tarnished her "America's Sweetheart" reputation that had been bestowed following her attack.
<ul><li> Nancy Kerrigan also got caught making the comment, "This is so corny. This is so dumb. I hate it. This is the most corny thing I've ever done", while sitting beside Mickey Mouse during a Disney parade.
</li><li> When she later hosted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, during her monologue, she said that what she really said was "the most <em>horny</em> thing I've every done."
</li></ul></li><li> The classic scene with then British prime minister John Major, where immediately after a BBC radio interview and thinking the mike was turned off, he described some of his less loyal Cabinet Ministers as a "bunch of bastards". The recording heard all.
</li><li> Flamboyant disc jockey and comedian Kenny Everett attended a rally of showbiz stars who support the Conservative party. Thinking it would be edited out later, in front of thousands of Tory Party faithful and a lot of cameras and press, he opened his address with "Let's bomb Russia!" The worrying thing, and the point the press picked on, was the size and duration of the cheer Everett got.
</li><li> In 2010, radio host Don Imus was heard mocking Kars4Kids on-air when their ad came on during a commercial break (the group is well-known for having a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Advertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Advertising">very</a></em> annoying jingle), telling them to go to hell, and that he'd donate his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Bentley</a> to them.
</li><li> Recently, the thoughts of Uruguayan President José Mujica about Agentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband Néstor Kirchner were caught on video. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YGTHUVQso">And they weren't pretty.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The following football season after the "wardrobe malfunction" at the Super Bowl, CBS aired a Jacksonville-Cleveland game that New Year's Eve. After a commercial break, the camera was trained on a guy in the crowd who was a dead ringer for Santa Claus and who wore a shirt that clearly read on-screen "Your ass ain't gettin' shit for Christmas!"
</li><li> A Southwest pilot managed to <a class="urllink" href="http://consumerist.com/2013/11/14/southwest-pilot-learns-he-should-stick-to-words-like-descending-and-not-were-going-down/">broadcast "were going down"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the whole plane.

While taping the introduction to a news report, she flubbed a line, then made a lighthearted joke about it:
<div class="indent">I kind of like the little stuttering thing. It's like equal opportunity, right? We've got a stuttering newscaster. We've got the black, we've got the Asian, we've got the woman.

</li></ul></li><li> In January 2014, after President Obama's State of the Union address, a TV reporter tried to ask NY congressman Michael Grimm about allegations regarding his campaign financing, but Grimm walked off, refusing to answer. Moments later, Grimm walked back, saying to the reporter "Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fucking</a> balcony." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">In April, Grimm was arrested for numerous charges of corruption, which included campaign financing</a>.
</li><li> During a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the St. Louis Rams, Rams Offensive Guard Harvey Dahl was called for holding. As the referee was declaring the penalty to the crowd, his microphone picked up Dahl shouting at the ref, "That's not fucking holding!", broadcasting the words throughout the stadium. The ref subsequently gave Dahl another penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</li><li> At the 1955 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention">Worldcon</a>, guest of honor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> was sitting at the dais as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward">Hugos</a> were being handed out. One of the winning authors was unable to attend, and editor Judith Merril accepted for him. The presenter announced this by saying, "In his absence, the award will be accepted by Judy Merril, by whom he has been so often anthologized." Asimov turned to the person next to him and said, "Anthologized? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow">Always euphemisms</a>." The microphone in front of him was live, and the hall erupted in laughter at Merril's expense. Asimov was horrified, and for the rest of the weekend (while the other attendees were saying "Anthologize you!" and "Go anthologize yourself!" to each other), he was afraid that Merril would kill him the next time their paths crossed. To her credit, she forgave him.

He said to himself, "This is not why I became an actor" ...only for his mic to be on and the whole studio hearing it. Fortunately, Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew made up for it later, putting quite a bit of effort into making a personal "relaxation" space for Sir McKellen on the set to cheer him up. It worked.
</li><li> During the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJinx">The Jinx</a>: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst</em>, a documentary filmed in 2013 about the investigations surrounding the long-time suspected murderer millionaire, Durst left to use the restroom after an interview with one a reporter, forgetting that his mic was on. The sound editor was then treated to the sound of Durst relieving himself... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">followed by his muttering of "What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."</a> Durst was arrested in 2015, following the release of the documentary.
</li><li> A. J. Clemente holds the dubious distinction of having possibly the shortest career in the history of newsreading, thanks to the first words out of his mouth on his first day on the job being a frustrated <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV4XjuWc2nk">Gay... fucking shit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the studio feed went live. He and his co-anchor completed one very awkward news session, and he was fired at the end of it.
</li><li> In 2012 the British radio station Jazz FM <a class="urllink" href="http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/ofcom-finds-jazz-fm-in-breach-of-broadcasting-code-over-porno-noises/048675">accidentally broadcast<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> five minutes of graphic sounds of gay sex. It was later revealed that an unnamed station employee (reportedly later sacked) had been watching a porn video on the studio computer, without realising that the computer's audio output was also going to the broadcast feed.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZNbWxzW0Zc">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Mexican news anchor insults a pair of fellow news anchormen on air not too long after the commercial break ended. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">His reaction</a> is priceless, and then the video went viral and spawned a few memes.
</li><li> Modern audio mikes used at sporting events such as hockey and (American/Canadian) football are sensitive enough to pick up the sounds of the action to enhance the broadcast, and usually the people in the truck are quick enough to switch the audio feed so that the action is all that's heard, but it's not uncommon to hear a player swear just after a particularly heavy bodycheck or tackle, complaining about a call, or expressing excitement. And with many refs now equipped with wireless mikes to explain calls, they will also sometimes pick up a player in the background expressing their discontent with it. Most sportscasts simply ignore it happened.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s 2016 presidential campaign was subject to countless controversies that would've ended any other politician's career. On October 7th, 2016, blooper footage was leaked to NBC and <em>The Washington Post</em> from a 2005 interview between Trump and Billy Bush, then anchor for <em>Access Hollywood</em>, in which Trump seemingly boasted about his predilection for sexual assault, bragging that he could "grab [women] by the pussy" and force them into sex because of his fame. Trump talked at length about sleeping with Nancy O'Dell, Bush's <em>Access Hollywood</em> co-anchor, with Bush joking and playing along. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">NBC initially tried to shield Bush from scrutiny, but public outcry forced the network to suspend and eventually fire him</a> from <em>Today</em>. Meanwhile, it greatly sank Trump's campaign as a bunch of other women came forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. However, even all this didn't significantly prevent female Republicans from voting for him, as Democrats had hoped.
</li><li> A memoir written by an RAF Blenheim pilot during WW2 relates how they paid particular attention to the position of a certain switch during their pre-flight check after a lewd discussion by the crew of a Blenheim regarding a newly-arrived WAAF was relayed live to the woman in question, who eventually ran screaming out of the radio room. The CO was not amused.
</li><li> This destroyed the career of former Virginia Senator George Allen. In 2006, Allen was a former Congressman and Governor who was running for a second term against former Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb. Allen held a solid lead until August 11, 2006; on that day, Allen was caught on video using the ethnic slur "macaca" (a slur against Indian people) in the presence of a Webb staffer of Indian heritage. The controversy magnified by changing explanations from the Allen campaign, and separate controversies over Allen's comments attempting to deny and eventually downplay the Jewish ethnic heritage of his mother Henrietta. Similar uses of racial epithets during Allen's college years also began to crop up around this time. This led to Allen losing by just under 10,000 votes, with that race being the last to be called and which ended up swinging control of the Senate to the Democrats.
</li><li> In a more benign example, on occasion you can hear behind-the-scenes banter between crew members over a slate. One such example is the August 31, 1987 edition of <em>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</em>.
</li><li> Alt-right leader Richard Spencer had a tape leaked where he goes on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">unhinged rant</a> about how "kikes" and "octoroons" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5nui5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5nui5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5nui5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> an obsolete term for one-eighth black people </span> are responsible for all his problems and how his ancestors would have "enslaved those pieces of shit."
</li><li> With the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a> making their normal in-person sessions too dangerous, many courts around the world have turned to telephone or video-conference to hold hearings. A hearing in the United States Supreme Court on a challenge to a provision of the Consumer Telephone Protection Act was interrupted by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/toilet-flush-supreme-court-oral-arguments/index.html">the sound of a toilet flushing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Nobody is quite sure who that was.
</li><li> During a broadcast of a Cincinnati Reds doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals, Fox Sports announcer Thom Brennaman was heard describing Kansas City as "one of the biggest fag capitals of the world," while coming back from commercial break. Brennaman immediately left the broadcast and apologized, but Fox Sports later revealed that he would be suspended for the rest of the 2020 season's baseball and football broadcasts.
</li><li> During a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, also conducted by video chat, asking questions of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) was having a bit of trouble with his microphone, then accidentally sent the rest of the committee <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/politics/postmaster-general-senate-hearing-takeaways/index.html">a triple F-bomb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Averted, more or less, by Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, when making a joke while waiting to deliver a speech at the DNC. Fully aware that she had a hot mic under her nose, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1295542788046630913">she deliberately censored her own words<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "It's Shark Week, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthingTheProfanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthingTheProfanity">m***r</a>." (She later clarified <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/gretchen-whitmer-shark-week-motherfucker">what this meant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
