She agrees and asks Moritaka's partner Takagi to do the same.

</li><li> Lelouch gains many more Secret Keepers as the second season progresses with the likes of Kallen and his own maid, Sayoko, but after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, only a handful of people in the world know that Zero <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has been replaced by Suzaku Kururugi</span> (including Kallen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nunnally</span>, and probably others like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ohgi, Kaguya and the rest of the highranked Black Knights</span>) .
</li><li> On another level, Milly Ashford and Suzaku Kururugi are the only ones of Lelouch's friends who are aware of his and Nunally's royal heritage, since the former's family are the ones sheltering them and the latter lived with them during their initial exile.

<ul><li> Well, actually Ai Haibara and Vermouth are <em>part</em> of the secret. In fact, it could be argued that they are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> directly responsible for it</span>, so they may not qualify.
</li><li> The trope gets invoked in a <em>nasty</em> manner in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> case. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A girl named Shouko Utakura finds her friend Sawanami dead and, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingClue">dying clues</a>, she realises that their common acquaintance Mifune is the murderer. However, Shouko is Mifune's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedTragicMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedTragicMaiden">Unrequited Tragic Maiden</a> and decides to keep this a secret... but commits the huge mistake of <em>actually</em> telling Mifune that she knew the truth, but wouldn't snitch. Mifune, who had killed Sawanami because he was involved in his girlfriend's death <em>and</em> now believes Shouko had something to do with it too, thinks she'll denounce him anyway <em>and a few days later he strangles her to death</em>, having a breakdown when he's uncovered as the killer <em>and</em> another woman explains Shouko's true feelings.</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s secrets have a surprisingly large number of protectors:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> discovered Clark Kent's secret identity around the time they got engaged. Afterwards, Lois was a very able Secret Keeper. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> books, however, Lois, like her Pre-Crisis counterparts, doesn't know. And after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a>, with her marriage to Clark restored to continuity, she knows again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne</a> is also one of Clark's Secret Keepers (as is Clark for Bruce). This led to an amusing sequence when Bruce assumed Lois knew <em>his</em> secret, because he didn't expect Clark to keep secrets from his wife, whereas Clark felt it wasn't his secret to share. By the end of the story Lois has become another of Bruce's Secret Keepers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a>, in pre-Crisis what-passed-for-continuity, sometimes knew Clark's secret and sometimes didn't. In some stories she knew it but was hypnotized to only <em>remember</em> it in certain circumstances (such as, for example, being in the 30th century as Insect Queen... yeah, the Silver Age was like that). One 1958 story even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> why (Silver Age) Lana would make a poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a> when she tried to cook up a new secret identity for an amnesiac Superboy as her 'cousin Andy'. Unfortunately her attempts to cover for 'Andy' backfired badly and she later ruefully concluded she just wasn't "smart enough" to hang onto the secret without blowing it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> onward, Lana definitely knows since Clark told her and has been a special confidant to him ever since.
</li><li> Jonathan and Martha Kent started keeping Clark's secret long before he knew about it himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> knows her cousin's secret in all eras, and Superman also knows her Secret Identity. In the Pre-Crisis universe, Kara often helped him protect his Clark Kent persona.
</li><li> Pete Ross discovered Superman's secret ID back when he was just Superboy during a camping trip. A convenient flash of lightning revealed Clark changing clothes, and Pete kept it secret, not even letting Superboy know that he knew. He once even used his knowledge to become an honorary member of the Legion of Super-Heroes by claiming he had telepathy and knew Superboy's secret ID. Writing the identity on a lead tablet so Superboy couldn't see. Superboy assumed Pete was bluffing and that everyone else was just going along with the joke.
</li><li> In the New 52's <em>Superman</em> #38, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark reveals his secret to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a>.</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Clark</strong>: [shaking hands] It seems we covered the same event, Parker  though I don't recall seeing <strong>you</strong> there. <br/><strong>Peter</strong>: I stick to the <strong>shadows</strong>, Kent... apparently just like you.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptonNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptonNoMore">Krypton No More</a></em>, villains Protector and Radion kept each others' existence secret for years.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em>'s secret identity has a good number of protectors:
<ul><li> In the Pre-Crisis era, her Secret Identity is Linda Lee Danvers. Her cousin Superman, her foster parents Fred and Edna Danvers and Barbara Gordon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a></em> know this. In 2004 it was revealed that her childhood crush Dick Malverne always knew, but he kept mum.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Post-Crisis era</a>, Superman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>, Pa and Ma Kent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a> know that Linda Lang is Supergirl. Lana actually helped Kara set it up, pretending that she is her niece. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2009">Stephanie Brown</a></em> -the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a></em>- knows Kara's secret identity and vice versa.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth">Supergirl (Rebirth)</a></em>, only Supergirl's foster parents -Jeremiah and Eliza Danvers- and her boss -Director Cameron Chase- know who Kara Danvers is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElseworldsFinestSupergirlAndBatgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElseworldsFinestSupergirlAndBatgirl">Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl</a></em>, Supergirl and Batgirl -Barbara Gordon- figured out each other's identities.
</li></ul></li><li> More people are in on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne's</a> secret than one might expect:
<ul><li> Alfred Pennyworth is his primary Secret Keeper. He knows things about Bruce that even Dick Grayson doesn't know.
</li><li> Lucius Fox is sometimes portrayed as most likely knowing that Batman and Bruce Wayne are one and the same, but not telling anyone, not even Bruce, this knowledge.
</li><li> In "Hush," The Riddler reveals that he deduced Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> while taking a dip in a Lazarus Pit. However, Batman convinces him to keep it secret for two reasons: first, having such a secret is no fun for an obsessive puzzler like him if every one knows it; second, it would give the owner of the Lazarus Pits, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Ra's Al Ghul, a vital clue that the Riddler used a pit without permission, and he would have his League of Assassins kill the Riddler no matter where he is. More recently, the Riddler has developed a mental block preventing him from remembering this.
</li><li> "Hush" actually showed a <em>lot</em> of Batman Secret Keepers: the Robins, Superman and Lois Lane, the Huntress, Leslie Thompkins, Zatanna, Batgirl, Catwoman, Ra's and Talia Al Ghul...
</li><li> Jim Gordon is generally portrayed as being a good enough detective to have found Batman's secret, but reserved enough not to tell anyone, even Bruce, likely because it would put him in an uncomfortable legal position. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman">Superman/Batman</a></em>, Batman, while noting the same thing about Superman's Perry White, reveals that he's aware that Gordon most likely knows. In <em>Batman: Year One</em>, after an unmasked Bruce saves his son's life, Gordon is clearly blatantly lying when he says his lack of glasses prevents him from recognizing the man, who he has met before, standing less than two feet away from him in broad daylight.
</li><li> In the New 52, it's revealed that Harvey Dent has known that Bruce was Batman for a long time, but has to constantly fight himself in order to convince himself not to kill Bats or out him.
</li><li> It's been shown (primarily by Amanda Waller) that at least some people in the government are aware of who Bruce really is, but allow him to carry on generally because they don't see Batman as a threat to them. Or possibly because multi-billionaire Bruce Wayne, with his power and connections, <em>is</em>, so it's better to let him spend his money on toys to fight crime and other threats than to turn it on them.
</li></ul></li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em>, Barbara Gordon revealed her operations as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle">Oracle</a> to her father, who was initially stunned but ultimately proud of his daughter. Barbara then pulled out her old Batgirl costume, saying, "I'm so glad that you're handling this so well, Dad, because there's more to it, I'm afraid." Jim Gordon's response: "Okay, this part I knew."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a> has her dad, Colonel Kane, who is also her main source of logistical support. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">Renee Montoya</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> deduce her identity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> (the former knows her quite intimately, while the latter comments that she has been leaving him clues on purpose as a sign of trust).
</li><li> Mary Jane Watson is the most well-known of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s Secret Keeper. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> counterpart was the first to be told (Peter told her soon after acquiring his powers).
<ul><li> Aunt May until that entire "One More Day" thing happened.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, former bully Kenny McFarlane. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Kenny</a> actually figures it out on his own, staying up late at night, thinking about Peter's new awesomeness (ie: he flipped Kenny once, broke Flash's hand, replaced Flash on the basketball team, etc.) and Spidey's apparent availability at Midtown High School. Then he tests it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Peter Parker</strong>: (to himself, while he's loading books in his locker) What the-? Oh, come on... My Spider-Sense is going off at school. That can only mean one thing. And the Academy Award for best performance by an amateur super hero trying desperately to hold onto his secret identity goes to... <br/><strong>Kenny</strong>: <em>[kicks him into the locker]</em> <br/><strong>Peter Parker</strong>: Ow! Owy ow! Why did you- ow! What is wrong with you!!?? Ow- Owww!!
</div></li><li> Miles Morales, the new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, shared the secret of his powers with his friend Ganke.
</li><li> Aunt May seems to play this role in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em> movies, particularly the second movie, where she gives Peter a speech seemingly directed at Spider-Man, which helps him decide to become Spider-Man again.
</li><li> Aunt May definitely plays this role later in <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>. With that awesome matriarchy, Aunt May subverts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a>. At one point, she pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless">gun on a recognized supervillain</a>.
</li><li> Daredevil and Spider-Man knew each other's identities for a long time. Currently, neither remembers the other's identity due to some shenanigans both pulled on separate occasions; Spidey made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> and Matt did some unexplained trick.
</li></ul></li><li> Over in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em> universe, Gwen Stacy revealed her identity as Spider-Woman to her father.
</li><li> Jaime Reyes, the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a>, was thrown a year into the future after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>. His family, naturally enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">freaked out</a> on his return, so Jaime decided to prove his story about what had happened to him by revealing his secret identity. His family and friends know, but keep it a secret outside of that.
<ul><li> The second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, had his girlfriend Tracy as a Secret Keeper during his Charlton incarnation.
</li></ul></li><li> It's revealed in DC Comics' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em>, that all the superheroes (the ones whose identities remain a secret) know each other's identities.
<ul><li> Whether or not the superheroes' secret keepers are aware of the others are open to debate. Especially considering that Jean Loring knows Tim Drake is Robin, despite Tim having his identity a deep secret even from Bruce's allies.
</li></ul></li><li> Wesley Dodds' girlfriend Dian Belmont knows he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SandmanMysteryTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SandmanMysteryTheatre">the Sandman</a>, and occasionally helps him in his cases.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> Hal Jordan's first Secret Keeper was his airplane mechanic, Tom Kalmaku. When Tom accidentally learned Hal's identity, he respected GL enough to offer to let him erase the memory from his mind—but the offer convinced Hal that Tom was trustworthy, so he let him keep the knowledge and they became close friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a villainous example, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaredevilBornAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaredevilBornAgain">Born Again</a></em> onwards, Wilson Fisk learns Daredevil's real identity. But he keeps it a complete secret for years, to the point that among his goons, it's well known that he knew exactly who DD was. However, a no-name criminal decides that this is unacceptable, since Daredevil still ruins criminal operations, and thus, Fisk is indirectly responsible for the losses other gangs have suffered. Thus, the upstart turns all of Fisk's goons against him.
</li><li> Foggy Nelson is a longtime secret keeper. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel">All-New, All-Different Marvel</a> run, after Matt somehow forces the world to forget that he's Daredevil, he allowed Foggy to remember, thus making Foggy Matt's <em>only</em> secret keeper.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> story "Pastoral", all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseKnitCommunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseKnitCommunity">Close-Knit Community</a> in which he works knows Roustabout's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> but hide it.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DominoLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DominoLady">Domino Lady</a></em> comics, Ellen's friend Lulu Chambers serves this role for Ellen.

<ul><li> As stated above, the trope namer is the Fidelius Charm, a spell that makes one individual a literal Secret Keeper; as long as they keep the secret, it cannot be found out by anybody else. In addition, even if the Secret Keeper does tell someone the secret, that someone is unable to pass on the knowledge unless the original Secret Keeper dies, in which case they become the new Secret Keeper. This is most often used to conceal locations. The house where Harry and his parents lived was guarded under the Secret Keeper charm so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort</a> couldn't ever find them.

This is a notable change from the books, where he <em>was</em> the one who brought his suspicions to Jon Arryn in the first place and helped him investigate, but then left court out of fear for his life and resentment Robert didn't make him Hand.

Only Father Lantom figured it out himself; Foggy found him beaten up from a fight with Wilson Fisk and Nobu, and Claire after he was lured into a trap by the Russians.
</li><li> In the final episode of season 2, Karen Page becomes one, and the first person to whom Matt openly admitted the secret of his own volition.
</li><li> While never stated out loud, it is heavily implied that Frank Castle is one as well and figured out Matt's secret identity when he saw him out-of-costume at the hospital.
</li><li> Elektra and Stick are aware of it, though this is a minor example in that they're minimally involved in Matt's day-to-day life.

Towards the end of the season, Matt unmasks himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FBIAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FBIAgent">Ray Nadeem</a>, making Nadeem only the second person (after Karen) he's ever willingly revealed his secret to, and it's to show his gratitude to Nadeem for helping Foggy and Brett rescue Karen from an assassination attempt by Dex ("You saved Karen Page's life tonight, so I owe you"). This unmasking also serves a second purpose of making sure Nadeem knows that he can trust Nelson &amp; Murdock to help him speak out against Wilson Fisk's criminal activities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15j25');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15j25" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15j25');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">earlier, Matt-as-Daredevil and Nadeem had found out Dex was behind the <em>Bulletin</em> attack, broke into Dex's apartment to find evidence, Dex came home and shot Nadeem as he and Matt were escaping. When Nadeem tried to inform his boss about what Fisk had done to Dex, he ended up finding out that his boss had been blackmailed into working for Fisk, and she subsequently blackmailed him into doing the same; which for Nadeem meant rounding up crime lords for an extortion racket Fisk was creating, as well as being Dex's driver when Dex was tasked with killing Karen to avenge James Wesley</span>. Unfortunately, their efforts to put Nadeem before the grand jury fail as Fisk intimidates the jurors. He is subsequently killed at his house by Dex on Vanessa's orders. Matt learns about this from Fisk's fixer Felix Manning. So as a result, in the season finale, after defeating Fisk and Dex in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATRois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATRois">Melee AT Rois</a>, Matt unmasks himself in front of Fisk and Vanessa, and blackmails Fisk into being a secret keeper by threatening to go public with his knowledge that Vanessa ordered Nadeem's death if Fisk tries to out Matt or hurt Karen and Foggy.

This means that in most, if not all, U.S. jurisdictions that if an attorney find out their client committed a crime for which an innocent person's in jail, their ethical obligations to their client prevent them from saying anything without their client's permission, even if the other person is serving a life sentence. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingSecretsSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingSecretsSucks">Keeping Secrets Sucks</a>.

Straczynski was this to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_O%27Hare">Michael O'Hare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. O'Hare played the lead character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> but left after the first season. The reason for the departure was that O'Hare was battling bouts of paranoid delusions; this both hurt Straczynski's relationships with his cast members, who weren't privy to this knowledge, and threatened to damage the show. After discussing things with O'Hare, JMS wrote his character off in a way that would allow him to return when he was better, and publicly gave false reports on why the character was written off. Even after the show ended in 1998, JMS continued to not reveal the secret until O'Hare's death in 2012, in keeping with the man's wishes.
</li><li> The word "secretary" literally means "secret keeper". While most modern day secretaries spend more time doing paperwork and the like, the original meaning is preserved in terms like "Secretary Of Defense", a person privy to a lot of secret military information, who advises the President on such things.
