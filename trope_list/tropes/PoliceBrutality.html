Sometimes this may be to make a statement about ethnic relations (e.g., <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoTheRightThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoTheRightThing">Do the Right Thing</a></em>), as part of a gloomy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>-type <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> setting (e.g., <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>), or as part of a futuristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> setting (e.g., <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>).

</p><p>If you are fortunate enough to live in a relatively free country and unfortunate enough to witness police brutality, surreptitiously filming it is a good way to back yourself up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0868b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0868b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0868b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> However, you need to also be mindful of the fact that a number of areas have <em>legally banned</em> videotaping the police  ostensibly on privacy grounds  and police in those localities will be empowered to arrest you if they see you filming (or at least confiscate, and/or smash your camera). Even in areas where it's not actually banned, the police typically do not like being filmed, and may well take steps against you if they think they can.</span> In many jurisdictions nowadays, the police themselves often wear cameras to film arrests and make it easier to avoid misunderstandings, and/or abuse.

It later turns out the pair both had some long records of complaints for excessive force. The police officer guarding the mayor who later shoots Veronica is another example, as he does this after ordering her to stop while flying, even though she didn't have a weapon or pose any visible threat.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> books feature an entire subseries revolving around a police force. While mostly a humorous and sympathetic depiction, particularly since they're usually the viewpoint characters, this does come up a bit:
<ul><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> with the Unmentionables, but Vimes' personal narration takes great care to note that beating people up in small rooms for good reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">always leads to beating up people in small rooms for bad reasons</a>. This is pretty central to Vimes' psychology — he's pretty strict on himself and his subordinates because he's a big believer in the slippery slope and he wants to make damn sure no one slides down it. However, he's not above making the indirect threat of 'Falling Down The Stairs' if a suspect isn't being cooperative. They tend to be much more agreeable afterward (but again, would you antagonize a Troll or the Six-Foot-Tall "Dwarf"?).
</li><li> The Ankh-Morpork version of "Miranda" includes such clauses as "You have the right not to throw yourself out the window"... most likely added to give a figleaf to practices under Vetinari's predecessors, Homicidal Lord Winder and Mad Lord Snapcase.

</li><li> There's a book about a time traveler who was trapped in a burning building and could only travel to a certain period for a set time before being pulled back. He makes multiple trips to San Francisco and tries to stop the rape of a friend in the '60s. His suggestion to call the police just has another friend ask if he wants the police to rape her as well.
</li><li> In <em>Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets</em>, author David Simon follows a shift of the Baltimore Police Department homicide unit, and among other things, presents a fairly even-handed view of police brutality. To wit, at least in that department, it's considered unethical to hit a suspect in handcuffs or to obtain a statement (not to mention the officer's career isn't worth it), but it's perfectly okay to goad a suspect into striking a cop (and beating him down "in self-defense"; one officer even keeps a photo of the suspect's face afterwards), or for a suspect in a crime involving a cop or their family to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">fall down the stairs</a>" several times between being photographed at the precinct and being dropped off at central booking.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the book goes into long detail, in an almost lamenting tone, that suspects actually fear the police less and less. In the old days, a suspect thought to have shot a cop was essentially in a race for their life to turn themselves in at a precinct completely across town, where they would <em>only</em> be beaten. If the guy was caught in the cop's own district, he'd have been shot dead and his death justified as self-defense.
</li><li> While acknowledging that genuine brutality does exist, the book also makes the point that in the homicide unit at least, nine out of ten cases that the detectives will encounter will be criminal-on-criminal violence. The author thus argues that in most cases the detective has little personal stake in the case and little reason to want to risk a conviction, their clear-up rate, and their career just to rough up a small-time criminal in order to prove that they murdered another small-time criminal.

First, an officer pulls Hazel Motes over for driving without a license, then destroys Hazel's car by pushing it over an embankment. Second, two police officers find Hazel lying in a ditch, barely conscious. When they tell him that his landlady wants him to return, he says he doesn't want to, so they club him the rest of the way into unconsciousness and load him into their car. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hazel dies on the way back to his apartment.</span>

<ul><li> While technically still falling under the trope, Harry was not a civilian at the time, he was an (irregularly) licensed private investigator on contract with the police. He was essentially getting beaten by a fellow cop for breaking procedure and the ethics of the profession.

</li><li> The Wardens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Theatrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Theatrica">Theatrica</a></em> verge on the brutal. Sometimes a harsh accusation from a would-be victim is enough for them to bring the full, violent force of the law down on any given individual. One warden in particular qualifies for this trope...

Beka and her partners frequently hit, thump, kick, and smack their suspects — but they only do it when they're <em>pretty sure</em> it will legitimately help them in their inquiries. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Cage Dogs</a>, though, count even by the setting's standards. They get paid extra because otherwise it's tricky to find enough people <em>willing</em> to do the things they do (Beka almost quit during training when she thought that she might be forced to become one, which is untrue). Most street dogs consider them little better than thugs and a nuisance that they have to resort to because of how truth spells are legally restricted.
</li><li> Thoroughly deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/McAuslan">McAuslan</a></em>: MacNeill reflects that the British Army's reputation for gunning down rioters for little reason is pretty well-justified, but what do you do when, as a military unit wholly untrained in crowd control, you get put in front of a rioting mob with no non-lethal options, and the situation deteriorates?
<ul><li> The Royal Military Police are depicted as having a fairly direct approach, often returning drunks and deserters to their regimental cells in a somewhat unconscious and battered state. How much is needless brutality and how much is just the effects of alcohol and necessary subduing methods is never elaborated on. Either way, the Gordon Highlanders' regimental provost — its internal police force — is a model of fair-minded "tough love". You still wouldn't want to cross Provost-Sergeant McGarry, though.

On one hand, they are brutal in subduing him, but that's because he's a professional mercenary and so is capable of hurting them if they are not quick. One of them spits on and curses him, but she is immediately punished by her immediate superior. He then apologises to Eric and tells him that she is new to the force and doesn't know the code of conduct yet. He also tells Eric that he believes Eric's crime to be worthy of brutality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">but that would not be lawful</a> and so he will restrain himself.

Because the KGB might have an informant inside the police station, a doppelganger is being roughed up in another cell.

</li><li> A major part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfected">The Infected</a></em>, where in the beginning the protagonist, one Brian Yi, is brutalized and nearly killed by the police for being a filthy Infected (mutant, essentially). <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PostTraumaticStressDistorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PostTraumaticStressDistorder">This so profoundly affects him</a>, he becomes convinced all policemen are monsters, and in future misunderstandings, has to be restrained from killing cops by his peers. Which causes the police to try and murder him, which makes everything worse... The initial event is later retconned as mind-control, sympathetic police characters are introduced, and all of the other characters seem to regard Brian's hostility to the police as a nuisance and a serious liability. The message seems to be that police brutality exists and is terrible, and neither tacitly accepting this or making blanket attacks against the police are okay.

<ul><li> In <em>Renegadepress.com</em>'s "The Ride", finding himself in trouble with the law, Jack decides to write a story about police brutality for the titular website.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em>: Several episodes have addressed the subject, usually using one-shot characters.
<ul><li> While Malloy was almost always able to keep his cool even with the most smug of villains, he blows it in the 1974 episode "X-Force" and is suspended without pay for four days after a suspect he had arrested complains that he was injured. Malloy had arrested a suspected child molester (the crook had raped a 6-year-old girl who lived in the neighborhood), and when the pedophile made a snide remark about how the little girl "got what she wanted," Malloy shoves him against a wall, twists his arm, and puts the handcuffs on too tight. (Reed — who ironically was taught by Malloy about keeping his cool in the early seasons — shows up to calm his veteran partner down, and eventually has to make a statement backing the complainant.)
</li><li> Malloy and Reed have also been victimized by claims of police brutality, particularly in the episode "Good Cop: Handle With Care." There, two rogue freelance journalists harass our protagonist officers as they go about their daily work, eventually catching their prey as Reed and Malloy were in the midst of handling a hallucinogenic subject who had gone into a violent seizure. As the officers take the drugged-out man to the emergency room for detoxification, the photographer snaps a picture; the man had a bloody nose, the result of his head hitting the seat frame as he was shaking violently and uncontrollably. However, the journalists' story makes it out to be classic police brutality. Sgt. Mac McDonald (the officers' superior) questions Reed and Malloy, who are of course cleared (although this is not ever explicitly stated in the episode). In the end, the journalists' harassment of Reed and Malloy and insistence that they were rogue cops out to brutalize people leads to them interfering with an arrest and getting an innocent bystander shot.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire">Boardwalk Empire</a></em>, the Atlantic City police are less "police" than they are glorified muscle for Nucky Thompson's criminal empire, what with his brother being Sheriff and everything.
<ul><li> Two New York cops beat information out of Lucky Luciano, telling him they can do whatever they want because they're the law. It turns out that they're shaking Lucky down on behalf of Arnold Rothstein.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em> got in on it at least once as well, in an episode showing the police application process of the time. Friday and Gannon were suspicious of one applicant with a 6-month gap in his background history, and it was discovered he'd been kicked off another town's sheriff force for police brutality.
<ul><li> In another episode, Friday and Gannon deal with an officer who got angry at being called a pig and having his uniform shirt torn by a drunk man. It's a crossover, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Reed and Malloy</a> as the backups.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fortitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fortitude">Fortitude</a></em>, when Frank Sutter is suspected of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlie Stoddard</span>'s murder, DCI Anderson goes to arrest him and, upon finding him naked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Elena's</a> shower, he goes berserk and punches him repeatedly in the head.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006">Life On Mars</a></em>: DCI Hunt has a tendency to let his anger be his guide in investigation/interrogation rather than a sense of due process. Yeah, forget things like "facts" or "due process" or "the truth": Let's just go out and reenact scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish">Death Wish</a></em>.
<ul><li> Note that the traditional explanation for suffering injuries while in British police custody is "falling down the stairs"; bonus points if this is in a police station where the cells are on the ground floor.
</li><li> It should also be noted that the conflict between the old-style policing of Gene Hunt and the modern/futuristic policing of Sam Tyler is the central dramatic conflict in the show, but even then, there are external forces in the 1970s for the police to rein in such brutality, as evidenced in the series finale.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008">Ashes to Ashes (2008)</a></em> plays it for laughs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureForFunAndInformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureForFunAndInformation">more often</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Gene Hunt:</strong> One more thing, luv, about police brutality. Expect lots of it.
</div></li><li> In the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLastDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLastDetective">The Last Detective</a></em>, while the protagonist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">By-the-Book Cop</a>, his DCI is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper">Old-Fashioned Copper</a> — think a washed-up Gene Hunt. In one episode, the latter talks nostalgically about no longer being able to have suspects "fall down the stairs".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>:
<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> episode featured zombie cops whose brutality was so extreme that it would have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">unbelievable</a> for regular human cops to behave in such a way. They shot Wesley just for approaching them while they were harassing Gunn and a few of his friends. Of course, it <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">the LAPD</a>. While certainly not condoning police brutality, the episode briefly explores another side of this trope, when Gunn tells a drug-dealing acquaintance of his that it's people like him that can make police think they have to cross the line. It also notes that before the zombie cops were brought in, the neighbourhood had one of the worst crime rates in the city... but it had plummeted since.
</li><li> Another example in "A New World" when Connor confronts Angel while Tyke and his gang have them at gunpoint. The LAPD storm in and show no interest in trying to make the arrest, instead choosing to execute everyone, shooting Angel and trying to kill a fleeing Connor. Compare and contrast the Buffy episode <em>Two to Go</em> where the Sunnydale police are unsure of what to do with a vengeful Willow but keep her at gunpoint as she rips open the prison.
</li><li> Late in season seven of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>,]] with the Hellmouth working overtime, it corrupts the police to target the forces of good, in this case holding off the potentials while they attempt to kill Faith.
</li></ul></li><li> Vic Mackey and others from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>. The show was inspired by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_Scandal">horrific scandal at the LAPD's Rampart Division<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which included some rather eye-popping allegations: A bank robbery planned by a police officer, multiple suspects killed with weapons planted on them for justification, actually joining the "Bloods" street gang, stealing drugs from the evidence locker for hip-hop producer Suge Knight, and murdering Notorious B.I.G.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, officers regularly assault hoodlums, including minors, in their custody, though few officers are portrayed as actual corrupt cops. It's simply considered part of "the game". Assaulting regular citizens, however, isn't allowed. For example, when Herc mistakes a deacon for a drug-runner, he gets fired for roughing him up.
<ul><li> During a raid on the Pit where the Barksdale stash houses are located, Bodie punches the elderly "hump" known as Pat Mahon. This prompts Herc, Carver, and Kima to engage in a three-man beatdown.
</li><li> More notable is when Bird is arrested and brought in for interrogation. Before they even start the interrogation, Jay Landsman takes a Polaroid of Bird's injuries so that Bird can't claim they were inflicted in custody. Except, Bird continues to use vulgar language and lewd remarks at his interrogators (especially against the lesbian Kima Greggs), prompting Daniels to ceremoniously tear up the Polaroid, before he, Landsman, and Kima deliver a three-man beatdown to Bird.
</li><li> Another is when Roland Pryzbylewski pistol-whips a fourteen-year-old boy in the face, blinding the kid in one eye. This goes so far beyond the pale that even Herc and Carver (who are responsible for a <em>lot</em> of police brutality themselves) stare at Prez and Carver verbally asks, "What the fuck's the matter with you?" Despite his partners and Daniels covering for him and coaching him about what to say to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">IID</a>, Prez gets taken off patrolling entirely and his gun taken away after the incident. An uncomfortable moment happens a few episodes later when the detail nabs one of the Barksdale gang's runners, and Prez immediately recognizes him as the guy he attacked.
</li><li> Anthony Colicchio, one of the Western District cops in Carver's Drug Enforcement Unit squad beginning in season 3. He enforces drug rules by brute force, eschewing any subtlety or understanding of the streets, and sports the soldier's mentality that Major Colvin decries as detrimental to good law enforcement. He increasingly goes off the rails in seasons 4 and 5, becoming more brutal and aggressive. The final straw is when he attacks a school teacher who is just politely asking him to move his patrol car out of the way so the teacher can get to work. Carver is disturbed by Colicchio's complete lack of remorse and refuses to cover for him, writing him up for excessive force and conduct unbecoming a police officer.
</li><li> Eddie Walker is a notoriously corrupt patrol officer in the Western District, feared on the streets because of his willingness to inflict police brutality on anyone from Omar to little kids and to engage in acts such as robbing suspects before they are arrested. For instance, he breaks a sixth grader's fingers because the kid stole a car and went on a joyride simply for that fact it meant that Walker would have to fill out extra paperwork. Some cops see his brutal, no-holds-barred methods of policing as the only way to keep street kids in line, while others (most prominently McNulty) see Walker as an asshole who shouldn't be on the force.
</li><li> McNulty, of all people, is the only main character in the show's fictional version of the Baltimore Police Department who is <em>never</em> shown to physically harm a citizen. It's possible he picked this up from working under Bunny Colvin, who was also disdainful of excessive force and the "soldier mentality," and found himself frequently frustrated with the younger, more militant and aggressive cops under his command. McNulty is also never alleged or implied to have participated in any offscreen police brutality. His aforementioned attitudes toward cops Walker and Colicchio, and his preference for other modes of peacekeeping and investigation, are consistent with this portrayal. It's implied throughout the series that other cops don't much like or trust him, and it might be that way because they are afraid he would not cover for them.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoseLineIsItAnyway">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a></em> a couple of times:
<ul><li> In a game of "Hollywood Director," Brad, playing a cop responding to a car accident between Ryan and Wayne, immediately after arriving on the scene, beat up Wayne for no other reason than because he's black.
</li><li> Another game had Ryan and Colin playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop">Good Cop/Bad Cop</a> pair of dishwasher repairmen; the game ended with Wayne stuffed into his dishwasher.
</li><li> Wayne played one himself during a game of Let's Make A Date when he's given the character of a power-mad highway patrolman. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByBYTDkvte8&amp;feature=related">"I don't think anybody gave you license to talk, here in Callihappimussisoopi County!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied a number of times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes">The Young Ones</a></em>. In one episode, after Rick has been eulogising Felicity Kendal, a policeman breaks into the house, hits him with a chair, and says "Let me assure you that I would not have done that if you had been Felicity Kendal".
<ul><li> In another episode, a man rings the doorbell to the student's flat. He is accosted by a policeman:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cop:</strong> Ho ho ho. Hahahahaha. Well, Mr. Sambo Darkie Coon, I've got your number. You're nicked. <br/><em>[We see the man's face. He's clearly white.]</em> <br/><strong>Man:</strong> Is there anything the matter, officer? <br/><strong>Cop:</strong> Ho ho ho, oh dear me. Don't we talk lovely, Mr. Rastus Chocolate Drop. Now listen here, son. I've done a weekend's training with the S.A.S. I could pull both your arms off and leave no trace of violence. Lord Scarman need never know. <br/><strong>Man:</strong> What seems to be the trouble, officer? <br/><strong>Cop:</strong> That's white man's electricity you're burnin', ringin' that bell. That's theft. I've got your number, so hold out your hands. <br/><strong>Man:</strong> Officer, I represent Kellogg's Corn Flakes car competition. I— <br/><em>[The cop removes his sunglasses and sees the man for the first time.]</em> <br/><strong>Cop:</strong> Oh. Sorry, John. I thought you was a nigger. Now, Sir, carry on.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em>, the titular officer holds a purse-snatcher at gunpoint and orders him to beat himself up. This is typical of how he treats suspects.
<ul><li> In another episode, Sledge pitches the benefits of being a cop on the basis that he gets paid to legally beat up and kill people.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>: Detective Eliot Stabler gets away with a disgusting amount of this, probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">people consider the guys he badgers and brutalizes deserving of their fates</a>. Even though he occasionally does it to an innocent man.
<ul><li> Stabler's the worst example, but he's <em>not</em> the only one: all the main detectives (and the persecution lawyers, occasionally, and the various ADAs) run this trope with a T.
</li></ul></li><li> A first season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em> had Ray beating a Mafia don senseless (after the Mafia don <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">agreed to talk to him in private, in a locked room</a>) and threatening to tell the entire neighborhood about it unless he agreed to stop harassing a local shoemaker that the Mafia don had ordered a hit on for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">stealing a hundred bucks from a church's poor box.</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note348vh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note348vh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note348vh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The shoemaker had resorted to stealing from the poor box because the Mafia don had bled him dry in a protection racket, causing the Shoemaker to lose his business and be abandoned by his family.</span>
<ul><li> Ray made a point of leaving his gun and badge in the car before he went inside to confront the Don, so he wasn't beating the crap out of him as a cop, but as a member of the community (that said, still a cop, still an unlawful beatdown, still counts). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">This had some serious unintended consequences</a> later in the show, eventually resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis's death</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> wherein George Sr. or his twin brother (or one of them disguised as/mistaken for the other) gets tackled by the police and then one officer clubs them on the head. There was also an instance in which George Sr. was captured by Mexican police who were in a vengeful mood on account of a defective product George had knowingly marketed in the country. He fakes his death and has it reported that the police beat him to death — this actually is what probably would have happened had he not satisfied the officers with a legal argument (read: paid them a large bribe).
</li><li> Happened now and then on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS">COPS</a></em>, but of course, it's never acknowledged.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Michael Garibaldi</a> tries to put a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>'s head through a tabletop when he refuses to stop talking trash about Marsies during a period of violence on Mars. It no doubt didn't help that Garibaldi's ex-lover lived on Mars, and he had been unable to find out if she had been harmed in the fighting.
</li><li> Usually, however, Garibaldi (and those reporting to him) avert the trope, particularly when Sheridan has Morden detained indefinitely on unspecified charges:
<div class="indent"><strong>Garibaldi</strong>: "Look, out there I may play it fast and loose, but in here I play it <em>by the book</em>. Now charge him, or cut him loose!"
</div></li><li> Implied to be imminent but averted when the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">treacherous assistant security chief</span> who shot Garibaldi in the back is caught. The security men taking him into custody ask Captain Sheridan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingOutForAQuickCupOfCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingOutForAQuickCupOfCoffee">"take a walk"</a> while they deal with him; Sheridan declines.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, there was a variation on the trope. One of the CSIs slugged a perp, but everyone was ticked off at the guy in general, and Brass calmly said something about not seeing it that way, that the perp attacked the CSI first.
<ul><li> But then averted in a crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em>. Brass stops Agent Malone from roughing up a suspect, telling him that in their house they do things by the book.
</li></ul></li><li> Stella has gotten called for this a couple of times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>. Danny got sent home for it after getting overly rough with a Neo-Nazi suspect (who turned out to be innocent).
</li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, Marty won't stop haranguing Niles's lawyer girlfriend with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">evil lawyer jokes</a>. Finally, after he asks her, "How many lawyers does it take to screw in a light bulb?" she retorts, "How many cops planted it there?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill">The Bill</a></em> started off as a realistic low-level police procedure series, but as time went on, got more and more soap-opera-like and unrealistic. By the end, the easiest way to cut crime in Sun Hill would have been to close down the station and ask the local drug gangs to keep order instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bottom">Bottom</a></em> played this for laughs in an episode where they were exploiting identity parades for cash. At the end of the episode, the character staging the crimes is found out and looks at the camera. Cue the usual random, mindless violence — by Chief Inspector Grobbelaar and his goons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>, Alvin Yood (Prisoner 01Y218) is a former small-town Sheriff jailed for beating a minor who spat on him during an interrogation.

Mulder gets frustrated while he interrogates Roche, a convicted child molester and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>, and he hits him very hard in the jaw. A guard walks in, surprised, but when Roche complains, he says he didn't see it. The fair-minded and just Agent Scully is visibly upset and mad at Mulder but doesn't report him. They have to account for this action, though, because it was videotaped, and their supervisor AD Skinner pulls out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> speech.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Banshee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Banshee">Banshee</a></em>, the townspeople are astounded by how brutal Lucas Hood, the new sheriff, can be toward criminals, but since the local criminals have been running roughshod over the town for years, everyone just figures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a> and shrugs it off.

The UCAS (i.e. the streets) were patrolled by Lonestar (motto: Blam! Blam! "Freeze!" Blam!) until 4th edition, when Knight Errant won the Seattle law enforcement contract; they can be just as brutal, are a subsidiary of Ares Macrotechnology (i.e. the biggest developer of weaponry in the world), and are eager to prove they're more capable and less corrupt than Lonestar (who still run the prisons, and a lot of laid-off Lonestar cops are now working on the other side of the law as Shadowrunners). Each Megacorporation has its own private security force as well — and since corporations make their own law, to them Miranda is just the name of a Hispanic guy. A run against Aztechnology may put you up against Leopard guards (whose brutality is just to tenderize you before the ritual blood sacrifice), while Mitsuhama Computer Technologies pioneered the concept of "Zero Zero" security. "Zero penetration, zero survival."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> mocks this to hell and back. In one episode, Peter finds out that he has black ancestors, and everybody starts treating him differently. When a cop pulls him over for speeding, Peter is perfectly polite, and the cop doesn't act unusually until he remembers that particular little tidbit.
<div class="indent"><strong>Officer:</strong> Are you that white guy who's actually a black guy? <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> Yes. <br/><strong>Officer:</strong> We need backup, stolen vehicle here. <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> But this is my car. <br/><strong>Officer:</strong> Suspect getting belligerent. <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> But I'm not - <br/><strong>Officer:</strong> Officer down!

Lois doesn't get upset at him for it, telling him she had it coming.
</li><li> In another episode, Joe gets a new police cruiser which has a robotic system for painlessly subduing perps and placing them in handcuffs. When Cleveland tries it out — Joe's sudden realization and shouted warning a second too late — a computerized voice yells out that he's resisting and arms come down and start beating him with batons. It goes further, crying out "Look out! He has a gun" and planting evidence.
</li><li> This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> on one occasion, where some LAPD officers are violently beating Peter.

</li><li> In Cool Hand Peter, the gang is arrested on a trip to the South by a corrupt super-racist sheriff who frames them for a broken tail light and drug possession because Cleaveland and Joe showed more integrity than Peter (who was being an asshole but was ignored by the sheriff for being white and healthy). The prison camp they're in is mainly run by the police, and only gives 19th-century technology to the prison workers. Soon after, they brutalize Cleaveland two times after Peter continues to insult them (and whack Peter in the gut for a third). And after they've served their time, the warden extends their sentence indefinitely and responds to their escape with shoot-to-kill orders extending to the police. By the end of the episode, Joe has had enough and brutalizes the Sheriff with the same methods to make it clear that his usual tactics make him a thug hiding behind a badge.
