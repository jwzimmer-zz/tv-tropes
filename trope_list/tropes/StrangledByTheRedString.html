"Amor ex Machina," if you will.
</p><p>Not every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a> gets the luxury of being played out fully to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">last detail</a>. Sometimes the writers decide that the important part is getting those two characters in a relationship, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">the rest will somehow sort itself out</a>. The result is that the two characters go through a leap of characterization all the way to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> without any of the usual in-betweens; apparently Cupid forgot to tie the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate">Red String of Fate</a> on the lovers' pinkies at birth, and in a desperate attempt to save face he ended up garroting them with it in a back alley while he thought the audience wasn't paying attention.
</p><p>Possibly the two characters have had little to no interaction prior to their sudden onset of romantic involvement, or they had, and even plenty, but it was never romantic in nature, and seems to have spontaneously transformed into such without any apparent reason. In more borderline cases, this can happen even when the two characters <em>have</em> shown interest in each other, in some form or another; it's the placement, pacing, and timing that are off. An audience tends to know the kind of emotional process a person goes through when entering a romantic relationship, and will not be happy past a certain line of too little of this process and too much conveniently dramatic payoff.

The subsequent lack of "volume" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a>, in turn, begs for compensation: having characters fall for each other out of nowhere can make any romance come across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>, and hence what often happens is that the writers start firing every possible drama cannon so as to impress upon the viewers that <em>this is important</em> and <em>they should care</em>.

It all looked very forced, starting with Kagura suddenly saying he thinks Mikono and Amata make a lovely couple when one episode ago he was fighting Amata over her and screaming about never giving her up to anyone. It was obvious they did this to get them out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>'s way, but for it to make sense you'd have to forget everything about Kagura and Zessica's whole character and everything that happened before.

In early chapters, Senbei and Midori have an embarrassing stalker/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LustObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LustObject">Lust Object</a> type of relationship and Midori seems mostly oblivious to Senbei's love for her.

They are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> for the rest of the series. This was intentional since the author explicitly stated he doesn't like writing romances. Downplayed in later chapters since Arale/Obotchaman, Taro/Tsururin, and Akane/Tsukutsun have slightly more developed relationships (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that all these relationships were his editor's ideas).
</li><li> Most pairings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> and its continuities (though Gohan/Videl actually averts it, since the two take a while to develop their feelings). A few characters marry and have kids during the series's frequent time skips with little on-screen development. To the author's credit, the reason for the lack of development is because he's stated in interviews that he doesn't care for romance, and most of the couples hook up during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> of several years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel">allowing the readers' imaginations to run wild</a>.
<ul><li> Vegeta and Bulma actually became a fan-favorite relationship partly due to this trope. The romantic competition (poor Yamcha) was dumped so suddenly, and the sudden hook up was so unlikely (they had barely spoken, and he had killed her boyfriend and many of her friends) that it ended up being hilarious, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficFuel">left a lot of space for people to make stuff up</a>. It helps that they didn't actually get legally married — they just hooked up and had a kid together, and it took a while for their relationship to become an actual loving one.

On one end, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate">Blank Slate</a> with no discernible personality to start with that is effectively "maturing" as he experiences life and the war. On the other, a sainted virgin sworn away from romance and with massive responsibilities bearing down on her. Time it takes for Jeanne to start crushing on Sieg, a state she'll be in for the rest of the series: the same episode she meets him in. Granted, Jeanne's personality <em>is</em> being influenced by her human host (though Laeticia herself denies influencing Jeanne's romantic feelings directly), and it takes up to Jeanne's sacrifice before Sieg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">truly begins to understand</a> how he feels about her outside of "friendship" (making it more of a one-sided crush). Jeanne even angsts about her feelings in private and is even pushed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a> where one of the villains points out as a holy maiden she shouldn't be falling for anyone. It's only by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> (where Sieg has spent untold years mulling over the events of the series and his feelings while Jeanne has been trying endlessly to reach him) do both of them finally admit their feelings for each other—but it's still barely elaborated <em>why</em> they have feelings for each other, outside of being the male and female leads.

They spend about twenty minutes in each other's company and suddenly can't live without each other, despite being opposite sides, and Four at least was initially characterised as a borderline psychopath and only got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> later (whereas Lalah at least was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Girl</a>).

</li><li> Amuro and Beltorchika Irma are making out for the third time an episode after meeting, though this is somewhat justified in that Amuro was trying to unconsciously use Beltorchika as an "excuse" to not go into space and relive the utter trauma he was into. In Amuro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">next appearance</a>, he is already with Chan Agi, another girl he barely talks to — apparently, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that didn't let the creators use Beltorchika's character as Amuro's <em>CCA</em> girlfriend. Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> penned a novelization of <em>Char's Counterattack</em> called <em>Beltorchika's Children</em>, which was specifically written to be adapted as a film (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise">Sunrise</a> instead chose to adapt <em>High Streamer</em>, an earlier work of Tomino's); in it, Beltorchika appears in Chan's place and assumes her role, only she is explicitly noted to be pregnant with Amuro's child and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">survives the events of the novel as opposed to Chan in <em>CCA</em> proper</span>.

It can be argued that Lunamaria was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and neither she nor Shinn was thinking straight, but even fans of the pairing dislike how they actually hooked up. Making this somewhat more prickly is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> statement from director Mitsuo Fukuda that their relationship was the only pure one in the whole series, which fans of the other couples took as a giant middle finger.

To resolve this, there is a flashback to one conversation between them in Episode 28 and then the generation ends with the wedding. It does <em>not</em> help either, though, that Asemu and Romary's relationship was already more of a default given than anything else right from the beginning: Their son in the Third Generation, Kio, had been leaked to have Romary's hair color <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">even before the entire series has started airing in the first place</a></em>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> reveals that Sasuke and Sakura ended up married and had a daughter together. Theoretically, this might have made logical sense given the time scale, but from the viewers' perspective, one moment Sasuke was trying to kill Sakura, showing utter indifference for her well-being and openly rejecting her (even invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesSheSeeInHim">What Does She See in Him?</a> on himself), and the next moment he was married to her. Back at the beginning of the series, it was pretty clear that Sakura was crushing on him, but it never came across as genuine love; they never shared a real conversation in the manga, and Sakura's feelings seemed to basically amount to "he's really strong and really hot." By the later parts Sasuke had become so hostile to Sakura that this sudden turn to marriage and offspring was completely unpredictable and impossible to understand unless you were wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">Shipping Goggles</a>.

There are maybe seven or eight episodes in a 154-episode series where they have any significant interaction, and Aki spends the first four of those episodes trying to murder Yusei. Immediately after the last of those four episodes, at which point they've spent less than an hour of real time together, she immediately falls in love with him and the majority of her dialogue becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a>. Even after that, Yusei has more interaction with Kiryu over the course of Crashtown's six episodes than with Aki over the entire series. This one could be justified by Yusei not being comfortable with Aki's interest in and devotion to him when she'd previously been fairly unstable, but it's never brought up, thanks to Aki being severely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>.

In the final episode, there's a scene of each of them looking at each other fondly, in parallel with the other pairs, implying that they're destined for one another. The problem? Most of them have barely interacted over the course of a 146-episode series.

The pairings of Yugo/Rin and Yuto/Ruri straight-up never interact onscreen while not brainwashed, but they at least had some level of prior history and got flashbacks that showed their relationships. And then there's Yuri and Serena, who not only never canonically interacted as far as we know, but were on opposite sides, with the former being an unrepentant psychotic villain! The overall effect reads less as true love sufficient to break dimensional boundaries and more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a> elevating one-sided, barely-there, or nonexistent relationships to that level.

Their efforts lead to Appa, one of the dueling spamasters, trying to grab his spa equipment remote from Jalebi's sticky head when the other spamaster, Amma, sees what's happening.

Especially considering that original creator, Brian K. Vaughan, took a long time to develop Victor and Nico's relationship, from a mistake to a real bond of love, before leaving. What's worse, the girl doesn't even stay with him in the end, so the thing just ended up looking like a messy plan to break up Victor and Nico.

It's downright bizarre that special agent Gale claims Marko was transferred to Alana's prison facility but within 12 hours she had helped him escape and they were on the run. Flashbacks nail down that there was zero chemistry when he called her to his cell (she hit him with her rifle butt to get him to stop yammering about conscientious objection). Shortly afterward she stole his translation rings out of lockup so she could read Heist's interracial romance novel to him. Sometime in the afternoon, he revealed that he was being transferred to another prison and she broke him out.

Thankfully, the relationship was well handled after that point, and it was easier to accept than most examples because neither of them had any romantic chemistry with other characters. The reboot kept them a couple but handled it differently by giving them a relationship built on mutual support and inspiration.

Meanwhile, <em>he</em> just... <em>assumed</em> they'd be together because that's how it had always been!

Meanwhile, Carter was very publicly projecting his expectations and feelings for Shiera onto Kendra, which she made clear she hated. Then she started showing some attraction to Carter because... reasons? Then taken to ridiculous lengths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, where Carter casually insults and rebuffs his best friend in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> moment even for Carter, leading to Kendra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">immediately deciding how hard it is not to love him,</a> just to satisfy the prophecy that they declare their love just before they die in each incarnation, as they die in that very same issue, Kendra's <em>last words</em> being a proclamation of love for Carter.
</li><li> Katar and Shayera <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a>. In <em>Hawkworld</em>, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a> who is frustrated with his society's class system and his people's treatment of other races. So obviously he falls for... Shayera, who publicly torments a servant right in front of him and callously murders what she considers lesser life. There is actually <em>zero</em> reason given for his attraction to her, as it's made clear that her behaviour disgusts him. Unless he just thinks she's hot, but after her death, he plays it up as some significant relationship.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> of the current series is the human Hawkman Carter Hall and the Thanagarian Hawkwoman Shayera Thal. Since theyve spent most of their lives on different planets, they had no personal interactions before she showed up to stop him (briefly possessed by an evil past life) from killing a bunch of people. From that moment on, they and everyone around them simply took it for granted that they were together because they are Hawkman and Hawkwoman. They both speak as if they have a long history together, which, in a sense they do, but it doesnt change the fact that as individuals they had never met up until that point. It actually seems fairly plausible from Carter's side of the relationship, since the series had gone to great pains to show how important Hawkwoman has been to him over their lives together and he is characterised as very world-weary and weighed down by his history and memories, so it makes sense that he would be eager for companionship from the only other person who would understand. However, Shayera was previously in a relationship with the deceased Katar Hol (who is explicitly noted to be one of Carter's previous reincarnations) and when she appeared in <em>Justice League</em> only a few months before joining the series, she was still mourning Katar and had definitely <em>not</em> moved on, as she had created a realistic simulation of him to quell her loneliness. This makes her rushing into a relationship with Carter seem forced, and frankly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">really</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">unhealthy</a>.

You'll hardly find <em>anyone</em> who likes the pairing. They had non-existent chemistry, and it doesn't help that Terry was a sleazy Wolfman look-alike. Or he was ten years older than her. Or he was her college professor. Or Terry's ex-wife predicted he'd divorce Donna because he feels emasculated by her and gets bored easily (which is exactly what eventually happened). Or he took their son away from Donna because she was a "bad" influence...
</li><li> Tim Drake (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> III) and Cassie Sandsmark (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> II) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>. Given the fact that they had a very platonic interaction before the hookup, that Wonder Girl was the girlfriend of Robin's dead best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a>, and the reason they kissed in the first place was due to mutual mourning of said person... yeah, it was definitely a trainwreck. Fans of both Wonder Girl and Robin sighed a collective breath of relief when the pairing didn't go anywhere and was allowed to end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth">Titans (Rebirth)</a></em> has quite a few in <em>one issue</em> no less. One issue focuses almost entirely on the romantic troubles of the team, like a love triangle between Wally West, Donna Troy, and Roy Harper. Wally has shown <em>zero</em> feelings for Donna, but they end up making out because Linda Park "breaks up" with him (they weren't a proper couple anymore) and both understand what it's like to have messed up memories. Rushed, to say the least, but at least logical. The worse offender is Lilith and Garth, who get together because... no reason stated. And they've barely interacted before this issue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">But because Lilith is a psychic, she says she's known that Garth has been hiding his feelings for her</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a> relaunch:
<ul><li> In general, it has quite a few because of its very nature. Because it's a return to DC's roots and a spiritual return to the pre-Flashpoint universe, it has a lot of characters that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> but weren't couples anymore (as a result of <em>Flashpoint</em>) getting back together. The problem is that it rushes them quite a bit because it assumes a level of familiarity with the reader.
</li><li> An example would be Green Arrow and Black Canary suddenly pining for each other after one meeting (where they didn't even speak) in <em>DC Universe: Rebirth</em> #1. Their relationship was expanded upon in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrowRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrowRebirth">Green Arrow (Rebirth)</a></em> series where it made more sense, as the two actually got to know each other, at least.
</li><li> From that same issue, Wally West and Linda Park. It works a little better since Wally explicitly remembers the timeline pre-Flashpoint (though Linda doesn't), but it's still weird for new readers who don't know about the two. He <em>does</em> explain why they fell in love, but it's a case of him telling not showing, as you just can't condense over a hundred issues into a single scene. This version of their relationship was also prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth">Titans (Rebirth)</a></em>, where it ended with the two never becoming a couple like Wally wanted. To say fans are not amused when it comes to the handling of <em>the</em> Flash couple is an understatement.
</li><li> Tim Drake and Stephanie Brown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComicsRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DetectiveComicsRebirth">Detective Comics (Rebirth)</a></em> suffered from the same problem as the above. Many don't like that Tim and Steph were depicted in a relationship together with no prior buildup. James Tynion assumes a lot of familiarity and fondness for the characters and their relationships from the pre-Flashpoint era, and as such <em>lots</em> of the relationships, romantic or not, come across as sudden. Tim and Steph are no exception. Tim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove">Dying Declaration of Love</a> feels hollow for this reason, as does Steph's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">The Mourning After</a> status.

Apparently, somebody knew how it's gonna feel to fans and decided to throw a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>.

It was bad enough that Elizabeth dumped two other boyfriends that she had better chemistry with for Anthony. It was worse that Anthony was still married when they got together for good. It was even worse when Anthony's ex-wife was villainized as a horrible woman for <em>daring</em> to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> and suspecting that Anthony was cheating on her (Even though he <em>was</em>, and even though he promised he'd be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband">House Husband</a> when he convinced Therese to get pregnant, then went back on his word.)

The writer admitted its canon status was sketchy and he mostly just wanted to celebrate the ban on same-sex marriage being unconstitutional. Despite all that, a later fic in the same universe does depict them happily married without much said about how they got there.
<ul><li> Averted after the fact- Cassandra and Sadie's relationship, with all its ups and downs, gets a lot of attention in the story's two sequels. The timeline of events also ends up rendering the marriage proposal chapter non-canon. Though per the author, the later-timeline fic was relegated to an alternate timeline.

Indeed the first words out of Link in the entire story are him calling Jenna beautiful and he asks her out on a date immediately after. Aside from some sex and a few mentions of being sad about Jenna having to leave there is absolutely nothing else between the two between their first date and Link proposing to her. Though the story frequently harps on how perfect the pair are for each other, there's pretty much no actual examples of why they are.

Not much better is when she time-travels back to meet Tom Riddle, whom she immediately hooks up with for very little reason (and while skating over the above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">Triang Relations</a>).

Worse, the author apparently forgets who's paired with whom from time to time.

<ul><li> This is the case with earlier movies, particularly ones like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>. It can be chalked up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> trying to keep to the source material, which in those cases were mostly fairy tales meant to teach morality and not build a believable love story. Later movies fix this, by giving the couples more interaction and personalities beyond "She's the girl of my dreams!". Even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em> the relationship of Ariel and Eric, occurred between two people who did not know each other for more than three days, and she couldn't even speak at first, yet after those three days, they're already getting married.
</li><li> Simba and Nala from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King (1994)</a></em>, to some. As cubs, they don't express any romantic interest in each other and are disgusted by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>. When they find each other again as adults they goof around for a little bit and fall in love within a night. Unless you could argue that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">simply denied their feelings as cubs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">only realized them when they were reunited as adults.</a>
</li><li> A number of fans perceive Anna and Kristoff's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> as such. They do have a fair bit of interaction, but none of them, aside from the "Fixer Upper" song, can be perceived as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> without some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">Shipping Goggles</a>, especially since Anna was still engaged with Hans throughout those scenes, and didn't even realize that Kristoff has feelings for her until Olaf pointed it out in the finale. On the other hand, it's arguable that's the <em>point</em>. Her attraction to Hans was also classically contrived, and we saw how <em>that</em> ended up. As of the end of the film, Anna and Kristoff are merely <em>dating</em>, and they're actually taking their time to see where it goes. Of course, that doesn't stop "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenFever">Frozen Fever</a>" and other works from treating their relationship as <em>fait accompli</em>.
</li><li> Fix It Felix and Sgt Calhoun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>. The film presents Felix and Calhoun's relationship as thus: they meet (and Felix comments on Calhoun's high definition), they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slapstick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slapstick">Slapstick</a> routine that ends with them gazing into each others' eyes (and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">shipped by the Laffy Taffy</a>), Felix calls Calhoun a dynamite gal (which doesn't end well), they share <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a>, and they get married in the epilogue (presumably after a year or so has passed offscreen). That's it. Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> admits they paired the two together because they found it cute/funny (<a class="urllink" href="http://imgonnasketchit.tumblr.com/post/37459144132">and because it was hard to work out Felix's odd proportions without a realistic reference<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), so it could be intentional, in addition to the fact that Ralph and Vanellope's stories were the central focus of the movie. The removal of several <em>Hero's Duty</em> scenes from an earlier scrapped plot meant less screen time for them, which resulted in a few confirmed Felix and Calhoun interactions (and likely Calhoun's formal introduction as well) being omitted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenLittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenLittle">Chicken Little</a></em> at one point features a scene where the eponymous character suddenly decides to tell Abby Mallard that he always thought she was "extremely attractive" (despite her being a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">gonk</a>) and gives her a kiss, much to her delight. The film has absolutely no hints prior to this scene that Chicken Little has a crush on Abby or vice versa.
</li></ul></li><li> In the rather forgettable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheInvincibleIronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheInvincibleIronMan">The Invincible Iron Man</a></em> the romance between Tony and Li Mei suffers from this. Tony and Li Mei are supposed to be madly in love in spite of the fact they never have an actual conversation or ever really have any time together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrangeMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrangeMagic">Strange Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the romance between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Marianne</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">the Bog King</a></span> happens in a course of a few hours, they are shown to be well suited for each other: they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> right from the start, share a distaste for sugary, romantic displays, and bond over their respective heartbreaks. Of course, YMMV on how it works out.
</li><li> Marianne's sister Dawn is broken out of the effects of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a> when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">she realizes she loves</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Sunny</a>, even though she's showed no interest in him at all the entire film except as a friend.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSwanPrincess">The Swan Princess</a></em> clearly tried to avoid this, but didn't quite know how. Odette and Derek are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">being pushed to marry</a> from childhood, but grow up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemies</a> at best. Then they suddenly fall in love as adults upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAllGrownUp">seeing how good-looking the other is</a>. The movie tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruct</a> this part—Odette actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto">calls off the engagement</a> when Derek can't think of anything to compliment but her beauty—but once she gets captured by Rothbart the two act like they're engaged again, their conflict forgotten except for a throwaway line at the very end of the movie.
<ul><li> Some viewers have theorised that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">the pair actually did grow to like each other</a> and were in denial over their feelings until they both grew up. Despite allegedly hating each other, they actually make an effort to spend time together (in particular Odette), some of their passive-aggressive behaviour could be interpreted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>, Derek gets annoyed that she's flirting with castle guards (jealousy, perhaps?) and Brom outright tells teenage Derek that he thinks he likes her really. Of course, the film doesn't really explain this clearly so the aforementioned scene of them falling deeply in love upon sight comes across as a bit jarring.
</li></ul></li><li> Done painfully in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanicTheLegendGoesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanicTheLegendGoesOn">Titanic: The Legend Goes On</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfTheTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfTheTitanic">The Legend of the Titanic</a></em>. The former involves the hero and heroine deciding they were made for each other... after sharing about three sentences. It becomes hilarious when we're shown flashbacks to their meetings... one of which was <em>accidentally bumping into each other</em>. The latter plays this even worse, as the heroine's love interest realizes they are meant to be after <em>sniffing her glove</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths">Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths</a></em>, new character Rose Wilson has a crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>. The Martian inadvertently discovers they're "attuned" when he accidentally reads her thoughts (something he'd never do by accident with a non-attuned person). He then Mind Melds with her so that they can get to know each other instantly and fall completely in love. Martians apparently have no need to date.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thumbelina1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thumbelina1994">Thumbelina</a></em> has a definite example of this trope with respect to the main character and her love interest Prince Cornelius. They only spent one night together flying around in the starlit sky and singing about how much they loved each other. This is made even more poignant when you take into account that the night they did all that was the night they met for the very first time. To be fair, Thumbelina can be excused because she was literally born as a teenager and complains to her mother about how there's nobody else her size and daydreams about meeting someone like the prince in her fairytales, so it's not unbelievable that Thumbelina would be instantly attracted to the first ever person she's met who is compatible with her. Given some throwaway dialogue from Cornelius's parents and how hard he tries to find her over the course of the movie, it seems like fast, intense courtship is common for fairies.
</li><li> Hiccup and Astrid's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon">How to Train Your Dragon</a></em> can be seen as this. In the beginning, it is established that Hiccup has a crush on her, but Astrid spends the first half of the movie either completely ignoring Hiccup or being extremely rude to him, and right before meeting Toothless, she is about to beat him up. Then they go on a ride on Toothless' back and apparently that was all it took for Astrid to realize she likes him back. Although they are confirmed to be a couple in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon2">How to Train Your Dragon 2</a></em>, they don't properly confess their love until the third film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragonTheHiddenWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragonTheHiddenWorld">How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a></em>, which does spend most of its arc developing their relationship and ends on their marriage.
</li><li> Alva and Jesper's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Klaus2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Klaus2019">Klaus (2019)</a></em> has been cited as one of the film's few flaws. In only their <em>second</em> interaction together, Mogens claims that they're in love despite their argument being nothing but vitriol, as if their being a man and a woman who interact instantly means they're a couple. While they spend more time and build chemistry later, the film's insistence makes it feel rather clumsy.

<ul><li> Massimo and Laura's romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundredSixtyFiveDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundredSixtyFiveDays">365 Days</a></em> isn't well developed. Massimo became fixated on Laura after seeing her <em>once</em>, at a distance, five years ago and then decides the best way to win her over is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">kidnap her</a>. Despite Massimo's claims he loves her, he doesn't respect her wishes and is very aggressive towards her. Laura spends half the film being antagonistic towards Massimo, understandly seeing as he kidnapped her, then suddenly decides she wants to have sex with him after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueSex">saves her from drowning</a> (which was technically his fault). After a few months at most, they decide to get married and the film portrays this as them being truly in love, even though their onscreen relationship is mostly based around sex rather an emotional connection.
</li><li> Peter and Gwen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> start off not knowing each other personally and yet hook up in their second scene of extended interaction together, and stay a couple for the rest of the movie. This is fixed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">the sequel</a>, though, and thank goodness, as otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie">the inevitable result of their relationship wouldn't have been as effective</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a> movies are <em>very</em> fond of this trope. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillyMadison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillyMadison">Billy Madison</a></em>, where Veronica quite clearly finds Billy to be both obnoxious and a burden on her as a teacher.

All it took was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Billy faking his own pants incident to rescue another student from being shamed by his classmates. Nevermind that, just a few scenes back, Billy himself shamed another classmate by mocking him for struggling with a reading assignment</span>.

Despite how they don't know each other at all and Mina was engaged with the main character Jonathan, Mina continued to pine over Dracula, continued to calling Dracula "My Prince" even after she got married and seemed to try to foil the heroes' plan to destroy him at times. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess">Hypnotize the Princess</a> is pretty much implied to be involved since Dracula had already started biting her, and thus could easily have her under his spell. On Dracula's end, this is because Mina happened to look like Dracula's old love who committed suicide. Or is it that Mina was a reincarnation of said love? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">This wouldn't make sense since the reason that Dracula became the Dracula is that he renounced God at the thought that his beloved will go to hell for committing suicide.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">But then the ending showed that Dracula and his old love went to heaven</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">ARRRGHHH!!!!</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Closer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Closer">Closer</a></em> does this with its pairings, thanks to multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">times skips</a> that don't fill in the blanks. Dan decides he's in love with Anna after one kiss. Anna gives Dan the brush-off...but the next scene has them confessing to their respective partners that they've been having an affair for over a year. Anna reassures Dan of her love for him despite having slept with Larry...the next scene reveals that she went back to Larry. Alice rebuffs Larry...but Larry is later seen taunting Dan about having slept with her. Dan is depressed over Anna leaving him...the next scene is of him and Alice in bed, having reconciled and all we get to explain this is a brief flashback of him tracking her down at the strip club. It gets jarring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Enchanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Enchanted">Enchanted</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a> is worse than other examples because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>. After mocking Love At First Sight for the whole movie, Nancy runs off with Edward to the animated world the same night that she meets him. It seems that true love <em>does</em> come as fast as fairy tales suggest it does, after all — if you live in a Disney movie. It's more understandable if you see a deleted scene that paints Nancy as a jaded romanticist who's given up on meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming">Prince Charming</a> but it's still jarring. Notice that the live action Giselle and Robert appear to spend weeks or even months together building their relationship and her career, while animated Nancy and Edward are getting married before her cell phone has completely run out of charge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourWeddingsAndAFuneral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></em>. Charles and Carrie sleep together after the first wedding. The next time they see each other is at the second wedding, three months later, when they have sex again, despite her now being engaged. Several more months go by before their next encounter, probably the first thing close to a proper date that they've had, even though he's helping her choose a wedding dress—and this is when he declares his love for her. There's zero interaction between them at the third wedding (hers), a brief one at the funeral, and when she shows up at the fourth wedding (his), despite there having been sufficient time for him to get over her (ten months), he ditches his fianceé at the altar. That's a total of FIVE times he's ever laid eyes on this woman, but it's enough for him to decide that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films, mainly due to their being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptations</a>, definitely lean towards the asphyxiatory side of things in regards to Harry and Ginny. The two barely interact, sharing the screen for about seven minutes combined in the last <em>three movies</em>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">fifth book</a>, Ginny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">being able to speak to Harry</a> was a big deal; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">fifth movie</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BonnieWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BonnieWright">Bonnie Wright</a> barely has any lines. Whenever they are on screen together, they barely talk, instead just sharing a kiss and an awkward look before Harry rushes off to do something and Ginny sits down to be irrelevant to the plot.

Number Four falls in love with Sarah within two days and apparently <em>permanently.</em> There's a long scene of overly-flowery declarations of love delivered in a manner that would make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Padme and Anakin</a></em> cringe. It's telling about this trope in general: apparently, the creators considered the way romance works in movies to be so nonsensical that it needed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>... yet so obligatory that saying "no, they can have the first date at the end of this movie and be the love of each other's lives by movie three" wasn't an option.

It's especially bad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em>, where Bond and Dr. Christmas Jones have absolutely zero romantic interaction or flirtation before he beds her at the end of the film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">In the novels</a> this makes much more sense, as Bond is a philanderer and pretty misogynistic on top of it, rarely feeling much for the women he has sex with; the problem is that the films keep trying to present meaningless flings as genuine romances.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKissingBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKissingBooth">The Kissing Booth</a></em>, Rachel shows up out of nowhere after Lee is stood up at the Kissing Booth in front of everyone, tells him that she 'hopes he likes what he sees' after she kisses him and takes off his blindfold - implying that she's had a crush on him for a while - and they immediately begin dating for the rest of the movie. This is the first time Rachel's character appears, without any foreshadowing or build-up to her crush on Lee. He also immediately reciprocates despite the fact they'd apparently never even interacted prior to this and he'd spent a chunk of the movie crushing on Mia.

It's elaborated on in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">the book</a>, but in the unextended movie version, it's all rather sudden... Thankfully the filmmakers chose to play it subtle, so it's not <em>as</em> bad as other examples here.
<ul><li> For some reason, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">pair up</a>, or at least heavily imply in the direction of, Gandalf and Galadriel. This is despite the latter not even being in the original book — not to mention, <em>already married.</em> There's almost no development to explaining why these two seem to love each other, or even how that's possible, considering the idea of Gandalf being romantically involved with <em>anyone</em> would come as a massive surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>, this seems to be a widely held opinion on the romance between Thor and Jane Foster, which really only serves to give Thor a reason to want to get back to Earth. Some have even labeled it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>, which is kind of funny considering that the same thing was said about the character played by Jane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">actress</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KennethBranagh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KennethBranagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> must have realized this and says in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> that their relationship wasn't meant to be true love, but more a mutual crush and respect. It gets worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>. They've been pining for each other for the <em>two whole years</em> since. Once reunited, this movie proceeds to pretend they were madly in love throughout the last and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a> interaction is <em>incredibly</em> jarring when they've never been <em>anything</em> like that before. Part of one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stingers</a> at the end even starts with Jane looking all miserable <em>again</em> as if two days without him is hell on earth. However, the writers apparently got the picture in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>, when it's revealed in dialogue that Thor and Jane broke up. Their actors, Portman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisHemsworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisHemsworth">Hemsworth</a>, also didnt have very good chemistry. The only kissing scene between them (end of the second movie) that's really believable isn't even them. It was Portman's day off, and they asked Hemsworth's wife Elsa Pataky when she stopped by to be her stand in.
</li><li> Pre-release, this was feared with the teasing of the Black Widow/Bruce Banner romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>. After release, given it's Widow's major story arc in the movie, both critics and fans were divided on how it was handled. A big factor in this is that at least an hour of footage was cut from the movie (which is <em>still</em> 2 1/2 hours long), which makes much of their romance (and the rest of the plot) seem to just lurch from event to event without any proper build-up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em>, Hope spends most of the movie resenting Scott over the fact that her father Hank chose some random ex-con as his successor and not his own daughter, and her interactions with Scott are hostile as she begrudgingly trains him. But near the end of the movie, as he grows into his role as Ant-Man, she slowly starts respecting him and they work together. You would think that she only just now started liking him <em>as a person</em>, but at the end of the movie, Hank walks in on them making out and suddenly they're now an item. Though for what it's worth, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntManAndTheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntManAndTheWasp">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a></em> did do a good job showing them function as a steady couple, which is not the MCU's strong point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em> Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter share a kiss before the action of the movie kicks into gear. Most fans found the whole thing baffling, as while they have occasionally hooked up in the comics, Sharon was little more than an extra in the prior film and didn't have too much to do in <em>Civil War</em>, either, on top of the rather weird implications of Steve hooking up with his old girlfriend's descendant (and mere days after learning she died, on top of that). On top of that, it's Sharon's last speaking appearance to date in the films, which makes the whole thing feel rather pointless.

Ned unexpectedly hooks up with fellow student Betty Brant, neither of them having been interested in each other before and then suddenly passionately flirting in the span of a single plane ride. They continue to be eerily invested in each other throughout the whole field trip, much to Peter's disbelief. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then when the students all get back home, Ned and Betty broke up offscreen during the return plane ride, and are already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicableExes">Amicable Exes</a>.

They know each other for a few days and barely interact. When they do interact, they talk about kung-fu and machines. Then at the very end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">the first movie</a>, she spontaneously declares her love for Neo despite no build-up, other than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, earlier in the movie about the Oracle's prediction.

Brian finds her attractive, and Judith is upset when he is captured by the Romans, but not in a way that implies that she sees him as something more than a fellow rebel. Then they meet in the desert, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot">the next shot</a> is them waking up in bed together.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a> movies have Kitana and Liu Kang. While it is established in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombat">first film</a> that Liu is attracted to Kitana when they first make eye contact, there are only three scenes of spoken expository dialogue between the two before the end of the movie shows them returning to Earth arms linked as a couple. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">sequel</a>, Liu and Kitana act like they've been a couple for years despite the events of the sequel taking place immediately after the end of the first film. When Jade attempts to tempt Liu Kang as part of a test of character, he refuses her advances claiming his heart belongs to Kitana. This is despite him barely knowing Kitana more than he knows Jade.

A major part of the movie's plot revolves around her falling in love with him, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turning evil after she thinks he's betrayed her</span>. But this falls short when you realize that Oscar and Theodora have only known each other for a day or two before he leaves the Emerald City and they don't see each other again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a></span>. Despite this, she's already talking about how she'll be his queen and they'll rule Oz together, and completely breaks down when she thinks he's cheating on her. It's also not entirely clear how far their relationship went to begin with and whether they actually slept together or not, which can make Theodora come off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePirateMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePirateMovie">The Pirate Movie</a></em>, when Mabel arbitrarily grabs Pirates and Daughters and throws them together, with even the last two male pirates getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">stuck together</a> with suitably shocked expressions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pixels">Pixels</a></em>, Violet falls in love with the main character Sam Brenner, despite him acting like a creep (checking her out when he's supposed to do his job, making comments about her masturbating) and being a loser. It's also fairly abrupt how fast she goes from hating him to being willing to talk about personal issues like her recent divorce.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceCaspian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceCaspian">Prince Caspian</a></em>, Caspian and Susan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">become a couple</a> for five minutes at the end of the movie because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">he rescued her once from some soldiers</a>. Suddenly at the end, the two are snogging in front of a crowd, only for their relationship to end five seconds later when Susan and her siblings return through the portal to England, meaning she and Caspian will never see each other again. Thus, there was no reason to include their romance in the first place because it was doomed to end anyway.

Almost all of their relationship development happens in the prologue when Buttercup realizes that the local farmboy is in love with her, and then they kiss. In the rest of the movie, they're separated for all but two scenes (and they spend most of those scenes bickering), and the entire plot is driven by their true love and their need to be back together. This is pretty much in-line with how the genre tends to have the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">Take Our Word for It</a> that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect">the hero's true love and primary motivation</a>, further suggested in that Westley and Buttercup exclusively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">describe each other's physical appearance</a> when speaking of each other. Weirdly, the actors are so passionate and sincere that they mostly manage to sell the romance anyway. The book even joked that their relationship would probably run into troubles if either of them ever aged out of their good looks.

Granted, they went through some very rough stuff together, but it's entirely possible for two kids to go through a bad time and not fall in love.

Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> thought this was enough and that their relationship didn't actually need to be convincing.

After leaving Tatooine, the <em>only</em> interaction the two are shown having is a brief scene on Coruscant where they exchange a few lines of dialogue, and he <em>doesn't even know it's her</em>.

You can say that's just pure physical attraction speaking (Anakin is canonically a teenager at this point after all), but that wouldn't explain why he seems so singularly obsessed with her when as a Jedi he's surely seen and met <em>many</em> attractive women throughout his interstellar adventures or even just in the temple (human or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">no</a>). Their romance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">dominates the movie</a> and distracts from the more important war and political aspects due to the completely unnecessary decision for it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Love</a> story (despite the original trilogy and Episode I making no mention of it being forbidden for Jedi to be in relationships, and this film not actually giving a reason other than "it's not the Jedi way" and "I'm a senator"). And Padme does a complete 180 from "We can't be together" to "Let's be together", with the only important conversation they had in the interim being Anakin confessing that he <em>murdered children</em>.

Of course, given that the entire novel is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, the forced nature of this ending may well be intentional.

However, there has been nothing vaguely romantic in their interactions up to that point — which is odd, because there was a blossoming awkward romance between Jeremy and Myria<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Unity</span>, and Susan was quite taken with the idea of "someone like her" throughout the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the short story "Love Hurts", Harry Dresden and Karrin Murphy (who are good friends) investigate a double murder where the victim and perpetrators had this trope happen due to mind control magic. Later in the story, they also find this happening to themselves.
</li><li> More subtly, the main novels have a brief story arc where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anastasia Luccio</span> falls in love with and starts dating Harry. At the end of "Turn Coat", we find this trope applies to poor Harry's love with that woman, because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a conspiracy to weaken the White Council through mind control</span> so it makes perfect sense. So the Red String had a good an in-universe reason. They break off the relationship simply because fate/magic was part of it, and trying to figure out how much was giving them both headaches and kind of freaking them out.
</li></ul></li><li> The general pattern of romance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> series is: "one character suddenly thinks it's fate to marry another character they barely know, the other character thinks they're rude, and suddenly they're married."
<ul><li> Ender and Novinia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpeakerForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpeakerForTheDead">Speaker for the Dead</a></em>. Ender feels a kinship with a teenage Novinia he has never met, but when they meet in person, she is a bitter woman in her late 30s and everything Ender does enrages her. In the concluding chapter, they get married. Made worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, where the couple is seen 30 years later after they have drifted apart. She then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leaves him to move into a monastery</span>. We never see them interact in any way that suggests that they actually like each other.
</li><li> Bean and Petra's relationship in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow">Ender's Shadow</a></em> side series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">relies more on exposition than on action</a>. In the previous book, their interactions are akin to brother and sister, with Petra being rather bossy toward him and Bean trying to prove he can take care of himself. In the second book, Petra comes to realize (via internal monologue) that she likes Bean, but at that point in the book, she hasn't seen him for about a year and merely has a vague hope he might be coming to rescue her. In the third book, she suddenly gets really desperate to have his kids <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he's got a condition that will spell his death by his late teens</span> and we don't see much reason why Bean is any interested in her. Then when the two are separated forever, she suddenly finds out Peter is in love with her and the story flashes-forward to them married for no reason other than keeping her married at the end. Worse is that both marriages came at the expense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">sinking the fairly popular ship</a> of Petra and Dink Meeker from the first book, which ends up just getting a paragraph of exposition about how the two drifted apart.
</li><li> In <em>Xenocide</em>, Wang-Mu idolizes the long-dead-by-<em>millennia</em> Hegemon Peter and at the end of the book gets the unexpected offer to embark on an adventure with a clone of him. Over the course of three days, she grows jealous of the AI he communicates with, even though said AI's life is on the line. She also doesn't pay much attention to the Peter clone admitting at the start that he's not actually like the long-deceased Peter and more akin to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> version with exaggerated ambition and sociopathy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>, Anastasia and Christian barely like each other and can hardly have a civil conversation, yet we're supposed to buy that they can't live without each other.
</li><li> Something of an in-universe example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FirebirdTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FirebirdTrilogy">Firebird Trilogy</a></em>. Near the start of the story, Brenden Caldwell needs to perform a deep-access mental interrogation on Firebird Angelo. Since Firebird and Brenden are heavily connatural, such a deep mental connection causes them to both fall in love almost instantly, and they get married after only a handful more meetings. This looks <em>very</em> bizarre to outsiders, and even the telepathic Sentinels find it a bit odd (Sentinels marry quickly, but usually there's <em>some</em> build-up before they attempt a connaturality probe to see if they're suited for each other).
</li><li> Nearly every romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> has no buildup or development whatsoever; the only exception is Caffran/Criid, and their buildup largely consisted of the two almost killing each other. Probably intentional, as it's implied that the characters don't have particularly strong feelings for each other and are just finding comfort where they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWereDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWereDying">because they know they could die soon</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em>, Newt and Anathema's relationship is predicted by Anathema's long-dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">Seer</a> ancestor to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustNotDieAVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustNotDieAVirgin">one-time hook-up</a> just before the apocalypse. Since Anathema's known about the prophecy all her life, she's somewhat disappointed by the reality of Newt when they do meet, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDo">They Do</a> anyway. Although there's nothing keeping them together after the apocalypse is averted that same day, they immediately settle into a vague, undefined relationship, and a purposely delayed prophecy delivered to Newt implies that they'll eventually get married.
</li><li> The romantic storyline between Karigan and Zachary in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenRider">Green Rider</a></em> can come off a bit like this. Most of the first book is made up of Karigan just trying to reach the capital city. They interact a fair bit in the rest of the book and sporadically over the course of the series, but with the exception of maybe one conversation, all their talk is business rather than conversational or personal. Though an attraction between them is understandable (they're both rather impressive), it's easy not to see a 'chemistry' (let alone a relationship) when they only ever talk to each other like business colleagues, and spend far more time thinking about how much they love each other than they do in each others' actual company.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Whether or not the books did this with the Harry/Ginny pairing is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">major point of debate</a> for fans of the series. Ginny starts off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> fangirl but evolves into a hotheaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, with a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> done to make her look better. Harry becomes closer to and gains a romantic interest in her over the course of two summers which are never properly fleshed out so the development can look rather forced or random to readers.
</li><li> Lupin and Tonks. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">The Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, Harry sees Tonks upset several times and thinks it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">over Sirius dying</span>, and that maybe she was even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">in love with him</a>. Then the climax reveals that Tonks is deeply in love with and wants to marry Lupin. They proceed to do so despite having no interaction on camera before this. As the books are primarily written from Harry's perspective, it's somewhat understandable that plenty of major events can happen off-camera simply because Harry can't be present for every single storyline. At the same time, the reader can still feel left out as the key parts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a> never actually happen in front of <em>them</em> either.

As the series goes on, the concept is increasingly deconstructed: <em>Winds of Fury</em> contains an entire scene in which the spirit of Bard Stefen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note698d2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note698d2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note698d2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Vanyel's lifebonded partner from The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastHeraldMageTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastHeraldMageTrilogy">Last Herald-Mage Trilogy</a></span> explains to the trilogy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Beta Couple</a> his well-supported theory that lifebonding primarily occurs between someone very powerful but emotionally unstable and someone more steady who can provide their lifebonded partner with the emotional grounding and stability they desperately need to keep them sane. As Stef advises from personal experience, the fact that one half of a lifebond is likely to be incredibly broken, this generally leads to an intense and angsty relationship <em>far</em> from the ultimate ideal of romantic love that many people in the setting mistakenly make lifebonds out to be. In the next trilogy, another character's obsession with forming a lifebond is rightfully presented as unhealthy and makes other characters uncomfortable; the general impression created by the narrative is that lifebonds are less about the depth of a couple's feelings for each other and more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a> which the vast majority of people are quite fine without, thank you.

This spawns a meta example as well, as this means the pair pine after each other from the beginning of the series before the readers get to learn anything about their individual personalities or potential dynamic, leading to them jumping headfirst into a real relationship when they do meet.

The two are hardly shown together and for all Vee fawns over him as the "perfect" boyfriend, there's precious little on them actually having anything in common. Vee repeatedly states that she thinks that Patch is a jerk and a potential murderer but isn't the least bit concerned about the fact that <em>he</em> introduced her to Rixon (and that Rixon is Patch's best and possibly only friend). Vee seems quite certain that he's a "boyscout", despite that he more or less lives in a very nasty bar and is not exactly shy about dropping crude innuendos towards Nora. That could be chalked up to Vee being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a>, except that Nora also thinks that Rixon is "cool" and sees no problem with them dating, even though she knows that Rixon is a fallen angel who possesses a Nephilim for two weeks out of every year for sex (with said Nephilim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">being conscious for it all</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact that Patch hooked Rixon up with Vee as a response to suspecting that Rixon was murderous just raises even more eyebrows.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInheritanceCycle">The Inheritance Cycle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some people felt this way about Arya and Eragon's relationship, especially in <em>Inheritance</em>. Eragon is immediately attracted to her and isn't subtle about his feelings in <em>Eldest</em>, only for Arya to completely dismiss them. She makes some good points; she and Eragon barely know each other, she is <em>decades</em> older than him and Eragon's feelings for her come across as a childish crush more than genuine love, considering he's only sixteen when they meet, she's the first woman he's ever noticed romantically, his tendencies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">over-idealize her</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectionAffection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectionAffection">stubborn refusal</a> to accept her rejection. However, starting in <em>Brisingr</em>, Arya suddenly decides she finds Eragon attractive after all, despite everything she said in <em>Eldest</em> and it seeming rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a>. By the end of the series, they're portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">Starcrossed Lovers</a>  to the point of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> exchanging their true names</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hrdb');"><sup>spoiler </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hrdb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hrdb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is a <em>big</em> deal, as knowing someone's true name can give you complete power over them </span>  with little explanation for how and why Arya's feelings changed so rapidly. Arya even says she'd consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait">waiting for Eragon until he's older</a>, which some readers found kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicky</a> more than anything. Others felt it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax">just didn't live up to Angela's prophecy that Eragon would have an "epic romance"</a>, seeing as the entire relationship amounts to a teenage boy having a one-sided infatuation with an older woman, who decides at the last minute 'Well, we could <em>maybe</em> hook up once you're old enough to buy alcohol and vote'. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Paolini</a> has stated that if he writes a fifth book, he will explore their relationship further, but within the published books, the romance falls a bit flat for several readers.
</li><li> Saphira and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Firnen</span> have it even worse. Though admittedly, it's unclear how exactly dragon relationships work in comparison to humans and elves, it still comes across as rather weird and out-of-left-field when Saphira hooks up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Firnen</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">last few chapters</a> of <em>Inheritance</em>. At this point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Firnen</span> is only a few <em>months</em> old and they've known each other for about as long.
</li></ul></li><li> Deconstructed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraHambly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraHambly">Barbara Hambly</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLadiesOfMandrigyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLadiesOfMandrigyn">The Ladies of Mandrigyn</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fawn, after taking off with Starhawk to try to find Sun Wolf, cuts out to marry Orris Farstep. She makes it clear that it's still Sun Wolf, not Orris, she loves; it's just that she knows that it wouldn't work out with Sun Wolf, while it <em>could</em> with Orris.</span>
</li><li> This is noted in-universe in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty Norville</a></em> series. Kitty and Ben were platonic friends for a while, but once he got forcibly turned into a werewolf, her own wolf side formed an intensely close bond with him and they got married shortly thereafter. Kitty quickly ends up realizing that despite the intensity of their feelings for each other, they don't actually know each other that well and the two of them work to build a more meaningful relationship with each other.
</li><li> The relationship between Eowyn and Faramir in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> can seem like this, or at the very least, wedged-in. The truth is that Tolkien initially intended Eowyn and <em>Aragorn</em> to be together — then believed they wouldn't be a good match as Aragorn was "too old and lordly and grim", so he backtracked and created Arwen, later joining Eowyn to Faramir. Tolkien's notes show this was plainly an afterthought. That said, romances in wartime are hardly unheard of, so the relationship isnt totally unbelievable.
</li><li> <em>The Magicians and Mrs. Quent</em> — Ivy's marriage to Mr. Quent is a textbook example. The first half of the book is taken up by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> between Ivy and Mr. Rafferdy, which took time to develop their characters; then, Ivy meets Mr. Quent, hates him, argues with him, and all of a sudden they decide they love each other and get married. Apparently, he's "right for her" in a way that Rafferdy never was, for reasons completely lost on the reader.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em> is <em>quite</em> bad at this. Characters will be madly in love after having only known each other for a few days, or after only a few brief meetings. Unfortunately, this more often than not leaves the reader somewhat confused. A few examples among the main cast include:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GardensOfTheMoon">Gardens of the Moon</a></em>, Ganoes Paran and Tattersail go from having known each other for a few days, the majority of which Paran was unconscious, to having passionate sex. Then Tattersail <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes off and dies</span>, and Paran spends the next two books pining after her.
</li><li> The same book has Crokus Younghand and Apsalar, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka Sorry</span>. They meet, have a few awkward conversations, and then Crokus is ready to leave his whole life behind to help Apsalar go back home. It develops into a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>, where until the end of the series it is not clear why or how they are in love — they just are.
</li><li> The third volume, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce">Memories of Ice</a></em>, has Sergeant Whiskeyjack (a human man) and Korlat (a millennia-old Tiste Andii), who fall in love and hook up without any explanation after meeting for the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightTides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MidnightTides">Midnight Tides</a></em>, the fifth volume, gives us Trull Sengar and Seren Pedac. They meet about twice, for a few minutes each time, and then Trull does the Tiste Edur equivalent of proposing to her. She accepts, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about each other and have barely had a conversation between them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> An explanation <em>can</em> be found if one accepts that Seren is a latent mage and manipulates people's minds without being aware of it — and she admits to herself upon seeing Trull for the first time that she is attracted to him.</span> However, even that is barely implied.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReapersGale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReapersGale">Reaper's Gale</a></em> has Tehol Beddict and Janath Anar, who used to be Tehol's university professor. The fact that they know each other is not even mentioned until Bugg brings Janath home, and even then, all they do is bicker. By the next time they appear, in <em>Dust of Dreams</em>, they are married.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Dust of Dreams</em>, the ninth volume, there's Brys Beddict and Aranict, who at least admits to only have joined the army because she lusted after Brys. However, they share maybe two conversations during the entire book, in one of which Aranict flat-out faints. By the next book, they are a couple and deeply in love.
</li><li> The same book has Henar Vygulf and Lostara Yil, the latter barely recovering from her previous strangled by the red string encounter with the assassin Pearl, who are instantly in love after their first meeting. So in love, in fact, that Lostara does a Shadow Dance to protect Vygulf when he's in danger, something she's never done before in the series. A damn god even comments about how much in love they are. It's especially jarring since, by their own admissions, they know almost nothing about each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em> started out with just the gentlest of implied romance between Max and Fang, focusing mainly on an intricate plot revolving around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad scientists</a> who created them. Then <em>The Final Warning</em> hit, the plot disappeared, and suddenly they were all over each other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">all the time</a>. The fandom was thrilled for the most part... except for those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">realized</a> that these two characters were, for all intents and purposes, brother and sister...
</li><li> The early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> novels have this with Anton and Svetlana. It seems the only reason they're together is that Gesar says so. In fact, Svetlana is frustrated that Anton seems to be taking the fact that they're going to end up together for granted, culminating in her having a threesome with two of his colleagues during a weekend getaway with Anton in the next room. When he finds out that truth, his calm acceptance and brushing off of this infuriates her, further pointing out how he doesn't care about it because their future together is set. It's pointed out, however, that Anton's big problem is Svetlana's power level, which is far above his. Historically, such relationships haven't lasted among Others. Their relationship is temporarily salvaged, when Svetlana is drained by the Mirror, making them more or less even. In later novels, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and raising a daughter, especially after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anton is boosted to Svetlana's power level</span>. It's not clear what will happen after <em>Sixth Watch</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anton is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> permanently, meaning Svetlana will outlive him by centuries</span>.
</li><li> Done quite intentionally in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWorld">Night World</a></em> series. Everyone has a soulmate, and you are meant for each other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">no debate</a>. The first book actually gives us two characters who have been friends for a while and been mutually building a relationship, but later books give us characters who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruct</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstruct</a> the idea of soulmates: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Ash and Mary-Lynette,</a> for example, act completely out of character around each other... because the feelings are entirely new and spontaneous towards a <em>stranger</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They get over it, mostly. And Ash becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> so he can deserve her.</span>
</li><li> Beka and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Farmer</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper">Beka Cooper</a></em>. About 400 pages of no romantic hints... and then suddenly she notices what broad shoulders he has. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're declaring their love for each other and promising marriage while they're in a jail cell, after being tortured, and at a time when Beka <em>still</em> doesn't know for sure who the group traitor is</span>.
</li><li> Played with in-universe for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRavenCycle">The Raven Cycle</a></em> heroine Blue. Growing up in a family full of psychics, she's been told the same prophecy about her true love for years. She gets pretty sick of it to the point that when she does meet the person who's supposedly her true love, she basically says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and decides to pursue the boy she actually likes instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not that this works out entirely, but she gets points for trying.</span>
</li><li> Zayn second relationship in Katharine Kerr's <em>Snare</em>. The other, presumably main, relationship Zayn had got pages and pages of mutual attraction and affection before they hooked up, spread over several weeks. This one had a bare paragraph explaining (not showing, explaining) that they were now friends. Next thing you know someone suggests that they're in love. Zayn is initially horrified and is rather surprised at the whole concept of homosexuality. A few days later, yep, confirmed, they're in love.
</li><li> Moon and BZ Guindhalinu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueenSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueenSeries">The Snow Queen Series</a></em>. In <em>The Snow Queen</em>, Moon goes through a lot of travails to find and rescue her childhood sweetheart Sparks. During her journey, she is captured and imprisoned with another man, BZ, who comes to fall in love with her. After they escape, Moon and BZ sleep with each other once, which cements BZ's love for her, but her heart still belongs to Sparks. At book's end, Sparks is rescued and BZ leaves the planet, believing he can never return to his true love ever again. Then come the sequel <em>The Summer Queen</em>, Moon is shown pining after BZ based on their <em>single moment of sleeping together</em>. The vast majority of the <em>950-page book</em> is spent showing BZ and Moon pining, reuniting, and forming a romantic relationship that, as far as readers can tell, exists solely because they are good in bed. Other characters over the course of the series fall in love at the drop of a hat because of good looks and/or good sex, but to watch the main characters fall in love without any good rationalization outside of "We once had hot passionate sex 18+ years ago" is infuriating.
</li><li> Jon-Tom and Talea's relationship is handled this way in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spellsinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spellsinger">Spellsinger</a></em> novels. They meet in the first novel and go on an adventure together. Then they spend two novels without seeing each other while Jon-Tom moons over her. They finally meet up again in the fifth novel, approximately two or three years later. Talea admits that she's got feelings for Jon-Tom. In the time-skip between the fifth and sixth novels, they get married.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardoc">Stardoc</a></em> series has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cherijo and Duncan, Dhreen and Ilona, and Squilyp and Garphawayn</span>; <em>Blade Dancer</em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jory and Kol</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em>:
<ul><li> In spin-off <em>Sweet Valley Confidential</em>, Elizabeth is estranged from her family after discovering that Jessica and Todd were having an affair behind her back. In the original books, what was considered canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">varied</a> due to changes between different ghostwriters, but generally Jessica found Todd boring and he thought of her as irresponsible and childish. <em>Confidential</em> retconned past events so that Jessica and Todd had been seeing each other secretly ever since college, where they became madly attracted to each other after Jessica agreed to pose as Elizabeth and go as Todd's date to a party. They spend the book trying to reconcile with Elizabeth and regretful at what they've done to her, yet agreeing that their love is so strong it can't be denied. There's no real explanation as to what they see in each other (beyond Jessica thinking while drunk that Todd is better than her many failed past relationships), nor why their bond is supposed to be so strong. By the follow-up series <em>The Sweet Life</em> they are having problems in their marriage and their two-year-old son is torn between them, yet we're again told their love is strong enough to make it through the odds.
</li><li> Also in <em>Sweet Valley Confidential</em>, Steven Wakefield comes out as gay and leaves his wife for Aaron Dallas. Like Jessica and Todd, they fight against the odds for their love and we're told they are soul mates, yet there's no explanation of the relationship, with the book suggesting that they're attracted to each other just because they are the two designated queer characters (going so far as to claim Aaron "became" gay by moving to San Francisco).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDekker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDekker">Ted Dekker</a> does this in all of his later books, and some of his earlier ones. <em>Immanuel's Veins</em> was a vampire romance novel, which was depressing when you compare it to some of his original works like the Circle series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thr3e" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thr3e">Thr3e</a></em>. <em>Obsessed</em> was from the very start a man ferociously in love with some girl he had never met or seen. Even in some of his books that give relationships more time to build up, it's less talking about why his main character loves a woman and more about how intense his love is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> has this both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> with the concept of "imprinting", which means this can be done to werewolves as soon as the plot demands (arguably, all the examples in book 3 were only to prepare the reader for the last one), and out-of-universe with Bella and Edward's relationship. Edward acts surly and moody toward Bella for the first half of the book, and yet Bella decides that she's "unconditionally and irrevocably in love with [Edward]" <em>right after she realizes that he's a vampire who thirsts after her blood</em>, and is completely devoted to him from that point on, even in the face of Edward's own warnings about how he could <em>kill</em> her. Just how devoted is she? She's willing to give up her human life without any second thoughts to be with him forever after what can't be any more than a month of knowing him and instantly leaps back into his arms after he renders her <em>practically comatose</em> by leaving her without explanation. <em>And</em> her interactions with Edward after the vampire "reveal" consist almost entirely of them repeatedly professing their love to one another and her even more repeatedly being "dazzled" by Edward's glorious beauty. To put it a little more into focus Bella's other love interest was made to be more of a boorish jerk in the third book when fans read the second book and a lot of them hoped Bella ended up with him instead, because the two of them had much better chemistry than Bella and Edward, the guy the author wanted her to be in a pairing with.
</li><li> Likewise, in the <em>The Short Second Life Of Bree Tanner</em>, with Bree and Diego and, later, Freddie. Bree and Diego interact for one night, she spends most of it afraid that he's going to kill her, and by morning they seemingly are madly in love with each other. The same goes for Freddie. Since it's from Bree's point of view and the "relationships" between her and the guys are so muted, it's possible that we're supposed to see it as her mistaking simple friendship for love (which would fit with her background of being abused and neglected), except that nothing ever indicates this and she acts almost exactly the same way Bella does, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being perfectly alright to die when she finds out he's gone, because life without him isn't worth living</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Thursday Next</a></em> series does this intentionally: Thursday and Landen get a small subplot of how they get together in the first book but were already basically in love before the series starts without much ado. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperFforde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasperFforde">Jasper Fforde</a> admitted to doing this to get all the romantic stuff out of the way and be able to concentrate on the real story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Half Moon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or Stoneteller</span> and Jayfeather<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Jay's Wing</span>. They've only met twice, once in <em>Long Shadows</em> and again in <em>Sign of the Moon</em>, and bam, Jayfeather has feelings for her. It's a bit of a jarring change, especially since it implies a bit of hypocrisy because he was angry at his mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leafpool, for falling in love as a medicine cat</span>. Watch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> fandom get up in arms over whether they're a super cute pairing that brought tears to their eyes or whether their love is too cheesy and Half Moon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interest</a>, and cue the Jayfeather/Cinderheart, Jayfeather/Willowshine, Jayfeather/Briarlight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoShip">Jayfeather/Stick</a>, Jayfeather/Anyone but Half Moon shippers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">bashing Half-Moon six ways to Sunday</a>.
</li><li> Bluestar and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oakheart</span> have similar problems. They hardly meet at all up until he is suddenly begging Bluestar (then Bluefur) to meet at Fourtrees. Up until this point, Bluestar <em>hated</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oakheart</span> for months (though this was clearly intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>) and had only recently developed a crush on him. They then spend <em>one night</em> together, which ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bluestar getting pregnant.</span> And all this is later painted as a great tragic love story.
</li><li> It's a running problem with cross-Clan relationships in <em>Warriors</em>. In addition to the above example, Crowfeather and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leafpool</span> really get this as well. They jump from acquaintances to in love before you could say 'mouse'. Next thing you know, they're running away together, and just like Bluestar and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oakheart</span> they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get pregnant from a one-night stand</span>.

The two become friends but not much is shown about their relationship because Spottedleaf is murdered in the <em>first book</em> of series. Spottedleaf spends the rest of the series either being a guide spirit or being alive in prequels from before she met Firepaw. Despite barely knowing each other for a few months, Firestar continues to be in love with Spottedleaf, even after becoming Sandstorm's mate, and it's implied he loves Spottedleaf the most.

Probably the most notable example of this trope is Rand's relationship with Elayne. The characters themselves feel pretty manipulated, but hey, prophecy can do that to you! Lan and Nynaeve are also pretty bad. The period during which they fall in love in book one is completely off-page, yet we're supposed to buy that it's strong enough that in the very next book, Nynaeve is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">shoving thorns through her palms at the thought of not being with him.</a> Other examples include Faile &amp; Perrin, who vaguely argue a few times while Perrin panics about a prophecy that says she's important to him, then suddenly they're in a committed relationship. See also: Gareth &amp; Siuan, who argue until she hears a prophecy that they should stick together, or Thom &amp; Moiraine, who only have one significant on-page conversation, involving one of them essentially extorting the other one to go away. Multiple books later, it turns out Moiraine is actually in love with him, mostly because she heard a prophecy that they'd get married.

They begin dating in the wake of Edmund and Brooke's breakup and her subsequent marriage to Tad. While not unhappy with Maria, he still spends the entirety of their relationship pining away for Brooke, proposing to Maria only after Brooke has rejected him once and for all, trying to reunite with Brooke twice during his engagement to Maria, even telling Brooke at one point, "What I feel for her doesn't come within a country mile of what I feel for you", and even ditching his rehearsal dinner to be at Brooke's side during an operation. Literally out of nowhere, Edmund one day declares <em>Maria</em> to be the love of his life. While it might actually be one of the better examples of this trope-they go on to have a genuinely blissful marriage until she's "killed" in a plane crashit's still a glaring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>.

Eventually, even the writers seemed to realize they weren't right for each other; after the Hawks departed in the Season One finale, having vowed to start their relationship over, the rest of the Legends commented that it probably wasn't going to last. What makes it most unsatisfying is that it was presented as purely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> at work; she was with Cisco in The Flash and Ray in Legends and struggling to resist these past life memories drawing her to a total stranger.

There were scenes in several previous episodes that showed them growing closer to each other, all of which ended up being cut. Eventually the writers just said "screw it" and threw them together without any buildup. It also didn't help that they hooked up in the very next episode after Dualla's boyfriend Billy was tragically killed, with the writing not being as clear as it could have been that at least a couple of months had passed, making it look like they practically started making out over Billy's corpse.

She got pregnant about two minutes after that and married him about two minutes after <em>that</em>. We're supposed to believe that they're madly in love and ready to spend the rest of their lives together when they've only been dating a few weeks—the very reason she was initially considering an abortion—and would have likely never discussed marriage had she not been pregnant.

Problem is, he made this declaration of love once, several years ago, but immediately took it back and apologized, given that he was married, and never brought it up again, indicating that he'd gotten over his feelings.
</li><li> Then in the final season, she meets an army major and within a few weeks is cheating on Dr. Marsham with him, engaging in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBangHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBangHer">Wall Bang Her</a> sex while at a party. She conceives from this, and the series concludes with them getting married. We're led to believe that this man is the love of Eleanor's life, despite the fact that she barely knows him and probably wouldn't have considered marriage if she weren't pregnant.

<ul><li> Rosa's relationship with Holt's nephew Marcus in the second season often comes off like this. The relationship is supposedly one of the most significant that Rosa's ever had and she is apparently deeply attached to him. However, the fact that Marcus was hardly ever around, when he was he didn't really seem that interesting or appear to have many distinguishing characteristics, and the fact that Rosa, by nature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, didn't really show a lot of emotion in general, made it easy for viewers to wonder exactly what the big deal was supposed to be.
</li><li> This gets even weirder in Season 3, when Rosa very suddenly falls in love with Adrian Pimento a mere few episodes after the character is introduced. He's a weird and creepy enough character to make it believable that Rosa would have a thing for him, but their sudden leap from "just met" to "we're getting married in a week" is jarring, to say the least. It's possibly lampshaded by the writers in the scene where they get engaged, right in the middle of making an arrest, with no buildup, fanfare, or anything the audience would consider even remotely romantic. Their whirlwind romance ends up being the catalyst for the season-ending cliffhanger, as the Nine-Nine ends up banding together to protect Adrian from a mob hit. One can easily get the impression that the relationship was introduced to keep the audience from wondering why the rest of the precinct would come together so easily in support of an officer they barely know, who is a bit of a loose cannon that most of the rest of them feel incredibly uncomfortable around.

<ul><li> Buffy and Riley had no hope right from the start. Granted, the writers <em>tried</em>, but they tried so badly to make Riley <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">"not Angel"</a> that they forgot to give him any interesting character traits of his own — or any that would make him even the slightest bit compatible with Buffy. Beyond that, there wasn't much build-up and the actors <em>really</em> lacked chemistry, leaving the impression that they liked each other because the script said so. The timing of this relationship didn't help much — shortly after Buffy's dramatic and defining relationship with Angel ends and Angel leaves Sunnydale, the writers tried introducing Buffy into a brand new romantic relationship with a brand new character (Riley) without giving much recovery time for the end of the Buffy/Angel relationship, which had been a primary storyline of Seasons 1-3.
</li><li> For Willow/Kennedy in season 7, the writers didn't even try at all. Literally the only reason they start a relationship was because Kennedy was also a lesbian, and Kennedy seemed determined to not have any likable traits whatsoever. It was a huge letdown after Willow and Tara's relationship, which out of the whole show had the most build-up and most development. It may have even been <em>worse</em> in the "too soon" department than Riley had been, as Willow had abruptly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> lost Tara to a freak accident</span> at the end of the previous season and was still mourning. Intentionally or not, the circumstances really made the relationship ring closer to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnTheRebound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnTheRebound">rebound</a> than anything else.

Bear in mind Kevin was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> with two kids and Molly was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, and a key part of her character was how much she valued trust in a relationship.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cursed">Cursed</a></em>: Arthur and Nimue's romance has been criticized for coming across as contrived and bland. Although they flirt a lot in the first episode, Nimue subsequently spends half the season distrusting Arthur for stealing (then losing) the Sword of Power entrusted to her by her dying mother - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst">which she seems to forget rather quickly</a> - and Arthur was willing to steal from Nimue when she was at her most vulnerable for selfish reasons (then victim-blamed her over it), despite supposedly having a crush on her.

On top of this, some viewers felt they lacked romantic chemistry and have little in common; the only reason they seem to get together is because 'the script says so'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> abuses this to an infuriating degree. Probably the worst example is in the movie <em>Degrassi Takes Manhattan</em>. Fan-favorite couple, Jane and Spinner, end up splitting up. And who does Spinner turn to? Not any of his many exes (all of whom he's turned to comfort before) or even some random one-shot hook up character.

Instead of getting the marriage annulled, they say 'what the hell?' and see if the romance roulette will actually work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fourth season's opening episode features a brand-new relationship between Lt. LaGuerta and Sgt. Batista, which apparently developed entirely in the gap between seasons, despite no previous chemistry other than a standard-for-the-precinct friendship. Batista was even involved in an entirely different (and more developed) relationship as of the last episode of the previous season which vanished without a trace sometime in the meanwhile. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Overstated drama</a> immediately ensues over everything from policies against office romances necessitating secrecy to overblown arguments over shared bank accounts and Batista fighting in bars to defend LaGuerta's honor. Meanwhile, neither the show's primary nor secondary storyline is even remotely affected by any of this, and the rest of the cast largely ignores it. It just takes a lot of screen time in Seasons 4 and 5. Then in Season 6 they are suddenly <em>divorced</em>.
</li><li> Season 7 had Dexter and Hannah McKay. They have little chemistry and hook up <em>very</em> suddenly, and pretty much the only thing they have in common is they're both serial killers. It's obviously meant to set up an emotional moment when Deb is forced to arrest Hannah; after all, she was "the only person who'd ever accepted Dexter"...except that the writers apparently forgot about Lila West and Lumen Pierce, both of whom had been perfectly willing to accept Dexter's killing, the latter even helping him out in the exact same way that Hannah did. The whole thing just felt rather forced. It happened again in Season 8, with Hannah showing up again out of nowhere, and she and Dexter bacl together within two episodes. Even Dr. Vogel, an expert on psychology and human behavior, couldn't stop gushing about how utterly perfect they were for each other.

While the actors tried to suggest some attraction within the story, the script didn't give them much to work with. It's basically, Doctor: "Come on, Leela, let's go." Leela: "No, I'm going to stay here and marry Andred." Doctor: "Okay, bye." This happened because the actress told the producer she was leaving at the end of the season, and he kept trying to change her mind. The Big Finish audio drama series <em>Gallifrey</em> ends up subverting this relationship in a fairly satisfying way.
</li><li> The posthumous pairing of Peri with King Yrcanos at the end of "The Trial of a Time Lord".

</li><li> Susan, Vicki, and Jo are three other female companions who were written out of the show by perfunctorily marrying them off, though while the relationships had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage">very rapid development</a> (one serial apiece) they weren't as completely out-of-nowhere as the two above. Still, with regards to Vicki in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E3TheMythMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E3TheMythMakers">The Myth Makers</a>", as soon as she's gratuitously renamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TroilusAndCressida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TroilusAndCressida">Cressida</a>" by Agamemnon simply because he doesn't like her real name, it should be quite clear to the viewers where this is going.

This is despite the fact that Martha had been shown to be engaged in a previous appearance (though her fiancé never showed up). It ends up looking like a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a>, and an even worse case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinorityCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinorityCouple">Token Minority Couple</a>-or, in the best case scenario, the writer just flat-out forgetting about things.
</li><li> Clara Oswald and Danny Pink's romance in Series 8 was criticized for being poorly written and too rapidly developed — in his second appearance, "Listen", they go on a disastrous first date, yet they're firmly a couple by the end anyway. <em>Then</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> situation with Twelve is brought into the picture two episodes after that, with only half a season to go! Then again, it all ends when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Danny is killed</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>, with a coda in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> afterward. A fan theory is that this storyline was written to maintain an overt romantic plot in the show out of fear that just carrying Clara's relationship with the Eleventh Doctor over to the Twelfth with little change would have alienated viewers due to Twelve being played by a much older actor. This backfired, partially because Clara and Twelve's initially rocky relationship smoothed out and became a much more convincing, if subtler, romance.
</li><li> In their early days, River and the Doctor fell into this trope for some fans due to the main gimmick of their relationship being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveWeMetYet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveWeMetYet">they meet in the wrong order and therefore one tends to gain affection as the other loses it</a>. Post-"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong">The Wedding of River Song</a>" they were on the same wavelength, alleviating this aspect of their relationship. However, in the 2015 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong">The Husbands of River Song</a>", it's revealed that River Song still had doubts that the Doctor truly loved her, not thinking it was in his nature; the story also did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> of the Eleven-era short "Last Night" (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eleven didn't take her to the Singing Towers after all</span>). Twelve doesn't hide his attraction to her, and the ending of this story reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twelve was with River at the Singing Towers, and the "night" they spent there lasted twenty-four years, effectively making him her "true" husband</span>.
</li><li> The problem with this is that "Husbands" aired just <em>three weeks</em> after the tragic three-part Series 9 finale that saw his long and well-established relationship with Clara Oswald come to a sad end, and many fans felt it was too soon for him to be so attracted to another even with his previous selves' established history with River. In Twelve's defense, however, 1) his relationship with Clara was codependently toxic by the end and they were forced to realize it was doing everyone more harm than good (after all, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> risked the space-time continuum to undo her death</span>), and 2) he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was effectively mind-wiped of his love for her</span>, so he wasn't brooding (much) over its dissolution by the time he met River again. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> went on to establish he traveled on his own or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> companions for quite a while between "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">Hell Bent</a>" and "Husbands", again giving him time to move beyond Clara.

At the start of the series, private detective Joe Miller is assigned a case to track down Julie Mao, a wealthy heiress and political activist whos gone missing. Since Miller is a cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop">Corrupt Cop</a> and resents privilege, he initially sees it as little more than a monetary gig and cares nothing for the subject.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> had Steve being in love with Laura from the beginning, despite how she had never given him any hopes that he would win her heart and was even mean to him during the first couple of seasons. And it was clear that she preferred the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> type, which was the polar opposite of Steve's nerdy personality. And for a couple of seasons, when Steve had a serious relationship with Myra and he had become friends with Laura, Steve's crush on Laura was almost forgotten about. But then came the 9th and last season, when it seems like the writers suddenly decided that Steve and Laura just <em>had to</em> end up together, despite how they both were in serious relationships with other people...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: Chandler and Monica are a perfect example of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>. In the first four seasons, there were no evident romantic feelings between the characters, they were close friends but just as close as <em>anyone else in the group.</em> They have a few sweet moments ("The One With The Birth", "The One With The Flashback", "The One With The Jellyfish") just like pretty much every girl/guy pairing on the show, but it was always platonic. Also, for most of season 4 they rarely have a one-to-one interaction... until the last episode when they spend a night together in London: this was the start of the Chandler/Monica era. Luckily, it was very well written and it becomes immediately popular with fans. Their relationship evolved from sexual to romantic and Chandler gradually overcoming his fear of commitment and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>.

<ul><li> Robb Stark and Talisa Maegyr in the second and third season. The show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">Four Lines, All Waiting</a> structure meant there wasn't nearly enough time to develop a proper romance between them, but after just a few conversations, Robb is so in love with Talisa that he's willing to risk his entire war campaign falling apart to marry her. It doesn't help that, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">the source material</a>, Robb marrying Jeyne Westerling (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">whom Talisa replaced in the show</a>) had less to do with love and more to do with preserving her honor after they slept together and she lost her virginity to him.
</li><li> Though their meeting was long-awaited, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow's romantic relationship ended up being rushed due to the compressed Season 7 episode count. The showrunners, writers, actors, and other characters state from the moment these two meet, Dany and Jon are attracted to one another. Their chemistry is a point of divide among the fandom — some feel Jon and Dany have chemistry, while others feel they lack it. Both have already been involved in serious relationships (Dany for love and politics more than once) and being royalty in a time of crisis, the two of them falling in love with one another can come across as immature to some viewers. Now that it's been confirmed that, as many book readers surmised, Daenerys, Jon, and their eventual relationship are one of the things that the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> title refers to, their coming together is a major point of the series and critical to the culminating points of the story. As a result, their relationship is one thing which absolutely should <em>not</em> have been rushed and should have been handled by the showrunners more carefully, a problem that continues into season 8 as most of the series' plotlines race toward the end.
<ul><li> In Season 8, some feel their relationship still lacks proper development and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fall-out after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of Jon's true parentage</span> wasn't sufficiently explored beyond it contributing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dany's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a></span>. Because of this, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tragic nature</span> when it comes to the culmination of their relationship in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jon must kill Dany to save everyone else after she torches a surrendered King's Landing</span> doesn't work for these viewers because it wasn't properly built up enough.

<ul><li> Tina and Mike Chang, who never interacted in S1 (Mike only spoke one line), and were basically put together for Asian jokes. Since then they have at least gotten some relationship development, although much of it was offscreen.
</li><li> Mercedes and Sam. Enforced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Sam's actor temporarily left the series due to contract disputes</a> right after Mercedes and Sam got together. When he returned, the writers treated their relationship like some tragic love story. Because it had next to no development, it was hard for most viewers to buy into that and get invested in the relationship.
</li><li> Brittany and Artie started off this way, and earned the show lots of backlash from angry Brittany/Santana fans. It became clearer over time that Artie was intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a>, and the whole relationship was designed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">force Santana to realize her feelings for Brittany</a>.
</li><li> One that carries some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>: Sam was originally created to be a love interest for Kurt, but was changed to be straight when Ryan Murphy apparently noticed chemistry between him and Quinn so strong that it just couldn't be denied (and which many fans have been quick to point out doesn't seem to come across onscreen). To his credit, he did also create another character as a love interest for Kurt afterwards.
</li><li> While the show had teased Kurt and Blaine for a while after Blaine's introduction "Never Been Kissed," after the mid-season break the show seemed to be heading in the exact opposite direction, trying to convince the viewers that the two were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a> by having Blaine fall for other people and turn down Kurt's advances while excelling in a mentor-like role. However, in "Original Song," Kurt's rendition of "Blackbird" causes Blaine to suddenly reverse his feelings and he and Kurt are sucking face just a few minutes later.
</li><li> More broadly, the show has been criticized for turning to these repeatedly to create tension between its primary couples of Finn/Rachel, Kurt/Blaine and, to a lesser extent, Brittany/Santana. They'd split up, often by cheating on or to hook up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> out of the blue, and spend half a season needing to re-realize their true feelings for each other.

Having never interacted prior to the 2008 season, they started working together and established a relationship based purely on insults, which half the audience interpreted as "secretly wanting to rip each other's clothes off" and the other half interpreted as "genuinely not liking each other" until one episode when she insults him, he looks like he's going to cry and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">best friend</a> declares that he likes her.

</li><li> Alfie and Willow fit this to a lesser extent. On one episode, out of nowhere, Alfie decided he had feelings for Willow. However, this does not make the pairing bad, as many fans have become attached to this pairing for their relatively drama-free attitude (which is rare for this show), their similarities, and their funny scenes together.
</li><li> Alfie has this with Piper, which makes sense because Piper was only on the show for three episodes. It's downplayed, in that he had originally believed she was Patricia, her twin, who he knew for years, and they had a few scenes together that showed them growing closer, which makes their short-lived relationship more believable.

Neither Arthur nor Guinevere interacted very much in season one, although the scenes that they <em>did</em> share had a strong emotional punch to them (Arthur comforts Gwen after her father's death, Gwen tends Arthur on his sick-bed, etc), but come the second episode of season two, Arthur stays at Gwen's house for a short period of time and impulsively kisses her when the time comes to leave.

Aside from the time frame making it unlikely that they could have been involved long enough to be considering marriage, their relationship is glaringly different from nearly all others the show has depicted, where considerable time was spent developing the character and the romance, and as such, his death fails to have any emotional impact.

</li><li> Some seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> have this in effect.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Zeo</a></em>, a future seen in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> had Tommy eventually married to Catherine, when they'd never really shown a romantic attraction before and Tommy's only love interest in the show up until that point had been Kimberly during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Might Morphin'</a></em>, who'd moved out of Angel Grove by the time that episode had come around.
</li><li> <em>Samurai</em>/<em>Super Samurai</em> had a forced last-minute hook-up with Mike and Emily in the last episode, despite the fact that they'd never shown a romantic interest in each other prior. The only hint at this eventual hook-up was Scott in <em>Clash of the Red Rangers</em> suggesting Emily looked at him like she had a crush on him, despite no direction, camera shots, or dialogue having suggested it not only the entire season prior, but even in that special itself.
<ul><li> There's also a secondary relationship that Daiyu and Decker had, since it was revealed that they'd loved each other hundreds of years prior to the series. The problem? Decker doesn't remember his life before becoming half Nighlok due to amnesia and Daiyu <em>doesn't even remotely try to remind him</em> about their past together. It's not helped that this development wasn't even remotely in <em>Shinkenger,</em> the series' source material, so it didn't have that kind of relationship between their counterparts. The seasons relied so heavily on retelling the <em>Shinkenger</em> storyline that even the changes they <em>did</em> make either didn't add up to much, or were to the series' detriment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Megaforce</em>/<em>Super Megaforce</em> has it arguably worse. Though it's shown Jake has a crush on Gia in the first season, it's an unrequited crush (also trying to be helped by the fact that their counterparts in <em>Goseiger</em> were <em>brother and sister</em> and, thus, they belonged to the same clan, which derived their ground motifs and had their mechs work in tandem a lot). After that, Gia apparently shows reciprocation of his feelings, but <em>doesn't even bother to tell him</em>. By the time <em>Super</em> comes around, the show was <em>way</em> too focused on cannibalizing the <em>Gokaiger</em> footage and plots it was adapting to try to make on seamless continuity between it and the previous season to focus on <em>anything</em> in that direction, not helped by the fact that none of <em>Gokaiger's</em> characters had romantic feelings for each other. By the time the finale came around, there was <em>nothing</em> suggesting that they were going to get together, so when Gia kisses Jake on the cheek, it comes right the hell out of nowhere, which is arguably worse than <em>Samurai's</em> situation, since it was given a bit of development, dropped, then picked back up at the ending of the season, whereas <em>Samurai</em> just had it barely established, then had it dropped into the last episode.
</li><li> Tellingly, when Judd Lynn took over as showrunner from Jonathan Tzachor for <em>Dino Charge</em>, he instilled a good amount of establishment of Tyler and Shelby's eventual hook-up, not only righting the wrongs of the previous four seasons before it, but also its <em>Sentai</em> source material, <em>Kyoryuger</em>, as described below in the <em>Super Sentai</em> section.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em>:

She treats him like crap, but he never stops mooning over her and eventually goes so far as to (temporarily) abandon the outlaws when he realizes that she has a crush on Robin.
</li><li> And what about Robin going from my-true-love-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">died-in-my-arms</a>-and-I-will-never-love-again to Wow, okay, Isabellas hot, Ill just goromp in the bushes with her thing in season 3? Maybe there was some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Evil Is Sexy</a> sexual tension, but romance? This makes Robin look like an unfaithful jerk after the huge balloon of suicidal angst that was the season opener. There was no explanation as to why Robin suddenly abandoned his angst over his true love for this woman who, incidentally, is the sister of his archnemesis and possibly trying to kill him.
</li></ul></li><li> A straight example in the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> that ultimately evolves into a Deconstruction. Sabrina falls for Aaron in his debut episode so much that she uses magic to find out what his flaws are. They hook up at the end of the episode and for the rest of the season simply act as a couple that's been together for years, rather than developing slowly. It's never explained why Sabrina literally makes room for him in her heart. However cracks start to appear as Sabrina initially thinks his proposal is a trick caused by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> and accepts reluctantly. The rest of her actions during their engagement come across as straight-up denial more than anything else. Finally when her wedding day comes, she gets cold feet and dithers between that and denial. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She and Aaron ultimately agree to call off the wedding.</span> It's worth noting that this plot wasn't supposed to be an example of this trope. The showrunners originally wanted Sabrina to develop a serious relationship with Josh, a character who'd been on the show since Season Four; the two really <em>had</em> known each other for years, and their back-and-forth feelings for each other were a recurring subplot. The problem—Josh's actor didn't want to come back for the last season, forcing the producers to come up with a last-minute replacement.

Amy wasn't upfront either, since she didn't tell him she was pregnant). For the most part, they were believable as two earnest, awkward teens in their first relationship. Then Ben proposed to Amy after they'd been dating a few weeks, upon discovering she was pregnant with Ricky's baby. Now the audience was supposed to accept that Amy and Ben had a deep and true love to last their whole lives and they and the other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">wouldn't shut up about how right they were for each other</a>.

While he had never considered this before, he decided to give it a try when he got back. This was the starting point of the writers developing a bizarre obsession with hooking them up despite the two never having any kind of romantic chemistry before, as well as Troi having a longstanding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> with Riker. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanFrakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanFrakes">Jonathan Frakes</a> (Riker) and Marina Sirtis (Troi) apparently disliked the idea as well, and were quite happy to have their characters get married in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">their last film</a>. Michael Dorn (Worf), on the other hand, refused to forget it, and, when given a line about how Riker and Troi's feelings for each other had never gone away, subtexted it like mad. Then Worf went aboard <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">DS9</a></em>, fell for Jadzia Dax, and acted as if he never even liked Deanna.

</li><li> Considering the above, it's funny how Worf and Jadzia have no romantic chemistry and no common interests besides the Dax symbiont's experiences with the Klingons.
</li><li> Jadzia and a one-off alien she meets in the season three episode, Meridian. The Defiant encounters a planet that shifts in and out of phase with this dimension, which has about 30 people living on it. Jadzia gets involved with the scientist living on the planet and ends up trying to take a leave of absence for 60 years to stay on the planet with him while it's shifted out of this dimension. Sisko looks like he's about to call her on this but then simply says he's happy for her instead. And then they find out that she can't actually survive the shift, she gets beamed back to the Defiant, and she never mentions or appears to think of him again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> has Seven of Nine/Chakotay. After three and a half seasons of them having only a professional relationship and almost no interaction outside of business, Seven suddenly develops an unrequited attraction to Chakotay in the second half of the final season. In the finale the two have become romantically involved, with Chakotay having fallen completely head over heels for her in the span of... well, the theme song. Particularly sloppy in that between the episode in which Seven explores romantic interactions with a holodeck-Chakotay and the finale was an episode in which the two of them were trapped together on an alien world. The actors specifically asked if there would be any follow-up to the holodeck romance that they should incorporate into their performances and were given a firm "No" in response.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep">Step by Step</a></em> had Dana Foster and Rich, who was her stepbrother's dimwitted friend. After spending two seasons barely able to stand being in the same room as each other, they suddenly started dating in season six... and still acted like they could barely stand to be in the same room as each other. In some episodes it really bordered on Informed Relationship.

This can be justified in Winn's case due to how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero">Socially Awkward Hero</a> he is, but Kara, despite being angry at Mon-El, suddenly decides to forgive him and fall in love, even though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> has been spotty at best. The writers even acknowledged that they put them together to give Kara someone to fix.

James himself goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for much of the rest of the season, making it even worse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger</a></em> after he returns from what was assumed by the rest of the cast to be a suicide mission, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daigo (Kyoryu Red) gets together with Amy (Kyoryu Pink)</span>. The problem with this is that both characters were depicted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Heroes</a> who had no real relationship chemistry and no romantic interactions prior to their pairing up. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">aftereffects</a> of this little twist was foreseeable, not only because it came out of left field, but also because there were two other characters who actually did have romantic character development with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daigo</span>. Of course, considering many fans' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">opinion on him</a>, this doesn't seem so surprising.
</li><li> In the same series, it's a running gag that Souji Rippukan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">never notices</a> that Rin, his kendo team manager, has a huge crush on him (despite his friends' efforts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">set him up with her.</a>) The sequel movie <em>100 Years After</em> retcons events so that Souji had begun dating Rin by the end of the TV series; but he still shows little interest in her and even completely forgets a date they had planned. However, it's revealed that they married shortly afterwards and were deeply in love until Rin died some time before Souji (who lives to be 116 years old.) There is no explanation for the sudden change in Souji's feelings.
</li><li> A third example from <em>Kyoryuger</em>: in episode 41, Nossan is thrown with Candelira during an arranged marriage interview (where she was posing as a human to harvest emotion from lovelorn men) and they almost instantly fall in love, which is used to spur her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and leaving Deboss. This is made out to be very important to the plot and their characters, yet the only foreshadowing was a single line of dialogue in an early episode when Candelira said that she could fall for him if they weren't enemies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger">Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger</a></em>, Emiri and Yukito are suddenly in a relationship at the end of the last episode, with no prior romantic interaction between them. When they return for a team-up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger">the following year's series</a> Emiri is completely devoted to Yukito and has begun to dress and talk differently to fit in with his upper-class background, becoming very unlike the carefree schoolgirl she was during the show. They reappear for a guest appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em> where they are now married and Emiri is working as Yukito's secretary, but still completely in love with him and with no explanation as to how they got together in the first place or the change in Emiri's character.
</li><li> A similar example to the above is Sen and Umeko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger">Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger</a></em>. They have a close friendship, but no romantic interaction until Episode 41 when Sen suddenly becomes jealous at Umeko getting engaged to another man. He proves that her boyfriend is an evil Alienizer, and Umeko suddenly realizes Sen has been the guy for her all along. Because it was close to the end of the show, there was no further time to focus on their relationship, so it doesn't really come up again until the crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger">Mahou Sentai Magiranger</a></em> where other characters can't stop gushing about how perfect Sen and Umeko are for each other and how they are obviously in love. However, almost none of their relationship is ever shown to the audience to make this believable.
<ul><li> Sort-of amended by <em>Dekaranger</em>'s "10 Years After" movie in which Sen and Umeko have been dating for a long time and have a few scenes together that make their relationship convincing.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">this for laughs</a> with Jackie and Hyde's hookup in Season 5. The two initially don't like each other at all, and it was only through their common friends that they're even in the same vicinity. They become better friends in Season 2 after he shows her how to deal with Laurie stealing Kelso from her. In Season 3, she becomes attracted to him and develops a clingy infatuation with him, which he's annoyed by, but he eventually caves and takes her out on a date. The two share a kiss, but Jackie says it didn't do anything for her and finally realizes Hyde isn't the guy for her. At this point they seem to have effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">been sunk</a>, and it's not brought up again until the Season 5 premier, when the others leave the room, and the two suddenly start making out and continue to do so. In the next episode, a flashback reveals they were watching TV and complaining about how bored they were, when they look at each other for a few seconds and spontaneously started making out. Yet, their relationship comes off as much more believable due because they give off a ton of chemistry together and by the fact that they initially spend a lot of time lampshading how strange it is.
</li><li> Sadly, the show also plays very straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostscriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostscriptSeason">Season 8</a>, with not one, not two, but <em>three</em> pairings.
<ul><li> The first is Hyde and Sam. In the last episodes of the previous season, Jackie and Hyde had encountered issues with their relationship resulting in Hyde taking a trip to Las Vegas to clear his head. In the first episode of Season 8, he returns, and his and Jackie's great relationship is completely tossed out the window when Sam shows up completely out of the blue and reveals that Hyde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight">got drunk</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">married her</a></em>. Jackie spends a total of one episode afterward angsting over this before moving on, and while Sam isn't a bad character, she and Hyde have absolutely no chemistry together.
</li><li> The second is caused by the first; Jackie and Fez. While Fez had a crush on Jackie since the start of the show, Jackie had never returned his feelings, not to mention Fez is a total horndog who was willing to nail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">Anything That Moves</a>. She had even continuously ruled him out. She did kiss him once and go out on a date with him, but after each of those events she had straight up said it was impossible for anything to happen between them. Then after losing Hyde and getting over him, she makes up a list of qualities she needs in a man, and Fez miraculously turns out to fit it perfectly, and they end up a couple.
</li><li> The third is Donna and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonSue">Randy</a>. Eric and Kelso are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for the final season, and both are given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Randy</a>. While Eric is in Africa for the final season, there's never any major indication that Eric and Donna's relationship is having issues. (The best the writers could come up with is Eric not talking to her on the phone.) Then, out of the blue again, Donna reveals that off-screen Eric broke up with her. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> tease, she ends up dating Randy. Making this worse is that Donna was clearly attracted to Randy <em>before</em> Eric's break-up. This one gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> twice over, however — most likely once it was known the show wouldn't be coming back for a ninth season. The two ultimately break-up rather quickly. Later, Eric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">returns in the finale</a>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">he admits he's not sure why they broke up in the first place</a>. It's left up to viewers to decide if Eric and Donna get back together officially, which unsurprisingly, many prefer.

</li><li> Sookie and Bill. The two of them never talk about anything except about how much they are in love with one another or what's currently going on in the plot. In the books Sookie flat-out ADMITS that their love is shallow and that she got into a relationship with him because A.) she couldn't read his thoughts and B.) she's never actually been in a relationship before. She even breaks up with him far earlier than TV Sookie and barely angsts about it at all; the love is SUPPOSED to be shallow but the people making the TV show didn't know that. Later episodes also point out that, for most, drinking a vampire's blood makes you addicted, and if drunk "from the tap" you're also addicted to the <em>vampire</em>. Given that Sookie only starts properly falling for Eric after drinking his blood (since vampire blood speeds human healing), it's speculated in-universe and out that that's the REAL reason he's on her mind.

The opening lines of the song sound like a textbook description of this trope: "He was a boy. She was a girl. Can I make it any more obvious?" However, the relationship actually didn't work out... because the girl in question couldn't see the "obvious" red string, and for that, she is treated like an idiot by the narrator.
</li><li> The American Celtic-Rock band Tempest has a number of songs that go this way, either because they're folk songs that have been set to a rock beat or because they're written in the style of such songs. For example, "The Journeyman" is about a journeyman tinker who stops in a town and within three days the mayor's daughter has declared her love for him. They promptly get married and set off for life together against the protestations of her parents.

Of course, she never explicitly says yes, so a director can play this any way he wants.

Lampshaded by Friar Lawrence when he says "Young men's love lies not in their hearts but in their eyes." A popular interpretation is that part of the tragedy is these two kids mistaking their shallow youthful lust for true love and that the adults who <em>should</em> be helping them realize that are too preoccupied with their own petty, immature squabbling, ultimately leading to the two's deaths. The poem on which <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is based, Arthur Brooke's "The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet," had its action occurring over the course of nine months—Shakespeare cut it down to five days. Brooke's poem isn't very good, but at least it has a believable timeline for falling in love.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em> might be even worse about this, with Ferdinand and Miranda. They declare their undying love for one another a full act before they even know each other's names, and never give any real justification besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a>. It's even more obvious when Prospero is suspicious of Ferdinand and tests his love, but a few more proclamations of love and devotion later (none of which go much deeper than "but I <em>really really</em> love her"), and he pronounces them a perfect couple.

They have basically no chemistry whatsoever and know each other for just a few days. Before long, though, it's kissing time.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuanticDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuanticDream">David Cage</a> has gained a fair amount of notoriety for this trope:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BeyondTwoSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BeyondTwoSouls">Beyond: Two Souls</a></em> generally tries to push Jodie with her CIA handler Ryan Clayton no matter the decisions you have her make. Most notable is how the game goes from the first time they meet, in which he's incredibly insensitive towards her and basically forces her into the CIA to a scene taking place roughly more than a year later, where Jodie states that she's in love with him. This becomes PARTICULARLY annoying if you've shut down Ryan at every opportunity and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chose to die</span>. Jodie will STILL act like she has feelings for him. Similarly, it's possible for Jodie to end up in a romance with Jay in the ending despite only knowing him for about two days.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a></em>, Carla is an NYPD police officer pursuing Lucas Kane, who she believes to be a psychotic murderer. Some developments in the case eventually lead her to doubt his guilt, but she remains suitably skeptical and logical. She finally meets Lucas at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the grave of his long-time girlfriend Tiffany, who had died <em>two days before</em></span>. Within about a month, Carla has risked her job and her life to help Lucas, begun to trust him implicitly without her previous intelligent questioning, declared her love for him, and gotten herself knocked up with his zombie child, <em>all entirely offscreen</em>. And this happens on all three endings, including the <em>good</em> one. Not to mention you can actually get back together with Tiffany without averting any of this.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em>, we have Ethan and Madison. This one has the benefit of being <em>sort of</em> optional in that you can turn her down, but Madison spends most of the game nursing Ethan back to health after the Trials and believing, for very good reasons, that he may be the Origami Killer with a very deep-seated mental illness. The clock is ticking on Shaun Mars's life, Ethan is emotionally and physically wounded, Madison hasn't slept in days due to insomnia caused by PTSD, but as part of Quantic Dream's celebrated history of completely inappropriate and nonsensical sex scenes, Madison decides this is the perfect time to get horizontal. With an injured man who openly admits he might be a serial killer who drowns little boys.
<ul><li> It's made even worse in the endings of the game where Ethan hooks up with Madison but Shaun dies. They go to the cemetery to visit Shaun's grave, where Madison tells him, <em>while they're still at the grave</em>, that she wants Ethan to bear her child and wants life to go back to the way it was before the game. This insensitivity ends up being extremely cathartic when Ethan takes this extremely badly and shoots himself, and many players who got this ending were flabbergasted with how insensitive Madison was in suggesting that after Shaun had died shortly before.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DetroitBecomeHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DetroitBecomeHuman">Detroit: Become Human</a></em>, while slightly less blatant than the other examples it is still shockingly easy for Markus to romance North (as in, have her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> jump from "Neutral" to "Lovers") even if he repeatedly goes against her tendencies towards violent revolution provided that you do not deliberately go out of your way to fail.

Throughout the game, your interactions with Catherine and Katherine will affect a meter—acting like you're in love with Katherine tips it to the Order end of the meter and the same goes for Catherine with Chaos. However, through a series of questions near the end of the game, it's possible for Vincent to choose either girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">(or even neither)</a> no matter what your position on the meter is. <em>But</em>, the game checks the results of your questions against the meter, and if it doesn't match up—for example your answers suggest that Vincent wants to stay with Katherine, even though the meter reflects that he's acted more in love with Catherine—you will get a bad ending. (On the opposite end of the scale, if your answers perfectly match up with Vincent's meter, you get a "true" or better-than-good ending.)
</li><li> Similar to the <em>Beyond: Two Souls</em> example, Kid and Serge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>. Kid is a unique example in that the player isn't initially forced to take her into the party. It's entirely possible to refuse her at several points and opt not to come to her rescue, <em>but she shows up at all the major plot points anyway</em>. The story justifies it by saying that she just follows you around because you're tough and can clear the way for her, but it mostly means she shows up at exactly the right time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">make a dramatic speech and run ahead of you</a>, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">end up imperiled</a> and need to be rescued— <em>at the player's discretion</em>.
</li><li> This is done on a meta-level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DokiDokiLiteratureClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DokiDokiLiteratureClub">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the first act, no matter who you spend time with, the game will always allow Sayori to have a love confession to you, even if you ignored her the entire time. Conversely, if you dedicated every scene to Sayori, you are forced to spend the weekend with either Yuri or Natsuki and share a very intimate scene with them in spite of barely sharing any emotional connection with them previously.
</li><li> In the second act, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuri forces her way to the center of the story (even if you select words that cater to Natsuki). Though at that point, the game is so glitched and Yuri's reaction is the same whether you select yes or no</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> will always have Cloud ending up very close to Tifa and having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">Did They or Didn't They?</a> scene with her under the Highwind. However, the game also has an affection system which allows the player to be kind to her or horrible — and while Cloud certainly gets a lot of scripted scenes with her in which he states his affection, he can end up bullying her much of the rest of the time. If the player chooses to do this, Cloud's dialogue in the eventual scene changes to come off as distant and bored, but he'll still wake up in her arms the next morning.
</li><li> Squall and Rinoa's romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> can come off this way, as Squall's extensive emotional issues keep him in heavy denial about his feelings for the first two discs of the game until Rinoa's coma forces him to start confronting them. Player choices may exacerbate this further: by not taking Rinoa along as a party member and/or missing certain plot events which provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for the pair, and by refusing the occasional dialogue options indicating that Rinoa's efforts to coax Squall out of his shell are making headway, the player can bypass much of the buildup of the relationship, causing Squall's sudden fixation on Rinoa in Disc 3 to seem as though it comes out of nowhere.
</li><li> A similar example can happen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, which clearly intends to ship Tidus/Yuna, but inexplicably includes a relationship system that includes Yuna, Lulu, and Rikku. Thus a number of scenes can take place implying Tidus' attraction with one of the other two girls before the game takes over and pushes him back to Yuna instead. While not nearly as extreme as the Rinoa example, as Yuna and Tidus have plenty of mandatory scenes throughout the story that build them as a couple and Yuna is always in the party when the game needs her to be, it can feel a bit ham-fisted if the player chased one of the other two women and yet Tidus always ends up with Yuna, Lulu always ends up with Wakka (which comes out of nowhere in its own right), and Rikku always ends up in the sequel single and refusing to talk about her relationship with Gippel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>: Noctis and Lunafreya have a relationship that is seen by fans as poorly drawn out and unfocused. This couple first met when they were kids after Noctis had a near death experience and they had not met again until the events of the actual game when they get betrothed as a result of a treaty between Lucis and Niflheim that turned out to be a sham. Even then, Noctis only interacted with Lunafreya before the eighth chapter through a notebook that they kept delivering notes to each other with Luna's dog, Umbra being the carrier. Noctis doesn't even meet up with Luna again until Ardyn murders her. The game's epilogue even shows them after they died, dressed in their wedding clothes and sharing a kiss. All of this is really not helped by the fact that Luna in general gets <em>very</em> little screentime, and Noctis spends almost the entire story hanging out with the actual main adventuring party, all of whom get their relationships with him fleshed out extremely well—meaning the love story that's meant to be seen as the core of the narrative to the point of being the game's logo is also the least interesting relationship in it.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em>, it's strongly implied that Finn and Lachesis were in love and that Finn continued to search for her. The only hitch is that during the time both characters are playable in <em>Genealogy of the Holy War</em>, they have no conversations together, not even if they're married in Chapter 5 (admittedly, Finn isn't there for plot reasons). It's like the devs somehow forgot to put it in there. Then again, it's also heavily implied in <em>Thracia</em> that Beowulf was Lachesis's "canon" lover, which makes things even more messy—given the timeframe, it's not <em>impossible</em> that Finn and Lachesis could have hooked up between the timeskip for a brief period, but it's not very likely, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> mostly averts it — you can only get your characters married after they spend a lot of time on the battlefield together (which can <strong>never</strong> be less than four battles, and will usually be more), watch multiple conversations that give reasons at least somewhat believable for the two falling in love (with more conversations implied), and even then you have to make the final push for the characters to get married yourself. Except Chrom. For storyline and mechanics reasons, he gets married to whichever one of his prospects he has the most support points with after Chapter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">11</span>. One of the characters Chrom can marry, Olivia, is made playable right at the beginning of that chapter. So if Chrom has no support points with any of his other prospects or they are unavailable due to permadeath or marrying someone else, he can marry Olivia very shortly after meeting her with all of <em>one</em> support point — not even enough for a C-Rank conversation! There's also a chance the player could get to the point of Chrom's marriage in the game and not have <em>any</em> of his potential brides still available, in which case he'll marry a random villager the player never hears from again. This even gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>:

Especially egregious are the Avatar's supports <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with his/her own <em>siblings</em>. Yes, granted, it turns out on both sides they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>, but still, given that half of them grew up with the Avatar as a sibling and the other half (aside from Ryoma, who knew the truth the whole time) thought the Avatar was their blood relative, it's a bit hard to believe that they've 'always been in love' with the Avatar</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> is a clear aversion.

If such a thing happens, you end up proposed to by whichever marriage candidate has the highest affection, regardless of how little it is. Celia is usually the character because she gains affection from just buying from Vesta's, with Rock being the default in <em>Another Wonderful Life</em>. However, this is averted if it's Nami, who agrees to marry you so she can stay in Forget-Me-Not Valley since she's otherwise forced to leave because of a lack of money.

It's given very little focus, and it seems to come rather from out of nowhere when the hero suddenly announces narratively that "I have to tell her how I feel." Prior to this, it's shown that he thinks she's beautiful, but she doesn't even seem to like him, yet he confesses feelings the player didn't know he had and she responds by kissing him.

A possible explanation for this is that the only people who comment on their "fated union" are Cia and Lana, both of whom have story reasons to invest in that idea; Cia uses it as an excuse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">lash out in jealousy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">seduce Link over to her side</a>, while Lana plays it up as a reason to cajole herself to stop pining for Link and start focusing on her duties again before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she too has her affections turn toxic and used against her</span>. However, that line of reasoning does bring up the question of why Lana would even need to maintain the mantra in the first place if she still had a chance with Link.

The problem is that whereas Sora and Kairi share a history and close friendship, Roxas and Naminé have only a few interactions that are largely based around plot exposition — Roxas himself shows much more closeness with Hayner, Pence, Olette, Axel and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">Xion</a> than he ever does with Naminé, so pairing them together comes out of left field and only seems to be on the basis that if Sora and Kairi are in love then their Nobodies have to be. Then the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> seems to be attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> Naminé with Riku, which makes even less sense.

Later games rectified this somewhat by making it clearer when that selecting a choice would start a romantic relationship.

Some fans found the jump from "comedic pilot/computer duo" to "soulmates" rather bizarre and quick.

Almost immediately after is the Psycho Mantis fight, at the end of which Mantis claims out of nowhere that Snake has a large place in Meryl's heart (ironically coming ten minutes after she herself claims to have had psychotherapy to destroy her interest in men while in training — so much for that). They have another conversation, then Meryl is shot and she's not seen again until the finale, where they're suddenly having a romantic moment and riding off into the sunset. However, Meryl is a complete no-show in the next game (the only hint of her even still existing is a purely optional Codec conversation between Otacon and Snake, where the latter comments that he has "had enough of tomboys" in regards to Olga Gurlukovich vaguely reminding Otacon of Meryl), and in <em>MGS4</em> it turns out the two broke up rather quickly afterwards.

Basically, he goes from being so disinterested in women that he was rumored to be gay to being so obsessed with the female player character that he's displaying <em>wedding rings</em> as his profile picture after less than two weeks of knowing her before they've even gone on a proper date! Not only that, but while Zen and Yoosung act flirty with you from Day 1, Jumin doesn't even begin to show clear romantic attraction to the player character until they meet in person on Day 5 which means that he's seriously contemplating marriage with her after only <em>six</em> days of actual romantic interaction with her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">To be fair</a>, in order to avoid getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> with Jumin, the player is required to call him out on how possessive he acts towards her and Jumin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> focuses on not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove">learning to love someone</a>, but also how to <em>manage</em> said feelings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">without going overboard</a> - in his route it's also called attention to how doting he is to his cat, Elizabeth the 3rd, but at one point Jumin mentions that he was using her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Living Emotional Crutch</a> and she can't reciprocate because she's a cat - he even tries to return her to V before V and MC convince him not to, but just to treat her as a pet from now on.

When you later find the Knower of Names, you can pay an extravagant sum to find out who his true love is — if you're female, there's a chance it's you. If you go along with it, the epilogue will talk a bit about your subsequent passionate romance, none of which will ever happen during play. Turns out quite silly if the Sleeping Man's true love is Evil!Aribeth.
</li><li> In the original campaign there's Aarin Gend, the spymaster. If you're female, you can talk to him on multiple occasions in act 2, and he'll talk about his troubled and criminal past, how Nasher took him in, and the woman he fell in love with but lost. You get a tacky heirloom amulet after one conversation and it gets upgraded a bit in a later one (nothing you'll have much use for, though). Then your journal outright states that you're Aarin's <em>lover</em>. Sorry, did I miss something?

However, looking through the unused files left in the game, as well as comparing what's in the game, it can be seen that there was a lot taken out of the Casavir romance as well.

As the story progresses, it's clear that Steve starts developing a crush on Claire and even makes a few passes towards her, but she brushes it off and, even as she warms up to him, seems to view him as nothing more than a new friend with no noticeable romantic intent. Near the end of the game, Steve gets captured, transforms into a monster, and nearly kills Claire until his humanity wins through, though Alexia fatally wounds him. Steve apologizes for the trouble he put Claire through and then dies, causing Claire to bawl her eyes out over a young man that she didn't seem to care too much about for most of the game.

If you pick up optional character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Marivel</a>, she suddenly effectively shacks up with Tony when everyone else is having romantic scenes that make sense. Tony is a minor NPC, and they didn't even share a single line of dialogue before suddenly being set up as a couple.
</li><li> It can be argued that the Matchmaking mechanic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em> is this trope in action, due to Yandere-chan manipulating events so the rival of the week falls in love with another character in <em>one week</em> so she would leave Senpai alone for Yandere-chan herself. The alpha builds have Kokona fall for her fellow drama club member Riku but there will likely be pairings where the rival barely knew her love interest until Yandere-chan started pushing them together (and indeed, in earlier builds with the matchmaking mechanic Kokona and Riku weren't in the same club and didn't interact with each other unless Yandere-chan manipulated them to).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yesterday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yesterday">Yesterday</a></em> has this with John and Pauline.

This may be mitigated a little bit with the fact that prior to John's amnesia, they were in love with each other.

</li><li> The first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoiHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoiHouse">Aoi House</a></em> seems to build up to a will-they-or-won't-they tension between Alex and Elle, only to throw it out in favor of pairing him with fan-favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Morgan</a> in the second half, despite Morgan's crush being infantile at best and Alex ignoring her for most of the series.

Quinn literally showed up for a single storyline, as a threat to Lindesfarne because she was in an arranged marriage with him that she couldn't get out of. So, even though a storyline had passed very recently that revealed that Rhonda and Edgar had completely patched up their relationship problems and Edgar was now a good, attentive boyfriend willing to humiliate himself for Rhonda, for the convenience of the Lindesfarne plot, he suddenly underwent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> and snapped back to nothing ever changing. This gave Rhonda an excuse to dump him and marry Quinn, as the story told us they'd been having an online relationship for years (this was the first time it ever came up). Also, the comic conveniently ignores that for all of Edgar's flaws, Rhonda was basically cheating on him the entire time they dated. The storyline was also used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put Rhonda on a bus</a> with a massive whimper. While Rhonda made a cameo or two at Lindesfarne's wedding, Quinn the plot device didn't show up until the next Rhonda-centric storyline about whether to take a job at Herd Thinners or Kell's startup company.

<ul><li> SoulKat apparently decided that Miles and Rachael needed to be shoved together as soon as possible, with little other than ID holding him back from doing it within a few pages. The part with Miles showing Rachael his junked plane, with Rachael reacting inexplicably well to Miles calling her pet-names and sharing his responsibility-dodging dreams with her, was the <em>toned down</em> version—the original, according to ID, was filled with juvenile flirting and completely unsubtle double-entendres from both characters. As Rachael has previously given every indication of absolutely <em>despising</em> guys like Miles, and as Miles has not shown a single sign of miraculously becoming the type of man she'd want to spend her life with, this trope is in full effect as she's steadily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> into a stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> to facilitate their pairing.

The entire thing makes it seem like it was done solely to get people to stop questioning Randal's sexuality ASAP, and it doesn't help that SoulKat has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">more than once expressed a desire for people to stop viewing Randal as so much as feminine and shown immense disgust and hatred for a number of fan-favourite same-gender pairings and those who like them.</a>

The only time we are given insight to this is that he fell in love with her photograph before ever meeting her and the rest of the comic is him basically refusing to leave her alone. Miharu basically falls for him because the story implies she's supposed to, then never really spends any time on developing them as a couple. It's just Makoto doing things like freaking out about losing her and making all her decisions for her and Miharu apologizing to him when he instigates conflicts. Yet even Miharu, after a whole four months of dating him, feels they're in a "serious" relationship in spite of them doing nothing more significant as a couple than sexting and feeling each other up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The comic ends literally with Makoto quitting his job to date Miharu full time and then after she declares she truly loves him the most, he <em>immediately</em> proposes marriage, which she accepts. The marriage proposal? Originally, it was just the words "Well?" The author got so much flack for how awful this dialog was that she stealth rewrote it, but it still doesn't consist of an actual proposal...and at no point in the entire comic, not even during his marriage proposal, does he ever tell Miharu "I love you."</span>

Ultimately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Usagi ascends to godhood as Sailor Cosmos</span>, Mamoru abdicates his claim to the throne to take Helios's place as priest of Elysian so Helios could go to Chibiusa's side, though Helios notes that he's not sure if that's what either of them wants. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's left open-ended whether they get together or not.</span>

This is perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Enforcedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Enforcedtrope">enforced</a> to ensure that none of them get into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> ship.

Before the comic even progressed past the <em>prologue</em> the two are all but professing their undying love for each other with Kyle insisting that he wants to have his first-ever sexual experience with the world's most notorious supervillain and has absolutely no doubts about it (in spite of being terrified for years of even having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">A Date with Rosie Palms</a> due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fire-based powers being fueled by emotion, which includes orgasm</span>), and said notorious supervillain declaring that he wants to reform himself for Kyle even though he's never had any second thoughts about his supervillain career before.

<ul><li> Though it was nowhere near as controversial as the later Makorra, some fans felt the romance between Aang and Katara to be underbaked (though it helped a little that the series wasn't nearly as focused on shipping in general). There are a lot of moments where Aang demonstrates romantic interest in Katara, but comparatively very few where Katara seems to reciprocate that interest—and in most of those moments, she seems mostly just confused and uncomfortable at the idea of being with Aang. Add in their great difference in maturity, and it came across for most of the series as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>. There were even some implications that Aang's interest in Katara wasn't entirely healthy; he acts possessive in a handful of episodes, and one involved the idea that he was so unable to let go of her that it locked him out of the Avatar State. They share a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowOrNeverKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowOrNeverKiss">Now or Never Kiss</a> about halfway through the third season, but even then, Katara was still pretty apprehensive about it, and there wasn't much further development (most of that part focused on Zuko) until they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedWithAKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedWithAKiss">Sealed with a Kiss</a> at the very end of the series.

Fans struggled to accept this relationship throughout the show's first season, but since then, plenty of episodes throughout the rest of the show, as well as further sequel series <em>Ultimate Alien</em> and <em>Omniverse</em>, managed to develop and add more depth to the relationship. <em>Omniverse</em> even went as far as to include some retcons on earlier periods in order to make that reunion on the first episode of <em>Alien Force</em> more acceptable.
<ul><li> Taken to even more extremes with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> for Ben and Kai. Much like the below example with <em>Danny Phantom</em>, they spent more time making the pairing inevitable than showing <em>why</em> they should be together, such as making one recurring character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their son from the future</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Danny and Sam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> were obviously planned to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> from the beginning, with almost <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">everyone</a></em> remarking on it, if not being an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>, and innumerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">S/he Is Not My Girlfriend/Boyfriend</a> moments. The problem is that the writers were so busy making the couple inevitable they never bothered to actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">show</a></em> why they should be together. There was nothing more romantic to their relationship other than them being friends of opposite gender, and the whole thing came off more a combination of awkward teenage hormones and defensiveness in the face of relentless teasing. Worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">Danny and Valerie</a> got real tension and some rather sweet development before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">that ship was sunk</a>, so it wasn't that the writers didn't know how to write a relationship, they apparently just didn't want to.

In the B-plot of one episode, they meet, argue, and make peace. The very next time they're seen together, they're engaged. Even in-universe, Hiccup and Astrid are stunned and confused by how... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">extremely close</a> the two got so quickly.

Suddenly, Crystal, whom he's known all of a few hours, was the love of his life, and he spends every episode after this — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">literally every episode</a></em> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">pining for her</a>.

Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedHeads">heroes really do just love redheads</a> that much. The writing team seemingly realized how bad the whole deal was and spoofed it <em>hilariously</em> in a later episode where Crystal sends out her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog">Big Friendly Dog</a> Lockjaw to try bringing Johnny to a place where they can be reunited. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">They spend the whole episode going through several dimensions... and never find that spot</a>.

Within the space of a few months, this relationship is apparently strong enough that Fry is conflicted about whether to move in with her and so devastated after walking away he feels the need to leave the universe entirely. As opposed to his long-standing attempts to romance Leela, something that gets pointed out at the very end of the film. Making this all the more egregious is that the previous film had the Fry-Leela romance as one of the main plot points, yet it doesn't even get a mention in the supposed follow-up until the last two minutes.

Vixen had previously only made a handful of silent cameo appearances, but without any buildup or reference to it, she and John are already in a serious relationship by her first speaking role. The writers initially paired them up post-time skip just to provide an obstacle for John and Shayera getting back together, but it got pretty difficult for them once Vixen developed as a character and they began to like her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says being voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GinaTorres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GinaTorres">Gina Torres</a> also helped).

<ul><li> Season 1 was only twelve episodes, with no others originally planned, and had to introduce and conclude a complicated plot about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and a war against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a>. A romance plot would inevitably have been bereft of necessary screentime to begin with, but then the writers decided to tack on a love <em>quadrangle</em> seemingly just for the hell of it. The end result is that <em>all</em> the attractions and romances were rushed, forced, glossed over, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">told instead of shown</a>, or quickly buried. The ambiguity of whether Mako and Asami broke up during the season or whether or not Bolin was over Korra didn't help matters. Subverted in Season 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Korra and Mako's personalities clash resulting in Mako breaking up with Korra. And by the end of the season, both accept that a romantic relationship between them won't work and end it for good</span>.

</li><li> Korra ending the series in a relationship with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asami</span> is this to some. They spent the first two seasons being mere acquaintances at best and romantic rivals at worst. The third season would have them develop an actual friendship with another, but come the last few minutes of the series finale, the two of them head off to the spirit realm while holding hands, their status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> sealed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> later on. However, a number of fans were caught off guard by this as there was a <em>three year</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between seasons three and four where the only contact they had was the occasional letter, only meeting again in the second half of the final season. The <em>Turf Wars</em> comics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">expand upon their relationship</a> however.

Twilight, who's had no romantic interest in anyone before, bumps into him several times and starts crushing on him, despite knowing nothing about him, having no meaningful interactions and him being of a completely different species.

This angered fans just as much as what happened with Flash, including all of Flash's supporters because they are ignoring Flash for a new guy instead of working with what they have already established.
</li><li> Invoked in the episode "Hearts and Hooves Day" where the Crusaders force a relationship between Big Macintosh and Cheerilee, which ends up going horribly wrong to the point the Crusaders fear the destruction of Ponyville. That said, many fans would come to feel Big Mac's eventual relationship with Sugar Belle several seasons later is this trope.

While the two had a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moments throughout the show, they were few and far between, and both showed far more interest in other characters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matilda and Pirate Maria</span> for the former, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blaze</span> for the latter) than each other. Given that the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, it's possible that there were plans to develop the pairing at a more natural pace that never came to fruition.

The relationship literally goes from "allies with a lot of respect and gratitude for each other" to "passionately in love" with the flip of a switch. It doesn't help that he's decades older than her (though unaging), which helped many fans to see them as more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">father/daughter</a> than anything.

Writers and cast were describing them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> right up until the final season was about to be released, but a couple of episodes made it seem like Glimmer had an unrequited crush. Then, when they actually did hook up in the series finale, so little had changed about their relationship from the times it was described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> over the course of the season that many people felt like it came out of nowhere with less than half an hour of show left, making it a fumble from the other end.

</li><li> In season two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked">Stōked</a></em>, the first episode involved Reef and Lo pretending to be in a relationship as a subplot in an episode, including pretending to make out. At the end of the episode, the two decided that they enjoyed making out and made out for real, leading to the two of them sucking face uncontrollably in every episode their romance is involved in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">derailing</a> the previously sweet Lo into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> and the previously chauvinistic Reef into someone who spends hours thinking up lyrics to love songs and poems. The vast majority of fans, unsurprisingly, hated the coupling, especially since the writers had spent most of season one teasing and building up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Reef/Fin</a>, only to strangle Reef and Lo with the red string in the very first episode of Season Two.

While Star and Marco start off with a good relationship that many people are fond of shipping, their dance under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate">soul-binding Blood Moon</a> is later revealed to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">forcing them to be together</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">whether they wanted to or not</a>. While the curse is lifted in the final season, the fact it existed for most of the show's run casts an awkward light over every romantic relationship both characters have had, as they were all doomed to failure because of the Blood Moon's influence and could have prospered without the curse. It also put into question how many moments of bonding were actual examples of such, or manufactured by Blood Moon. Because of this, the duo getting together so quickly in the final episodes feels rushed. On top of that, Marco's confession that he always had romantic feelings for Star feels confusing when none of his behavior even hinted that he viewed Star in such a manner before she revealed her crush on him at the end of the season two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs">Super Noobs</a></em>: The romance between Tyler Bowman and Amy Anderson is considered by fans to be underdeveloped and half baked. The aforementioned couple only got a couple of dates with one of them being forced and their relationship was only seldom mentioned in a few episodes. To make matters worse, Amy is regulated to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>, making her look like a cheap parody of superhero girlfriends like Lois Lane and Mary Jane Watson. Some fans thought that her relationship with Tyler would get more development if she became of the Noobs. What makes this even more baffling is that neither Amy nor her relationship with Tyler is seen or mentioned by the time the season finale episode comes.

Yes, this is half of the fanbase's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">OTP</a>, but let's face it—Duncan had <em>never</em> shown any romantic interest in Gwen before (though she obviously had a thing for him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">he didn't know about</a>), and while his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess">Courtney</a> was certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">rocky</a>, he was always depicted as head-over-heels for her, even taking her back after season two. In season three, he had <em>no</em> particular reason to want to break up with her, and when he came back to the show, hadn't seen her <em>or</em> Gwen in months. And <em>less than five minutes</em> after coming back, he's making out with Gwen behind Courtney's back, after literally the <em>first</em> conversation they've had in ten episodes.
</li><li> All three become contestants again in the fifth season <em>Total Drama All-Stars</em>. The problems between them resurface, with Gwen being defined solely as a boyfriend stealer, Gwen trying to make things right with Courtney only to accidentally hurt her numerous times, and Duncan still harboring feelings for Courtney. This all culminates in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gwen dumping Duncan because she feels he's still too interested in Courtney</span>.
</li><li> Subverted with Courtney and Scott. When Courtney is shuffled over to the Villains team, she starts impressing Scott by being her normal, bossy self, saying out of nowhere that, because his dad's in the army and his mom's a waitress, he's basically built to love taking orders and that he loves a bossy lady. This is completely different from his <em>Revenge</em> portrayal, in which he was a cheating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. Then in the episode "Zeke and Ye Shall Find" Scott and Courtney share an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss">Accidental Kiss</a>, to which they start acting as if they'll be together forever. They break up due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss">misunderstanding with Cameron</a> only <em>hours</em> into their relationship, then get back together the episode after, only for the relationship to be possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">sunk permanently</a> when Courtney's need to win once again proves to be more important to her than her relationships with others and their own feelings.

</li><li> Kid Flash and Artemis were <em>supposed</em> to be in a love-hate relationship. The show did establish the hate. The two of them were petty and mean-spirited with each other literally from the moment they met. It's on the "love" part of "love-hate" that the show dropped the ball. It appears that they were trying to portray both characters as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> for each other: Artemis was most prone to sniping at Wally when he flirted with other female characters, for example. They're never shown interacting with each other in a way that portrays romantic interest, and when the latter half of season one tries to convey some romantic interest between them it falls flat.
