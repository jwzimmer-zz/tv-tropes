</div></div><p>Because most authors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">write about what they know</a>, creators of fictional works tend to set stories in their home city/province/country, making for well developed, colorful settings. Even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCommunitiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCommunitiesWereHarmed">the actual place names are disguised</a>, they can still be identified as the author's home territory.

In this case, lack of imagination or assuming one's audience is unreceptive to anything remotely foreign may play a role. Of course, this is often a case of global realism being sacrificed for local realism. It might seem unlikely for one place to be the focus of so much activity, but setting it in a place the author is familiar with can help to make the setting appear more full-bodied and believable. It can mean the difference between a realistic environment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">The Theme Park Version</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, one country actually is more significant than most other countries in certain contexts, but highly provincial writers and viewers may simply <em>assume</em> their country has contributed more than any other in <em>every</em> way, for example, believing that the West-European front was more important than the East-European front in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> despite only involving 1025% of the latter's troops and 10% of its deaths, etc., etc. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayCountry">Throw-Away Country</a> trope is what happens when such writers absolutely <em>have</em> to mention another country.

<ul><li> In action series, it is seldom explained why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfAdventure">the heroes all live in such a small area that they will all encounter each other</a>, and why supernatural villains that attack civilians only do so in areas where the heroes will learn about it. In the most extreme examples, people from the Tokyo area proper are not treated as having a Regional Accent unless the story intentionally takes place elsewhere in the country.
<ul><li> Also, the Tokyo Dialect is used as a nation-wide standard for things like formal, "accentless" speaking, and teaching. You could view it as the accents of people in other regions are being illustrated as diverging from the Tokyo Standard norm.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> is about conflicts surrounding ancient Chinese martial arts in a wasteland caused by nuclear missiles launched from China. So naturally, everyone has Japanese names and makes mention of Japanese regions when real-world locations come up, even when the comic flashes far enough into the past that the Chinese origins of these styles are shown. Sequel comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky">Fist of the Blue Sky</a></em> is more explicitly set in China, but it also stars a more explicitly Japanese man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> is especially guilty of this, with the only time it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> being the second half of season 2, as the villains were from the future and were trying to alter Tokyo. It gets pretty ridiculous in later seasons when the villains are looking for a particular object inside of humans and somehow never decide to target people outside of Tokyo. Then again, it's kind of hard to think any other town could have so much supernatural shenanigans going on when the 30th century Moon Kingdom <em>is</em> Tokyo. The most ridiculous part is that whoever IS carrying what they're looking for will, without fail, <em>be in Tokyo.</em> (At least we can kinda fanwank that the villains had it on good authority somehow that Tokyo was <em>the</em> place to look for Whatever.) And 99.9% of the time, it's likely to be carried by one or more of the senshi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: The afterlife is Edo Japan with ghosts. Although there are indications that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">shinigami</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">quincies</a> cover the whole world in their fight against hollows, everything centers around Japan. Even characters that seem to be from other countries all behave like Japanese characters and are based in either Japan or the Japanese afterlife. In fact, despite the hints that Hollows affect the entire world, there are no hints at all that the afterlife is anything but Japanese.
<ul><li> That said, Quincies' equipment has a European style and the names of their powers are all German. Similarly, Hollows are Spanish flavored.
</li><li> In addition, the entirety of the human world, except for a few scenes in Mexico and a flashback somewhere vaguely in Europe, is Karakura Town. Not even Japan, just this one city. Hollows seem to only attack Karakura, and Soul Reapers only seem to visit Karakura.
</li><li> Surprisingly subverted when a Western branch of Soul Society was shown: since the action took place primarily in England, any and all things soul-related take on more of a sorcery motif rather than eastern tradition. This is part of the reason its reveal as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the setting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BurnTheWitch2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BurnTheWitch2018">Burn the Witch</a></em></span> was so effective.
</li></ul></li><li> Particularly ethnocentric publishers will publish foreign-made works for profit but attempt to erase most if not all of the obviously alien elements. This has happened quite a bit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">North American</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">adaptations</a> of anime, especially in the U.S. and Canada. In modern times, however, the only series that get truly affected are translations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kodomomuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kodomomuke">Kodomomuke</a> shows.
</li><li> Japanese manga or animated adaptations of many Western tales or novels normally avoid this for obvious reasons, but there are even some original Japanese stories when the whole plot take place in a foreign country, and sometimes, without Japanese characters that could help to empathize with the audience. This could be justified by the recent change in Japanese attitude towards foreign culture; rather than shunning it, many Japanese people openly embrace Western culture.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> (The characters are mostly Caucasian, with only Mikasa being of (half)-Asian descent, and she is implied to be the last of her ethnicity within the Walls. The most widely accepted interpretation of the published maps, interestingly, places the action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff">in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Madagascar</a></em>, assuming that it's actually on Earth at all.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg009</a></em> takes place at locations all over the world, and only one of the nine cyborgs is Japanese. The rest of the team is Russian, American (2), French, German, Chinese, British, and African.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerDolls">Power Dolls</a></em> (at least in the anime OVAs) has a sci-fi version of this trope: Despite the plot of the whole franchise taking place on a different planet from Earth, all the characters have a stated Earth ethnicity, as the characters are descendants from Earth colonists. Oddly enough, the main heroines, Fan and Yao, have <em>Chinese</em> ancestry and while there's a character with Japanese ancestry (Nami Takasu), she is basically a minor character.
</li><li> An aversion: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn">Yona of the Dawn</a></em> takes place in the fantasy version of Korea, which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreansInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreansInJapan">achievement by itself</a> taking into account the author is Japanese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia">Little Witch Academia</a></em> The main heroine Akko Kagari is the <em>only thing</em> linking this series with Japan, as the whole plot takes place in England. Curiously though, the titular academy seems to follow the Japanese School Year, with first-term picking up in April. Another example: episode 16 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017">the TV series</a> is set in Finland, Lotte's home country, however, her parents say <em>itadakimasu</em> before a meal, which is customary in Japan but unheard of in Finland.

Both the light novels and the anime describe the town in sufficient detail to make it obvious where it's set, but the animators turn this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground">modeling every location in the anime after a real-life location in the town</a>.
</li><li> A particularly bizarre one in the <em>Free Fight</em> manga: at one point the fight commentator goes off on a tangent about morality, mentioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating">businessmen paying high school girls for sex</a>. Except that the fight is taking place in the US, where the practice of paid dating doesn't exist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> is set for the most part in Japan, and when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s global plan is finally enacted, other world countries only get a passing mention at best. The final battle is set in low Earth orbit, but even then, Japan is the only country that can be seen, with the rest of the planet being covered by Life Fibers.
</li><li> Zig-zagged by the old anime <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muteking,_The_Dashing_Warrior">Tondemo Senshi Muteking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which is set in the US, more specifically in San Francisco, and takes a good deal of inspiration from the American culture of the time (roller skating, cop shows, and so on). However, halfway through the series the main characters move to Japan and stay there for the remainder of the episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>: The manga is set in a fictional Thai city, with an extremely multicultural cast (one Japanese guy, one Chinese-American girl, two American guys, Russian, Chinese, Italian and South American mobsters...). The trope still shines through in an early arc where the heroes face a band of white neo-Nazis who display the kind of comedy behavior associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">Japanese Delinquents</a> (exaggerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a>, etc.), and later, when the cast has to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> in the "Fujiyama Gangsta's Paradise" arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>'s animated adaptations have the characters go to Kyoto for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassTrip">Class Trip</a>, with nice Kyoto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground">Real Place Backgrounds</a> to give it that extra sense of flair, thanks to the locale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a>, the studio who did the adaptations. Gets particularly weird with <em>K-On!</em> specifically because some of the settings in the girls' hometown are also taken from Kyoto, despite the fact they have to travel to visit Kyoto, implying they <em>don't</em> live there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PAWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PAWorks">P. A. Works</a> are <em>very</em> fond of setting their works in their native <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFortySevenPrefectures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFortySevenPrefectures">Toyama prefecture</a>, even those with aliens and fantasy monsters. Some of them get bonus points for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground">being set in their</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground">hometown</a></em>, Johana/Nanto.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TrueTears">True Tears</a></em> is set in the town of Johana, where the studio was based until it was amalgamated with other nearby places into Nanto in 2004.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kuromukuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kuromukuro">Kuromukuro</a></em> is mainly set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff">Kurobe and Takayama</a>, but the prefecture seat and Nanto also get a chance to shine, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">aliens even destroy the newly-built studio building</a> in Nanto.
</li><li> Manoyama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SakuraQuest">Sakura Quest</a></em> is quite openly based on Nanto, with its station being Johana station, and the woodcarving district is based on the same in Inami, another of Nanto constituents.
</li></ul></li><li> Both invoked and played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators">Re:CREATORS</a></em>. The fictional characters (or "Creations") that came to life in the real world are all based on in-universe Japanese properties, because the one who brought them was herself a Creation drawn by a young Japanese doujin artist, so she brought the ones her author was most familiar with. Played straight because, when in the end the entire world is in danger, nobody outside our heroes and the Japanese government is ever shown to care (or know) about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em>, the known crew of the Yamato is entirely Japanese, even though the Yamato belongs to the United Nations Cosmo Navy (and thus make one think that there would be at least one nonJapanese crew member)
</li><li> Exaggerated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco">Space Patrol Luluco</a></em>, where Ogikubo (where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioTrigger">Studio Trigger</a> makes base) becomes an interstellar immigration hub. Then taken further when Ogikubo and <em>only</em> Ogikubo gets packaged up for sale, and even further when it's revealed every planet in the show's star system has one of their own. The clincher has to be when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luluco goes to Hell, and the background is just a color-filtered version of outside the Studio Trigger office</span>.
</li><li> A really bizarre version of this happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheRisingOfTheShieldHero">The Rising of the Shield Hero</a></em>, despite taking place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">another world</a>: One of the main characters, Raphtalia, is a half-human, half-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki">Tanuki</a></em> girl, which wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for the genre if wasn't for the small detail those animals are native from East Asia<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0emxl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0emxl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0emxl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Through tanukis were introduced in Europe via Russia, but traditionally those animals are considered as a part of the Japanese folklore, In some countries like Sweden, they are even considered an invasive species.</span> and the setting of the light novel and the animated adaptation is heavily based in a fantasy Medieval European one. The only reason this trope applies is that both the story and Raphtalia's master, Naofumi Iwatani, are from Japan.
<ul><li> The three other heroes that came with Naofumi were called from alternate Earths... and just so happened to be from their equivalent of Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> is set in a Western-style medieval fantasy world, and as such most characters are Caucasian, with a few having dark skin. However, Captain Yami is stated to come "from the East", has a distinctly Japanese name, grew up as a fisherman, goes to festivals in a happi and sells fried squid at them, wields a katana, and teaches Asta about the concept of Ki.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba">KonoSuba</a></em> has a spinoff chapter where Kazuma chews Aqua out on the importance of saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseStockPhrases" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseStockPhrases">"itadakimasu"</a> before meals. This phrase is a distinctly Japanese/Shinto-only ritual in real life, and the world of the light novel is a standard Medieval European fantasy world. As such, it has several fantasy religions with gods you'd expect Aqua to explicitly pray to before meals if she was going to pray to anyone at all (the perplexingness of lecturing an actual goddess on the importance of prayer notwithstanding).
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RobiHachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RobiHachi">Robi Hachi</a></em> takes this and runs with it. Despite the galaxy being made up of many races besides humans, Japanese appears to be the only human language that has official status across it. Hostess bars, an exclusively East Asian phenomenon in real life, are widespread. An entire planet of aliens are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">obsessed with anime</a>, and the resort planet of Isekandar resembles a Japanese tourist town, with shops selling exclusively Japanese foods and souvenirs and its chief attraction, a giant glowing alien crystal, being housed in a building with all the trappings of a Shinto shrine. In fact, most of the planets the main trio visit along the way are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a> of various Japanese towns and cities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet">Boarding School Juliet</a></em> has a rather odd case. The nations of Touwa and Westia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a> of Japan and Italy, respectively, hate each other, and the inhabitants of each country are stated to be equally as racist toward the other. However, while most of the Westians, barring some of the main characters, are shown in practice to be racist assholes, the Touwans are only shown to be delinquents or stern traditionalists whose prejudice hardly comes close to the Westians. This is best exemplified in a scene where a diplomat from each country visits Dahlia Academy—the Westian is openly rude and nasty toward the Touwan students while the Touwan diplomat is portrayed as contemplative and wise.
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Promare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Promare">Promare</a></em> takes place in a metropolitan American city implied to be a stand-in for Los Angeles, and is localized entirely in America and stars American characters. However, Galo's fire fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> is based on ancient Japanese fire fighting gear and he even spends some time gushing about how those ancient fire fighters are so cool and how they exhibit the ideal fire fighting spirit.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> is particularly guilty of this:
<ul><li> Earth has, to date, had <em>six</em> well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lanterns</a> — which is remarkable in itself, since Green Lanterns represent huge sectors of space, not individual planets — and <em>all</em> of them are from North America (five being males from the United States). Although this is justified at least initially with Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner — Abin Sur had crashed in the US and told the ring to find the <em>closest</em> worthy person. He was in the US, so Hal and Guy were the two closest. Dennis O'Neil argued that the third Green Lantern, John Stewart, should be African-American on the grounds that it was <em>extremely</em> unlikely that out of the entire human race, the Green Lantern rings would choose two white American males in a row to represent Earth. Kilowog was an exception during his brief stay on Earth: he elected to move to the Soviet Union because his own civilization was closer to the communist way of thinking.
</li><li> Every superpowered alien in the DC Universe - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire">Starfire</a>, etc. - either chooses to live in the United States or ends up there by chance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRedSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRedSon">Superman: Red Son</a></em> averts this: through a mere chance of fate, Kal-El lands not in rural Kansas but on a kolkhoz in Ukraine, and grows up to fight not for "truth, justice and the American Way", but "Stalin, socialism and the international expansion of the Warsaw Pact". While an interesting idea and attempt to explore and avert this trope, it also seems like it was simply an elaborate excuse to make a Stalin/"Man of Steel" pun.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> has lately been written as a world traveler with multiple superhero identities in several countries, probably in recognition of this very problem. Almost all of this, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">takes place off-camera</a>, but that's probably an artifact of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">America</a></em>.
</li><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a>, though it's still headquartered in New York City. The JLI explicitly invokes this trope. Doctor Light (a heroine from Japan) actually states at one point that it's a political necessity that the Justice League have a more diverse, multicultural membership, as the global community is more likely to be accommodating toward a team of superheroes that does not solely consist of white Americans.
</li><li> There are also superhero teams outside the U.S., but they don't normally get their own series. For instance, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatTen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreatTen">Great Ten</a> in China. Or Japan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperYoungTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperYoungTeam">Super Young Team</a> and Big Science Action.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">The Silver Age</a> had "Batmen of many nations", but all of them were <em>inspired</em> by the American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>. This was reformed as Batman Inc in the 2000s, and actively did have numerous international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> heroes, many of which were bat-themed and often actively inspired by Batman, but most existing before coming into Bruce's fold.
</li><li> And, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> is Batman with a bow there were also Green Arrows of many nations.
</li><li> The 2007 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainCarrotAndHisAmazingZooCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainCarrotAndHisAmazingZooCrew">Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!</a></em> miniseries seems to assume that all of Earth-C's superheroes were in the United Species of America (Earth-C's United States of America), and thus subject to the American government's anti-superhero initiative (which included removing the non-Zoo Crew heroes' powers), with the President noting at one point that thanks to the law, there are "no other superheroes on Earth!" Apparently Cornada, Verminy, and Loondon (Earth-C's Canada, Germany, and London respectively, all places mentioned or shown in the original Zoo Crew series) were superhero-less... or that the other heroes simply moving to any of those places (and thus avoiding the law) wasn't an option...
</li><li> Much worse in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrightestDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrightestDay">Brightest Day</a> event. Atrocitus uses his magic to divine the locations of the seven emotional entities. Two are captured by someone in Ysmault. The other five are in U.S. territory.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Comics</a> is also guilty, as most of its heroes reside in New York, the city where the company's headquartered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>, etc. all hail in/from the Big Apple, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> live in nearby Westchester County. This is occasionally lampshaded by civilians, villains, and heroes in the universe. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, who is from Canada and will kill you if you insult it, spends most of his time in the US. When the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">started to get popular</a>, several attempts were made to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomegrownHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomegrownHero">actually being American</a>. Fortunately, none of these stuck.
<ul><li> One of their (once) most popular titles, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em>, followed the national super-team of the UK. The X-Men lived in Australia for several years, too, but <em>Excalibur</em> was created by writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>, who was born in Britain, and British artist Alan Davis. And the team in its original form consisted of two Britons, two Americans and a German.
</li><li> This was lampshaded during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM">Decimation</a></em> event when Henry Peter Gyrich remarked how, now that there are no mutants around any more, the US wins the superpower race by default since statistically, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">happy accidents</a>" (like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>) and scientific advancements (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>) that lead to meta-humans being created occur more frequently in the US than anywhere else in the world.
</li><li> Another exception: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight">Alpha Flight</a>, but that was created by Canadian artist and writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>.
</li><li> Yet another: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a>' bases are in Southern California. In fact, besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CloakAndDagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CloakAndDagger">Cloak &amp; Dagger</a>, none of the other heroes show up in the comic unless they're in New York themselves or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're being apprehended by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></span>.
</li><li> Both Marvel and DC actually do assume that there are superhumans living all over the globe - in fact, both have had crossovers or miniseries that existed simply to introduce a lot of global heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">who were treated as characters that had always been there</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">you just never saw them before</a> - it's just brought up infrequently, so every now and then a completely unnecessary lampshade gets hung on it by a writer who doesn't realize that there are lots of characters they've never heard of and lots of writers before them who had the same idea.
</li><li> Wolverine and the rest of the characters introduced in Giant Size X-Men #1 were intentionally designed to be a new group of mutants from around the world... they all just got recruited to go live in Westchester.
</li><li> This was lampshaded during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> arc: at the height of the conflict, the Canadian characters in Alpha Flight were mocking all the angst going on among the American superheroes concerning the Registration Act by pointing out that other nations (including Canada) had something equivalent in place for years without having had either opponents, supporters, or the governments in question go as insane over the issue as the Americans currently were.
</li><li> Banshee was even a member of "Mutants Without Borders", a charity organization that helps mutants in the third world. Of course, it was owned and run by the American X-Man Archangel.
</li><li> This whole situation was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MightyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MightyAvengers">Mighty Avengers</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueMarvel">Blue Marvel</a> is a black superhero from America who divides his time between the Avengers and helping out various other superheroes across the globe, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> being that whenever he mentions any of his non-American hero comrades, none of the Avengers have even the slightest idea of who the hell he is talking about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision2015">The Vision</a></em> takes place almost entirely in a suburb of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a>, despite Vision working for the New York-based Avengers, because writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKing">Tom King</a> lives and works in Washington.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme">Squadron Supreme</a></em> limited series takes place on an Earth suffering from near-total collapse, yet the entire story takes place in the United States. This is especially jarring given that much of the story focuses on how the Squadron's efforts are impacting the rights of individuals, yet the laws and traditions of different countries are never addressed.

Most of his illustrated novels were set in an ersatz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra">Edwardian England</a> or an ersatz Europe of that era. Gorey himself never visited England, and rarely traveled outside his home state of Massachusetts. Though Gorey's books (which are books, not comics) do sometimes play this straight, as stories like "The Willowdale Handcar" and "The Iron Tonic" are in an ersatz Edwardian version of the US (the former featuring town names that are amusing parodies to New Englanders like those from Gorey's home state) and he devoted an entire book, "The Lavender Leotard", to very obscure in-jokes about his obsession, the New York City Ballet and George Balanchine. (Gorey saw literally every <em>performance</em> for several seasons, and the book is basically observations that would only make sense to another NYCB balletomane.)
</li><li> Averted in the Argentinian comic strip (and animated movie) <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BoogieElAceitoso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BoogieElAceitoso">Boogie El Aceitoso</a></em>: Despite the author being Argentinian, the titular character, Boogie, is a <em>racist, white American hitman</em> who hate (and kills) black people and Hispanics for fun, and most of his stories take place in the United States, or in few cases, in Central America during the many wars that happened there in the 80s, but <em>never</em> in Argentina. Even the author himself lampshaded the fact many times in many interviews about the topic.
</li><li> Played straight and averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MortadeloYFilemon">Mortadelo y Filemón</a></em>: There are plenty of stories set in other countries or as world trips (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodGeography">not that they're accurate or anything</a>), but quite a few have evil criminals, aliens or whatever that just happen to hide/go to Spain for no real reason. Best example? <em>Expediente J</em>. The evil aliens send a few havoc-causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">phlebotinum</a> rocks to Spain (and accurately, around the area the main characters live at that) and when their leader appears at the end, he assumes that has caused ALL of humanity to be a mess. What?
</li><li> Although Italian Disney artists occasionally point out that Duckburg is supposed to in North America, they tend to make the Disney characters take a particular interest in Italian history, Italian culture and Italian geography. Sometimes it's justified—you don't have to know much about tourism to realize that a restaurant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EiffelTowerEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EiffelTowerEffect">a view of the Leaning Tower of Pisa</a> is a good investment (although you have to wonder how a busy financial tycoon like Scrooge McDuck can find the time to run the place himself). But it seems weird that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderHeroVsYoungerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderHeroVsYoungerVillain">Scrooge and Rockerduck</a> would drop everything to see who can be the first to build a bridge over the strait of Messina, Sicily. Or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>'s nephews argue obsessively over who was Italy's best player in the soccer world championship 18 years ago. Of course one of the major antagonists, Magica De Spell <em>is</em> an Italian (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">her creator</a> is American). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> was guilty of this at several points throughout his works. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLifeAndTimesOfScroogeMcDuck">The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck</a></em>, Scrooge arrives in Louisville, Kentucky, Rosa's home town.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em> is created by DC Thomson who are based in Dundee, Scotland, and their Scottish origins are often clear most notably in strips based around Scotland such as the McTickles, Wee Ben Nevis and Red Rory of the Eagles.
</li><li> Mexican comics tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">play with this trope</a> <em>a lot of times,</em> since we see some stories that take place in Mexico and other titles in other countries or outside Earth. Some notable examples:
<ul><li> Most of the stories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fantomas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fantomas">Fantômas</a></em> (the Mexican version, not the French one) take place overseas and a few times in Mexico too. The fact that the title character's nationality is unknown does help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Kaliman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Kaliman">Kalimán</a></em>, another Mexican comic, also takes place worldwide along with Mexico sometimes. And the title character, Kalimán, hails from India and his young sidekick, Solin, is from Egypt.
</li><li> The black-and-white comic, <em>Samurai: John Barry</em> averts this trope, since the whole series takes place in the Sengoku-era Japan (and sometimes in Europe) and all the characters are Japanese and Europeans, but we don't see a <em>single Mexican character</em> here.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u1bx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u1bx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u1bx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Justified, due to the time period, since Mexico didn't exist as a country, but as an Spanish colony in that era.</span>
</li><li> The highly-controversial comic, (in the U.S., at least) <em>Memin Pinguin</em> takes place most of the time in Mexico, but some of the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">story arcs</a> took place abroad, like in the United States and Africa.
</li><li> <em>Soul Keepers</em>, another Mexican comic, also avoids this trope: While some stories of the comic take place in Mexico, the titular characters, the Soul Keepers, are not Mexicans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>7 Prisoners</em> is a French comic that takes place in a prison on the moon, housing hundreds of thousands of prisoners from all over the world. Naturally, three of the eponymous prisoners are French (four if you count the artificial lifeform created by two of the Frenchmen). And of the three Frenchmen, two committed crimes so they could go to the prison and find something, meaning they're just about the only inmates who aren't career criminals. Just saying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13">Gen¹³</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm">WildStorm</a>'s flagship title for pretty much all of its 18 years, so it should come as no surprise that the team was primarily based in La Jolla, California, where Wildstorm's offices were located. This changed a handful of times as the book went on (for instance, one arc had the group living in Tokyo, and on various occasions they've gone on the run with no set base of operations), but everything goes back to La Jolla sooner or later.
</li><li> The infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NovasAventurasDeMegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NovasAventurasDeMegaMan">Novas Aventuras de Mega Man</a></em>, amongst its many changes, abruptly uproots the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> franchise and claims that it takes place in Brazil (and always has). It got even more blatant when one writer introduced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> character with strong nationalistic beliefs who ranted about how there need to be more comics about Brazilian characters; then it came to light that said writer planned for his character to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">kill off the Mega Man characters and take over the comic</a>, which got him fired.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelgianComics">Belgian Comics</a>: Many Belgian comics take place in Brussels or a typical Flemish/Walloon village.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em>: The main characters have time travelled a lot to periods in Flemish/Belgian history and have met many Flemish folklore characters. When the series caught on in the Netherlands the characters suddenly started using KLM airlines and travelling more to hot spots in the Netherlands. It got to the point that they even referred to themselves as Dutch in some stories. In "De Goalgetter" Suske become a soccer champion and joins the Dutch national team rather than the Belgian one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HaagseHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HaagseHarry">Haagse Harry</a></em>: All action takes place in The Hague, The Netherlands, where all the characters also speak with the local accent of that city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlbedoErmaFelnaEDF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlbedoErmaFelnaEDF">Albedo: Erma Felna EDF</a></em>, just like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerDolls">Power Dolls</a></em> above, is an sci-fi, alien version of this trope, albeit a somewhat contrived version of it: The titular heroine hails from a planet who is basically, taking into account the way how it is described in-universe, an alien, furry version of <em>Japan</em>, since it shares similar customs and traditions. Her best friend Toki, on the other hand, is depicted as came out from the alien version of the Netherlands, or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreestateAmsterdam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreestateAmsterdam">the stereotypical version of it</a>. While there's an alien version of the U.S. (the Independent Lepine Republic), they are depicted as the <em>bad guys</em>, mixed with tropes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Nazi Germany</a>. Even more egregious the author is a former member of the USAF.
<ul><li> In a more meta-example of this trope, most of the animal species who appears in the story are descendant from American, European and Oceanian species and breeds, albeit some stock animals from African countries (hippos, lions, cheetahs, etc) also appears as well. There's almost <em>no</em> animals from Asian countries (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki">Tanukis</a>), albeit in some fanart the author has included some Asian breeds like the Japanese Shiba Inu breed. As a rule of thumb, Western species and breeds tends to appear more frequently in the story than non-Western ones.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover">Massive Multiplayer Crossover</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em> are based off English works, just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">the writer</a> and the artist are English. That's fine and dandy for the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">Victorian</a> setting, but it's quite jarring to see how few, say, American and Japanese references appear when the plot travels to 2009. The fact that famous English post-Victorian era characters like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></span> receive no small amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> hasn't helped either.
<ul><li> This is averted however in the supplementary material, especially <em>The New Traveller's Almanac</em> which has references to Colombian, French, Russian literature and other obscurities. Later volumes also make heavy references to German playwright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a> (whose creations include Captain Nemo) is a French author. Likewise, <em>The Nemo Trilogy</em> makes references to Godzilla and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanExpressionism">German Expressionism</a>.
</li><li> One reason why Moore plays this trope straight is that his books are about the darker aspects of culture and the way literary imaginations of certain places and events (such as how English people imagine African, Chinese and Indian writers) coloured real-life visions of these cultures. The motif of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructedWorld">Constructed World</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> based entirely on fictional depictions of the past is partially a commentary on the limits and virtues of the fictions various cultures dream up.
</li></ul></li><li> Most stories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WilqSuperbohater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WilqSuperbohater">WILQ  Superbohater</a></em> take place in Opole, which the authors' home town, and much effort was given to faithful depiction of locations and names around the town. On few occasions, Wilq visits Cracow, where the Minkiewicz brothers have been living since their study at the Academy of Fine Arts in the 1990s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> takes place in Bretagne, France. The protagonists are Gauls (Frenchmen) who frequently visit other countries, where Obelix always dismisses the odd habits of local people as "crazy". Many jokes reference francophone culture and aren't always that easily translatable to other countries.
</li><li> The original authors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> set the series in a fictional American city but ended up making it look more like an European one, resulting in non-European fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">being unable to understand where Heatherfield is supposed to be</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> with the animated adaptation, where Heatherfield is clearly shown as an American city.
</li><li> Various comic books from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChileanMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChileanMedia">Chilean Media</a> are based on real Chilean cities where their characters come from. Two notable examples are the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DiabloChile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DiabloChile">Diablo</a></em> and <em>Captain Chile</em>, in which adventures happen in Santiago and Valparaiso respectively (where their creators come from), and both having recreations of these cities in their comic books.
</li><li> In the 2000 AD comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zombo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zombo">Zombo</a></em>, it's implied that the Earth government is largely American in nature, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> is President of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica">United Space of America</a>, but there's also a "Shadow" President, a term which is not really used outside the United Kingdom to denote the opposition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in the Italian comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DylanDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DylanDog">Dylan Dog</a></em>. The writers usually take great pains to respect the comic's London setting, but over the course of the time there's been an oddly high number of clues/riddles/whatever that needed to be solved in Italian<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2o0op');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2o0op" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2o0op');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The comic, of course, is written in Italian but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">the characters are supposed to be speaking English</a></span> just as a character who can speak Italian happens to be nearby.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A lot of fanfic writers will forget or disregard where book/movie/show/etc. is canonically set, placing it instead in their home country. See the "Fanfiction" folder in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">We All Live in America</a> for more.
</li><li> Among its other alterations to canon, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LightAndDarkTheAdventuresOfDarkYagami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LightAndDarkTheAdventuresOfDarkYagami">Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami</a></em> immediately establishes the story as being in the US rather than in Japan when Light notices that a car cannot be American because it does not have the wheel on the same side.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4077485/1/Minstrel_Show">This fic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> looks at the reasons for this trope's use in the Michael Bay <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> films, by asking why there are differences at all. "White American male" is seen as the dominant subculture, but in this case, it's still a conscious choice—and, sadly, probably the right one, because it's the one that most people are subconsciously more likely to accept.
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em> fanfics are set in the fictional suburb of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne">Melbourne</a> that the show itself is set in. Jack Rudd's fic <em>When Winter Shows Her Hand</em> is set in the mostly obscure English town of Yeovil. Guess which town Jack Rudd grew up in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal">My Immortal</a></em> does this constantly. For starters, Hot Topic doesn't even have a branch in the UK, or at the very least never calls that branch "Hot Topic". Every band mentioned is <em>very</em> American, and it is considered notable that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry</a>/Vampire has an English accent (not even bothering to tell us what <em>kind</em> of English accent). The entire "prep" subculture is American, the closest UK equivalent to "preps" being "sloanes", more or less. Of course, there's also the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">the timescale is messed up too.</a>

The final attack takes place on American Independence Day, and the American president, who states that America's Independence Day will become a global independence day. Film director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich">Roland Emmerich</a> intended the speech as a call to universal brotherhood, but to many non-Americans, it sounds more like a call for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">Americanization</a>.
</li><li> Most Japanese <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> (and Godzilla-related) movies take place in Japan. This is generally explained as Godzilla making his home in Japan, so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">kaiju</a> end up going there to defeat Godzilla and have free reign over the rest of the world.

When the city became too expensive to film in, however, he dropped the favoritism and makes films set all around the world.

And she's not even a US national.
</li><li> Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a> is famous for filming all his movies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a>, even stories set in the US (and especially, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Middle Earth</a>). While Jackson traveled to New York City before filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005">King Kong (2005)</a></em> and visited the Empire State Building, the entire movie itself was filmed in New Zealand. The only times he's ever left New Zealand and filmed elsewhere has been some filming in Pennsylvania he did for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones">The Lovely Bones</a></em> and filming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanHolm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanHolm">Ian Holm</a>'s scenes at Pinewood in London in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, as the health of both actors was too frail for them to travel to Wellington.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaneBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaneBlack">Shane Black</a> usually sets his movies in Los Angeles (both written, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon">Lethal Weapon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBoyScout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBoyScout">The Last Boy Scout</a></em>, and directed, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissKissBangBang">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNiceGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNiceGuys">The Nice Guys</a></em>), where he's lived since high school. One of the few aversions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongKissGoodnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongKissGoodnight">The Long Kiss Goodnight</a></em>, still fits for opening in Black's home state of Pennsylvania.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is based on New York in the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">the movies</a> place him in California instead - from the headquarters of Marvel Comics to one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Studios</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>: The original novel is set in a redwood forest in Northern California, but the Canadian film adaptation takes place in a rainy Canadian forest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist">not that you're likely to notice</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571">U-571</a></em> infamously told the heroic story of the American capture of a working enigma machine from the titular Nazi U-boat. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">real event</a> the film was based on was the British capture of U-110, which occurred before America had even entered the war.

Applegate</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, it's not really made clear what's going on outside the States during the entirety of the war. We know that at least one major head of state outside the U.S. is a Controller (the President of the U.S. isn't, though), but except for, like, four missions outside the country, the kids mostly ignore everything beyond U.S. borders. Or more than a day's journey from their home town, for that matter. In this case, the trope is justified, since a group of kids too young to drive would have no way to leave their town, much less their country, without alerting adults to their secret mission.
</li><li> One of the oldest ones in the book - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>. The Martian invasion nearly succeeds with the world only being saved when germs cause the invaders' demise. With a whole planet to invade, the Martians pick north <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a>. Mostly justified, as it was the capital of the world's biggest superpower of the time. However, the invasion only actually covers a small part of the Home Counties, culminating in a chase into and partial evacuation of London. Most of Britain remains untouched (and resistance has actually been quite successful so far) while the rest of the world is unlikely to even be aware anything has happened, but Wells' home region being conquered is treated as if the entire world has fallen. However, he freely enjoys letting the Martians destroy specific places where he spent an unhappy childhood.
</li><li> Brian Jacques, the author of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series, is a born-and-bred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Liverpudlian</a>. His multitude of jobs has led him through a multitude of Western English countrysides, and he (self-admittedly) shows off these anglicisms throughout the setting of his books and their characters (complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland">Highlanders</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry">Somerset natives</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">West-coast seafarers</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">In all but name, actually</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em> books place St Louis at their center.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> sets the majority of his stories in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftCountry">native Maine</a>, and more specifically the town of Derry, with seven books set in the town and an additional <em>seventeen</em> referencing the town by name. And when he started spending part of the year in Florida, he started setting some of his stories there. Several books were set in or around Boulder, Colorado when he lived in Colorado for a while. And all of them are set in the U.S. (except the ones set in fantasy worlds that are often implied to be parallel versions of America) and his entire body of work has only three notable non-American characters, the British-born Richard Straker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot">'Salem's Lot</a></em>, the English Nick Hopewell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLangoliers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLangoliers">The Langoliers</a></em> and the German Kurt Dussander in <em>Apt Pupil</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>: Narnia proper has a lot of English culture (possibly due to the first King and Queen of Narnia being a London cabbie and his wife), even among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">Talking Animals</a>, and English food — even animals that should be vegetarian will cook and eat fish or bacon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> also depicts Middle Eastern food in Calormen. He makes it clear that the homesick Narnians think it's distasteful foreign muck — or at least gives the impression of being nothing but dessert courses — but points out that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">You might not have liked it,</a> but Shasta did." Shasta grew up in Calormen. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">The books were written before Middle Eastern food became popular in the UK.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> gives the impression that the entire universe is structured with respect to Medieval Italy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>. Notably, the lowest level of hell is shared by Judas, Brutus, and Cassius, because Dante saw the fall of Rome as a sin near the depravity of the betrayal of Christ.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> books, the Eastern Kingdoms are heavily based on Hungary. Author Steven Brust is very proud of his Hungarian ancestry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, Voldemort conquers all of wizarding Britain, which is essentially treated as though it were the same thing as conquering the whole world. Not to mention the fact that throughout the series Voldemort fights a war to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> in which practically everyone on both sides is British (a few foreign wizards on Voldemort's side notwithstanding). Australia is assumed to be safe since Hermione sent her parents there. We can only guess whether Britain is the wizarding world's superpower and/or still rules over the Wizarding British Empire, or Voldemort taking over Britain is a prelude to a bid for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">world domination</a>, or that the only reason it's bad is that the heroes live in Britain.
</li><li> Also, the vast majority of creatures in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> are native to the British Isles, and some are specifically described as unique to a particular county, isle, or forest. Meanwhile, beasts native to other continents are seldom given a more specific home range than "China", "Peru", or even "Africa". Possibly an in-character example, if Rowling deliberately imposed this trope on Newt Scamander. The foreword explains that the list in the book is not comprehensive, and Scamander is writing for British wizards, so it's reasonable for him to show provincialism in this case.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges">Quidditch Through the Ages</a></em> notes that there are dozens of teams from other places such as the US and South America but these wizards are never referenced in the books ever. Apparently, during the whole series, they decided it wasn't really that important to butt in. And not to mention <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em> introduces two other wizarding schools in France and Norway with equal prestige to Hogwarts and they only receive minor references in the rest of the series.
</li><li> Europe has a disproportionate amount of the major eleven wizarding schools with three. There's one the Northeastern US that serves North America, one in Brazil for South America, another in Japan, and one in Uganda, and three unknown.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4uluz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4uluz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4uluz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Although one has been implied to be in Australia</span> This means the British Isles (around seventy million inhabitants) and the entirety of Africa (1.3 billion) both need just one school, and there are, at most, three schools for the 4.4 billion of continental Asia. Although to be fair, it's also noted that there are plenty of smaller schools around the world. The rationale is that the global wizarding community is so small that in more far-flung places and smaller countries, having a dedicated school just isn't feasible. As for more densely populated places, there's just not a place to put a huge school that needs to be hidden. Places like this either teach their kids at home or do correspondence with the closest nearby school.
</li><li> Also somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em>Goblet</em>, when Harry realizes how stupid he was for not realizing there must be wizards in other countries too.
</li><li> Before Voldemort, the dark wizard Grindelwald was incredibly feared. His influence didn't seem to have reached England though, and the most impact his reign seemed to have was his defeat being a bit of trivia on the back of Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card. It's inverted in the seventh book, where Krum's reaction to Grindelwald's sign (actually the symbol of the Deathly Hallows) indicates that wizards in his home country Bulgaria still remember all too well the damage done by Grindelwald (he says Grindelwald murdered his grandfather), to the point where students who draw the symbol on walls as a joke tend to get beaten up by the descendants of Grindelwald's victims.
</li><li> Although with Grindelwald, it could be due to Voldemort's greater extremism (and Rowling herself said that his downfall being in 1945 was intentionally done, drawing parallels between him and the Nazis).
</li><li> Even within a British context, <em>Harry Potter</em> is very provincial. Aside from the undisclosed location in Scotland where Hogwarts is located, virtually all the important places in the story are in the extreme south of England. Harry lives in Surrey, Ron lives in Devon, and Malfoy lives in Wiltshire. The first third of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> takes Harry from Surrey to Devon, then to London for a couple of chapters, a few chapters in nondescript woodland, and then to a fictional West Country village, then to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, then back to Devon, then to Wiltshire, and finally to Shell Cottage, in Cornwall, before finally going to Gringotts in London, and then Hogwarts. For those keeping track, 95% of their England-spanning journey takes place in the West Country. J.K. Rowling grew up in the area.
</li><li> There are two scenes in the last book that take place in Central Europe. Voldemort murders a German-speaking family (although its not said if its in Germany itself or another German speaking country) in his search for the Elder Wand towards the beginning of the book and then he goes to Grindelwalds prison which is in Austria at about the 2/3 mark of the book.
</li><li> There's finally an attempt at expanding the wizarding world with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> movie, set in 1920s New York City... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">even if it was filmed in England</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality">and starring predominantly British actors.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald">The sequel</a> did the same, set in Paris but even the characters are mostly Brits.
</li><li> Pointed out by Harry when he discovers that Voldemort has created six Horcruxes and hidden them to ensure his immortality. Harry immediately remarks the Horcruxes could be hidden anywhere in the world for all they know and would be impossible to ever find. As it turns out, none of them were outside the United Kingdom. Only one of them was even outside of <em>England.</em> Though somewhat justified in that Voldemort is English, and due to his massive ego hid his Horcruxes in locations that had personal importance to him rather than pragmatically hiding them in random places far away.
</li></ul></li><li> It's implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> series that the people of Panem represents the entire human race since no other country other than Panem is mentioned in the narration. Panem itself is located in a severely reduced North American continent.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> is vast and large, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s British outlook comes through very clearly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a> are depicted based on British attitudes to their real-world inspirations.
</li><li> Used in-universe in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novels. The editor of Cain's memoirs has to insert text from other works to give the readers the big picture, often lamenting on how Cain always focuses only on events affecting himself.
</li><li> A disproportionate number of gay-themed romances take place in California or New England. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Iowa">But perhaps more will be set in the Midwest now.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Heinlein</a> was so terrified of doing this that he only set his novels in places that he had personally visited, or were completely made up. He did write a bit about Mars, but his depictions thereof probably fall into the last category.
</li><li> In the illustrated children's books <em>Barbapapa</em>, when the titular character returns from a space trip looking for a partner, we are shown Europe with only one point of reference: the Eiffel Tower. Three guesses where the author lived...
<div class="indent"> <strong>Harry:</strong> All my stuff is there.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising">The Dark Is Rising</a></em> everything important in the grand struggle for world dominion between good and evil apparently occurs in Great Britain (Ireland doesn't even come into it), specifically in three tiny villages in Cornwall, Buckinghamshire and Wales; even Scotland is only mentioned in two sentences over a five-book series. The U.S. is totally irrelevant except that (1) one of the main characters has an uncle who emigrated there and (2) the U.S. sends backs its share of magically clueless tourists to the U.K. (represented by the aforementioned uncle's American wife). Lastly, while there are Old Ones (the race of magical servants of the Light/good wizards) all over the world, the ones in countries other than the U.K. don't <em>do</em> anything except show up as part of a crowd in visions that our British Old One hero occasionally has, and one Jamaican Old One posts a magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> back to our hero in England. Rome is mentioned, but only in relation to the Roman invasion of Britain, and India is only relevant because there's one scene in the last novel where one of the heroes defends a British Indian child (the son of immigrant parents) from some bullies.
</li><li> The most commonly used flume on the Earth territories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePendragonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePendragonAdventure">The Pendragon Adventure</a></em> is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">The Bronx</a>, a quick drive away from the main character's hometown of Stony Brook, New York. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The other was created during the series, and it is in Stony Brook, itself.</span> The author, D.J.

</li><li> The works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRankin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRankin">Robert Rankin</a> see myriad supernatural disasters threaten the world, most of which are centered on the London borough of Brentford, also notable as the area in which one Robert Rankin spent his childhood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> is a lot like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series. While magical persons are not restricted to the author's homeland (in this case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>), everything important happens there, and while Geser and Zabulon are literally only the heads of the Light and Dark Others of Moscow, in practice, they function as the leaders of Light and Darkness in general.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodiPicoult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodiPicoult">Jodi Picoult</a>, New England is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySistersKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySistersKeeper">sick</a> or neglected children, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent">Knight Templar Parents</a> and various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePact">lonely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VanishingActs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VanishingActs">lawyers with dysfunctional backgrounds.</a> Picoult was born on Long Island, NY and now lives in New Hampshire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em>, despite revolving around Greek gods, is set in the modern US. The farthest place away from the US that the series shows is when Percy dreams of seeing Rachel spelling messages in a nondescript <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheCaribbeanMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheCaribbeanMon">Caribbean beach</a> (her family is vacationing there). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in the first book, where Percy is told that the Greek gods relocate to whoever happens to be the current Western powerhouse at the moment.
<ul><li> Thankfully averted in its sequel series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a></em>. The first book sees the heroes travel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec">Quebec City</a> while the second has a brief stop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver">Vancouver</a> while the characters get to the destination of their adventure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alaska" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alaska">Alaska</a>, not to mention introducing a Canadian and a Puerto Rican as main characters. Then there's the third book and beyond, which sees a voyage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece">Greece</a>, which means plenty of pitstops including: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Italy">Italy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Croatia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malta">Malta</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portugal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portugal">Portugal</a>. The aforementioned Caribbean is also finally explored when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PuertoRico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PuertoRico">Puerto Rico</a> is visited in the final book.
</li><li> Sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> seems to follow in THO's footsteps, as it breaks the provincialism from day one: the first book opens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a>, the second has the heroes visit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs">Saint Petersburg</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egypt</a>, while the final book, with the exception of the prologue and epilogue, takes place entirely in Egypt, which to the present day still acts as the capital of the Egyptian gods, unlike the Greeks. Oh, and Sadie is British too, and this fact is even reflected in her narration, which uses British English.
</li><li> However, the other sister series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</a></em> seems to have fallen back to this trope, as it's said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston">Boston</a>, due to a peculiar history with the Vikings, is the word-to-word <em>Hub of the universe</em>, or rather, the Nine Worlds. The human main characters also fall into this, as both Magnus and Sam are both (Bostonian) Americans. Although, this is not as obvious as the PJTO series by virtue of not playing Boston highly at all; most of the events happen in other worlds parallel to Boston, probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler">Magnus is dead</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> may seem to suffer from this; for the first six books of the series or so, it seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> is the site of all the supernatural threats and disasters in the country, and every major supernatural power in the world has a vacation home or bunker there. Then the seventh book reveals that Harry and the reader were almost completely oblivious to a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretWar">Secret War</a> (that <em>started</em> in Chicago, but anyways...) and some very important action has been happening on other continents. Additionally, the strongest of factions are noted for having a presence everywhere, Chicago simply being the place that Harry Dresden has "jurisdiction" over; and Harry ends up leaving the area for important, climactic battles at least a couple times in later books. Also, it's explicitly noted in the books that Chicago (and the Lake Michigan area generally) <em>are</em> supernaturally unusual, the area is thick with ley-lines and strange things that were present from time immemorial, and furthermore, the role of Chicago as a global 'cross-roads' as amplified the effect. Ironically, series creator Jim Butcher never visited Chicago until he finished the first book. He lives in a suburb of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KansasCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KansasCity">Kansas City</a>.
</li><li> Another Chicago example would be the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> series. Forget the world, forget the U.S., forget even the freaking Midwest. The series <em>never ever</em> steps outside of Chicago City as defined today (i.e. most of Cook County and a sliver of DuPage County to house the O'Hare airport), even though the series is set in a distant future. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">that's provincialism in location only</a>. If we go by characters, there are a handful who are explicitly stated <em>not</em> to be Chicagoan: Nita, who came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indianapolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indianapolis">Indy</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Natalie Prior, and thus her children Tris and Caleb</span>, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee">Milwaukeeans</a>.
</li><li> A subtle example: The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaridAudran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaridAudran">Marîd Audran</a></em> novels by George Alec Effinger are cyberpunk books with an unusual Arabic setting; most of the action takes place in the Levant. However, the books' main metropolis, the Budayeen, and its inhabitants are patterned after the French Quarter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>, where Effinger lived. It's particularly clear in the characters' dialect, which will be familiar to New Orleanians or fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkulduggeryPleasant">Skulduggery Pleasant</a></em> takes place in Ireland. Mostly around Dublin. It is apparently the "birthplace" of magic, and impliedly has more magical artifacts, happenings, and general weird stuff happening than anyplace else on Earth. Many nations would like to gain control of it, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">the US</a> usually mentioned.
</li><li> The Nuala Anne McGrail novels start in Ireland (Nuala is a somewhat psychic woman from there, by ancestry) and move to Chicago. They were written by an Irish-American priest who lives in Chicago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyWorldMap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyWorldMap">Fantasy World Map</a> is in the shape of Florida, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> lives.
<ul><li> Began to be averted later in the series when the connection to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Mundania</a>" has shifted variously to Korea and Italy (notably during the Punic Wars), and it's shown that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Mundanes</a> who enter Xanth will perceive it as being the same shape as whichever peninsula they entered from. It's still <strong>usually</strong> Florida, though. Anyone from the modern era who enters Xanth will by definition do so from Florida.
</li></ul></li><li> All of the central characters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MediochreQSethSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MediochreQSethSeries">Mediochre Q Seth Series</a></em> live in Edinburgh, Scotland (although, interestingly, <em>none</em> of them have lived there all their life). The author is Scottish and grew up in Edinburgh. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the About the Author section of the first book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TenSixtySixAndAllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TenSixtySixAndAllThat">1066 and All That</a></em> is simultaneously a history of England and a spoof of history as taught in English schools. As such, the book says that (East) Indian History began in the 18th century and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> (led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DickWhittington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DickWhittington">Dick Whittington</a>) "prevented America from having any more History."
</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot">Meg Cabot</a>'s books either take place in New York, where she lives, or Indiana, where she grew up.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em> series takes place in Tulsa, which is where the authors live. This becomes a bit silly when it's implied in one book that of all the House of Nights all around the world, including various famous historic sites in Europe, Aphrodite's socially-conscious ladder-climbing parents consider it far more prestigious for her to attend the House of Night in Tulsa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em>: The series takes place on several dimensions, none of which are Earth, but all the pop-culture references are from 20th century America.

</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KerstinPflieger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KerstinPflieger">Kerstin Pflieger</a> does this with her fantasy novels - apparently, the most important vampire village is somewhere in the Black Forest, and the device that prevents humans from being overrun by supernatural creatures is located in Heidelberg. The organisation that researches paranormal activity operates in different German cities, but no mention is made of other countries in Europe. However, as Germans read lots of translated American novels, this doesn't lead to the question why the supernatural never happens elsewhere, but rather to a kind of satisfaction that, after all, supernatural things can happen in Germany, too.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jam">Jam</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw">Yahtzee Croshaw</a> takes place in Brisbane, Australia, which was (and is, as of 2015) his place of residence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeveBinchy">Maeve Binchy</a></em> set all but one of her books in her native Ireland. And the one that wasn't — <em>Nights Of Rain And Stars</em> — still featured a cast of Irish people.
</li><li> Up until the third book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> series takes place exclusively in New York City, and all of the main characters, with the exception of Magnus, are New Yorkers too. The third book, <em>City of Glass</em>, finally averts this as it introduces Idris, a fictional European country sandwiched between France, Germany, and Switzerland, and the homeworld of the Shadowhunters. However, most of the (main) series alternate only between these two locations, up until Los Angeles is seen, if only briefly, in <em>City of Heavenly Fire</em>.
<ul><li> Its prequel series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfernalDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInfernalDevices">The Infernal Devices</a></em>, completely averts this. Even though the main protagonist is an American, the entire series is set in the United Kingdom, and her new friends (and villains) are therefore British.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Regarding <em>telenovelas</em>, most Brazilian soap operas take place in Rio de Janeiro (HQ of the biggest TV station, Globo) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaoPaulo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaoPaulo">São Paulo</a> (where the other major stations are located).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denmark">Denmark</a>, between 1/5 and 2/5 of the population lives in the capital Copenhagen and its suburbs. If you only know Denmark from television, however, you would think the number was much higher. Almost all Danish TV series take place primarily in Greater Copenhagen. Copenhagen is located on the island of Zealand, and it's noteworthy how many Copenhageners (especially in fiction, but also quite a few in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>) think that everything important happens only in Copenhagen, and that the geographically largest region of Denmark, Jutland (with a population number that is actually the same as Zealand), is just a big peninsula filled with nothing but fields, farms, cow, pigs and mentally backwards country bumpkins with weird dialects. Essentially the Danish equivalent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>. While some of the most rural areas of Jutland may have shades of this, the inhabitants of Aarhus (Denmark's second-largest city) have a city lifestyle more similar to Copenhageners than to farmers, and most inhabitants in other larger towns aren't country bumpkins either.
<ul><li> However, a very large percentage of Danish media is centered in Copenhagen. If you are something big in terms of media, you more or less have to live there if you don't want to commute every day. And when all of the screenwriters live in Copenhagen, it may be easier for them to write a city they know.
</li><li> The same thing happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden">Sweden</a> too. Almost every TV show or movie will take place in Stockholm, Gothenburg, or maybe Malmö (mostly due to the proximity to Copenhagen).
</li></ul></li><li> Many Russian TV shows are set in one of the following settings: a) Moscow, St. Petersburg, or suburbs thereof, b) an unnamed and imaginary rural community utterly lacking geographical coordinates of any sort, c) Abroad, with a capital A, characterized by either rampant espionage, crime, international terrorism, and other miscellaneous <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackinessEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackinessEnsues">Wackiness Ensues</a>, and/or exaggerated national stereotypes (hijabs and/or pickups and shotguns for everyone, no exceptions whatsoever).
</li><li> The Earth Alliance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, The Twelve Colonies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>, the Federation from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, the future Earth of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> (and probably many other examples) all have the same political system that the US has. A presidential regime with a president and a vice-president elected for 4 years, a line of succession in case of death of the president and members of government called "secretaries", while this kind of system is not the most common among democracies. Futurama's Earth has even the same flag! This led to the sub-trope: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedSpaceOfAmerica">United Space of America</a></em>.

<ul><li> Except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> show has been set in southern California. This does avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">California Doubling</a>.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The documentary series <em>America: The Story of Us</em>, is devoted not simply to the <em>European</em> presence in what is now the United States, but specifically to the presence of <em>English-speaking</em> Europeans. It begins with the 1607 landing at Jamestown, as if Cortés or Ponce de Leon or the city of St. Augustine, Florida (founded 1565) had simply never happened. Justified as it's specifically a documentary about how the <em>United States</em> arose and developed, <em>not</em> a documentary European colonization of the Americas altogether. Florida didn't become U.S. territory until 1819, so Florida's history under Spanish rule doesn't become relevant for the program's purpose until the First Seminole War. It'd be like starting off a history of the Roman Empire with the construction of the pyramids in Egypt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist">The Blacklist</a>:</em> Despite the task force being set up to catch the most dangerous criminals in the world, nearly all of the action takes place in the United States, and while many Blacklisters are non-American, Americans are disproportionately represented on the list (to date, at least). There are allusions to Blacklisters operating all over the world, and the task force is willing to operate abroad to pursue either criminals or its investigations, but the bulk of any episode will take place in America. Sometimes this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as some Blacklisters are based out of America, and occasionally it will turn out that Red actually helped lure them to the US to make the apprehension easier but in most cases its just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> that a Blacklister happens to be doing a job in the US which therefore gives the task force an excuse and opportunity to go after them.
</li><li> Every episode of the latter two seasons of French Canadian sci-fi comedy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DansUneGalaxiePresDeChezVous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DansUneGalaxiePresDeChezVous">Dans une galaxie près de chez vous</a></em> opens with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>-like speech which includes the line: "The planetary federation turned to the first world power... <em>Canada</em>. It's <em>Canadian</em> know-how that allows the launch, on October 28th, 2034, of the spaceship Romano-Fafard which left Earth towards the confines of the universe." This line appears in the latter two seasons because the Canadian government refused to renew the show's grant due to a lack of "Canadian content". The show itself has plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">Creator Provincialism</a>, but it's not usually that blatant and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> as a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, Britain and parts thereof are generally the centre of the universe  particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon">London</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMidlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMidlands">The Midlands</a>. For a show about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, there's also a suspicious amount of preference for the Doctor going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextSundayAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextSundayAD">Next Sunday A.D.</a>, particularly to recruit his companions.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep">"Fury from the Deep"</a>, a Patrick Troughton story, which opened with a funny sequence of Victoria griping that the TARDIS always seems to end up on Earth, and Jamie (a Scot) griping that it always ends up in <em>England</em>.
</li><li> Lampshaded via the acting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E1Robot">"Robot"</a>, which hinges on the ridiculous premise that America, Russia, and China have all given their nuclear missile codes to British politicians as part of a disarmament treaty.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E3PyramidsOfMars">"Pyramids of Mars"</a>, an Egyptian-themed story, still takes place in the UK.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned">"Voyage of the Damned"</a> features the Doctor wincing when he discovers where the ship may end up crashing: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buckingham Palace</span>. And at the climax of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">"Journey's End"</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his reaction to Earth being the last planet left  and the one that didn't get sent back with the other easier alien planet-theft device  is "Oh... guess which one?"</span>
</li><li> Space travel is overwhelmingly British in <em>Doctor Who</em>. One of the few exceptions is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">"The Waters of Mars"</a>: the base is a realistic mix of nationalities, with the majority being American, but also including a Pakistani, a German, and an Australian... and, naturally, one of the few British residents is the commander.
</li><li> The resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a> UNIT is, despite supposedly being an international coalition, seemingly 95% British. This might be a case of episodes being set in Britain, in the US 95% of UNIT might be American. In the Third Doctor era, it was described as a UN agency with cover as a counter-terrorism force, the Brigadier's superior was not British, and one of the novels referred to a UNIT SAC (Supreme Allied Commander), but the national contingents could be freely withdrawn from UNIT command.
</li><li> The Torchwood Institute is British, having been founded by Queen Victoria. The spin-off show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> is set in Wales, resulting in lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff">Aliens in Cardiff</a>.
</li><li> Lampshaded and justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DoctorWhoMagazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></em> short story "Useless Things", which explains that standard operating procedure for alien invasions is to start out in a rural area on a small island, move to the capital once you've established a beachhead, and then move on to countries that take up a sizable proportion of the globe from there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a>: The Series</em> is a joint French and American production. The series constantly switches between two main settings: an unnamed North American city and Paris. (The former is actually based on two cities, Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington. Thus the nickname "Seacouver".) While Immortals and their Watchers are supposedly active around the world, there is little mention of any events outside these two locations. A handful of episodes take place in Scotland or feature brief scenes in the Ukraine, Iraq, etc., but that is it for present day content. Flashbacks were better at having characters and events placed around the world. Even if the main character can just wait around for other Immortals to come to him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne">There Can Be Only One</a>, the lack of movement still qualifies as playing this trope straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em>, like its sister franchise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>, has everything important happen in Japan. Some series have excuses: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderHibiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderHibiki">Hibiki</a></em> focuses on Oni and various Japanese spirits, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kabuto</a></em>'s monsters are aliens who came to Earth on a meteor that landed in the Shibuya district of Tokyo, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Fourze</a></em> focuses on a single school because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is its owner, the teahers are his minions, and they hand out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> trinkets to students. Some series aren't quite so justified, though; mostly the Showa series, where the supposedly international terrorist organizations would only attack Japan instead of going after a country that <em>didn't</em> have a costumed superhero protecting it.
<ul><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamenRiderSpirits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamenRiderSpirits">Kamen Rider Spirits</a></em>, the evil space empire Badan attacks the whole world, with the Kamen Riders and their allies splitting up to take them on wherever they appear. The attack is still mostly concentrated on Tokyo, though this is because it was the seat of Badan's power in the past and they see it as "reclaiming what's ours". Even earlier, the first chapter is set in New York City, where Rider ally Kazuya Taki has been telling local kids about the Kamen Riders, causing at least one to muse about how much it sucks that the US doesn't have one.
</li><li> The Showa Era shows did sorta-kinda explain this: in the first show when the original hero had to be written out of the show due to the actor being injured, he was replaced by another Rider with the handwave that the original was fighting Shocker plots in other countries. It was implied this was the reason the heroes of previous shows only showed up once in a while in their successors' shows, that they were also fighting the current villain group, but conveniently offscreen most of the time.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet">Animal Planet</a> documentary series <em>North America</em> was supposedly going to showcase the wildlife of the entire continent. In actuality, aside from some obligatory scenes of polar bears hunting seals in the Canadian Arctic, the entirety of the series was about animals found in the United States and ignored all the parts of the continent found south of the US/Mexico border.
</li><li> One way the quiz show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyConnect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyConnect">Only Connect</a></em> plays up its difference to other shows is by making sure everyone knows it's filmed not in one of the UK's media powerhouses like London, Glasgow or Salford but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales">Welsh capital</a>, Cardiff. The host often asks teams what they've got up to in Cardiff and makes frequent references to the city and to Wales in general, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of insisting that dragons are real.
</li><li> The Mexican soap opera <em>El Pecado de Oyuki</em> (Oyuki's Sin) was one of the first Mexican TV series that doesn't take place in Mexico since almost all the characters are Japanese. There's a few foreigners, but all of them are Europeans (mostly British) but we don't see <em>a single Mexican character</em> in the TV series (Besides the fact that the forests of Cuernavaca were used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">to simulate Edo-era Japan.</a>)
</li><li> In every season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, all alien attacks take place in one town. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">five</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">seasons</a>, it was the same town every year—Angel Grove. Since season seven, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Lost Galaxy</a></em>, it has at least been a new town each year. Most of these cities (including Angel Grove) are located in California - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">as near as we can tell, anyway</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> does place some of them outside of CA, but still in the Western US (in states such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Washington</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Colorado</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Oregon</a>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>'s city of Corinth has some Easter Eggs pointing to Boston, the hometown of that season's first Executive Producer. Only <em>Lost Galaxy</em>'s city of Terra Venture definitively escapes this, being a space colony.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> made a rod for its own back by establishing that Sam Beckett could speak several foreign languages. He should have been fine with leaping outside the US, but he hardly ever did—not even to Canada. The last season did have some episodes set in more exotic locales, but there was usually an American connection. (In one show, Sam is adrift in the Aegean Sea—with Brooke Shields. Lucky man.)

When the US finally decides to let the wider world in on what's been going on, many of the other world leaders are incredulous at America's arrogance in taking unilateral action that affects the entire world. And when the Air Force suggests that a multi-national Stargate effort should be headed by America, most of them balk outright.

<ul><li> In franchise lore, the warp drive, the semi-sentient computer, and the transporter were all invented by Americans. At least one Enterprise executive was influenced by a series of essays by Sal Lagonia that suggested the Federation was likely formed from the victorious powers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>, so the Anglo-Amercancentrism may have been intentional.
</li><li> While all of the shows in the franchise have made an effort to include characters from around the world, the majority of them are still American. Out of the seven main Captains, five have been American, the only exception being Picard (French) and Philippa Georgiou (Malaysian).
</li><li> Starfleet Academy and Starfleet HQ are all set in San Francisco. Thus, when a crew goes to Earth, it usually goes to San Francisco. Even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> is involved, and the crews go to Earth before Star Fleet existed, they still often wind up on San Francisco.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>
<ul><li> The title sequence is biased towards American space and aviation achievements. The Russians (or even the German V2 rocket and the British jet engine for that matter) seem to have been ignored.
</li><li> In the <em>Enterprise</em> episode "Zero Hour", the villains (a group of alien Nazis) are revealed to have invaded the majority of America and are currently making a final push across the country. A map in their headquarters shows that their "invasion" inexplicably stops at the borders of both Canada and Mexico and that the invasion is solely focused on conquering America.

While the other seasons can kind of be excused as none of the events that are happening are particularly notable in-universe and could be happening elsewhere as well, <strong>ALL</strong> of the events related to the Apocalypse and the final battle between good and evil take place in the US. Even with a limited TV budget, you'd think they could've at least spent a day in Canada or something. Considering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> is mainly filmed in Canada...
<ul><li> Actually, kind of averted: we hear about seals being broken all over the world, and as for the rest, well, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Apocalypse is kind of centered around Winchesters, with Dean and Sam being Lucifer's and Michael's true vessels and all</span>.
</li><li> Season 6 onwards still sets most of the action in America, even though the Winchesters are nothing but hateful annoyances to most factions at this point. Despite both Heaven and Hell going through civil wars and various apocalyptic monsters breaking into the world to cause havoc, all of the villains still feel the need to set off their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> in the American Mid-West. Crowley, notably, isn't even American-he is Scottish, and his "meat-suit" (i.e. his actor) is British.

</li><li> Wrestler rankings, while more inclusive than those of belts, are not free from signs of provincialism. The PWI 500 stands out in this regard because a lot of people scurry to the stands every year to see who made it but very few people seem to understand just what it is measuring (it's supposed to take wins and losses into account first and foremost with quality of competition, skill of the wrestler and such being lesser factors). Everyone can tell working for a company with a big USA TV deal is the most significant factor though.

<ul><li> The alleged issue of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_bias">"East Coast bias"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in North American sports, which claims that, since most sportswriters are based in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>, they give undue focus to teams in the eastern half of the country (and particularly franchises in the Northeast) and short shrift to teams out west.
</li><li> The naming of the "World Series" in baseball is a classic example. Partially justified, at least until recent decades, in that baseball was played in very few countries outside the US, but still... (This is to some degree the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a> at work: the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was famous for its bombast, and styling the national baseball championship the "World Series" was wholly unremarkable even for those who realized it was silly. If baseball were a new thing, the "World Series" would most certainly not be MLB's championship.) For what it's worth, one of the teams to win the World Series, the Toronto Blue Jays, are based in Canada...who as of 2004 are the <em>only</em> MLB franchise to operate outside the US.
<ul><li> Actually there is kind of a reason (though a twisted one) to calling the champions of Major League Baseball (and the NFL for that matter) "world champion" - there simply is no other team in that sport that could claim to be better. That's also the reason why the predecessor to the current Super Bowl was called the "AFL-NFL World Championship Game". The American and National Football League were the only professional Football Leagues at that time and naturally, the one who won a duel between both champions would be the best in the world.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53981');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53981" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53981');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Canadian Football League plays a separate sport.</span> It can be argued that the "world champion" crowned by the International Federation of American Football (currently the US) is not a world champion at all, because no NFL talent is allowed to compete and hence the best players are excluded.
</li><li> Things might be changing with the World Series, however, as of baseball's inclusion into the Olympics for the 2020 games.
</li></ul></li><li> Any sport mostly focused on one country/region for that matter. Up until the 1960s, there was no Ice Hockey outside the NHL according to US newspapers. And it took quite some time (and Dirk Nowitzki) to realize that Basketball is played outside the NBA.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note698u9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note698u9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note698u9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The NBA at least has the excuse that, ever since pros were allowed in international competitions, the USA has been obscenely dominant in basketball. They win most competitions with ease and occasionally without the absolute best American players due to either injury or indifference. While pretty much any non-American player who is on the level of top American players will be found playing in the NBA as well.</span> Baseball is a different story, but American Football is still called "NFL Football" <strong>even in other places where it is played</strong> - all that despite there being a European Championship of American Football since the 1980s.
</li><li> The Australian Football League (the premier competition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>) has 18 teams, of which 10 are based in Victoria (and all but one of those are based in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne">Melbourne</a>). Somewhat justified in that the League is an expansion of the Victorian Football League, and Victoria is the birthplace and home of the game.
</li><li> The Argentinian Primera Division consists of 20 teams from which 12 are concentrated in the Greater Buenos Aires province (from which the tournament came into fruition and its oldest teams were founded); these clubs have amassed more than 70% of all national league titles from an area that represents less than 13% from the rest of the country. Though this is understandable and logic given that the Greater Buenos Aires area contains one third of the total population of Argentina, there was actually a considerable bias towards the Bonaerense clubs during the 35-plus year tenure of late AFA president Julio Grondona (a huge name not only in AFA, but also on CONMEBOL and FIFA), who blocked funding and development of the clubs outside the Argentinian capital.

<ul><li> The game has its default setting in Seattle, where FASA has some of their offices. Part of the reason for putting the location there was that, in the 1980s, Seattle was something of an "everytown" that didn't have a reputation for anything specific.
</li><li> FASA's official headquarters are in Chicago, which became a big part of the setting fiction when an invasion of magical insect spirits decimated the city. The nuclear bomb blast that created "Bug City" in Chicago was detonated at the FASA offices.

Campbell</a> died, therefore not encouraging science fiction writers, which in turn meant that students were not inspired to go into the sciences and science hasn't developed since the end of World War II. The version in the revamped <em>GURPS Infinite Worlds</em> lampshaded the provincialism in this concept by pointing out that since science stopped all over the world, not just in the United States, some suspect a different cause.

There's also an exact replica of the Scotland's Forth Road Bridge in San Fierro, which is placed as the game's equivalent of San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge, as well as an adjacent replica of Forth Rail Bridge (whereas the real-life San Francisco has no such thing). Rockstar North is based in Edinburgh and Dundee and evidently like their in-jokes.

This complaint sometimes extends to the Florida teams in the NFL (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite">Dallas Cowboys</a>) getting higher ratings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em> as well, as Tiburon makes both games.

For reference, many of the streets are blocked by a single, longitudinal car across the road. When's the last time you [Americans] saw a road that narrow, especially in a city of over 100,000 residents? Further games in the series that revisit Raccoon, however, seem to retcon them to the proper width.
<ul><li> Also from the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, the use of green herbs as healing items. In Japan and other Eastern countries, this is a staple of traditional medicine. In America, the most common medicine associated with this is illegal in 37 states (and all 50 at the time of the first few games' release). Cue weed jokes.
</li><li> For the most part, though, the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series averts this. Not a single character among the main cast is Japanese or of Japanese descent.

When Maryland-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda Softworks</a> acquired the franchise, they set <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> in Washington DC. You can even visit the company's ruined headquarters in the game. Though this may have been done deliberately to avoid having to follow the previous games' canon. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> remains in the East Coast, being set in Boston.
</li><li> Averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>. The developers just thought it would be cool to see a post-apocalyptic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a> 5</em>, developed in Japan, has a car list of over 1000, and about 150 of those are Nissans <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note77s15');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note77s15" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note77s15');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And 42 of those were <em>Skylines</em>!</span>. Most of the cars in the game hail from Japan.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza</a> Motorsport</em> series, developed in the United States, has a fairly even distribution between <em>modern</em> cars across the continents, but in classic cars, it's almost entirely classic muscle and high-end supercars from the 60s to the 80s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable content packages</a> after the release of <em>Forza Motorsport 4</em> have helped to balance out classic car distribution by adding in more classic Japanese and British cars.
<ul><li> <em>Forza Horizon</em> is set in Colorado, but the game's licensed soundtrack is utterly dominated by European artists (with many of them being relatively unheard of in the US) since the game was developed in the UK. <em>Horizon 2</em> is set in Southern Europe, so at least the European dominance is justified.
</li></ul></li><li> Something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> for the Massachusetts-based developers of the <em>iRacing</em> sim because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">cost and logistics</a> of shipping their laser scanning equipment around the world limited the opportunities to add non-American tracks until the sim became established and they could afford it.
</li><li> While not a Sim per se, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driveclub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Driveclub">Driveclub</a></em> was developed in the UK, and most of the cars featured are European: out of the ~100 cars, the only non-European cars were the Marussia B2 and Venom GT, and the oldest car from the list was the Ferrari 430 Scuderia, from <em>2007</em>. Thankfully the Season Pass balanced it giving 4 Chevrolets, 2 Dodges/SRTs, the Lykan Hypersport and some others. Also, cars from the previous century, such as the Lambo Diablo SV, Mclaren F1, and Ferrari F40/F50 were introduced. However, the 2 only Japanese things the game has are tracks and the console where it's played, but no cars.
</li><li> EA Canada, developers of EA's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHLHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NHLHockey">NHL</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer">FIFA</a></em> and early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a></em> games, has been showing some of this by overrating Vancouver's local teams and underrating their rivals, or the east coast teams in general. <em>FIFA 12</em> contained the first non-generic Major League Soccer stadium in the form of BC Place, home to the newly-joined Vancouver Whitecaps, which was still under renovation at the time of the game's release. As far back as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a> II</em>, the Canada level was very obviously based on Vancouver and the Coast Mountains and included the Sky Train and Expo Centre as prominent parts of the scenery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> starts with the Reaper invasion of Earth, in which Shepard was fighting them on Vancouver (a day's drive away from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a>'s headquarters). Though this would later be averted as when the game returns to Earth, the battlefield is instead on London.
<ul><li> Emily Wong's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterBlog">liveblog</a> of the Reaper invasion took place mostly in the greater Los Angeles area, which includes Electronic Arts' headquarters.
</li><li> Other places get a throwaway line in the background information - the first cities to fall to the reaper invasion were stated as Adelaide, Hamburg, Al Jubail, and Fort Worth. But that's about it.
</li><li> Lampshaded if Shepard romances Traynor. Shepard promises to take them to drinks in Vancouver after everything gets sorted out, but Traynor complains that it's not a more famous, romantic city like Paris or Venice. "You never take me anywhere nice."
</li></ul></li><li> Sweden-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a> has often given extra attention to Sweden and Scandinavia in their strategy games. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun">Victoria</a></em> all provide the player with the option to unify Scandinavia into a single nation. Paradox is particularly unrepentant with regards to this trope.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWAP0RNFOmc">Their release trailer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em>Europa Universalis IV</em> featured a mighty Swedish Empire.
</li><li> Of all the pagan faiths that existed in the timeframe of <em>Crusader Kings 2</em> but were effectively gone by that of <em>Europa Universalis IV</em>, one exists as a functional religion in the files of EUIV without having the Crusader Kings 2 Converter: Norse. It even gets a special feature in one of the expansions and can show up randomly if fantastical random New World is activated.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games made after the 4th generation will always have Japanese elements slip through, even if they're set in fantasy versions of the United States (<em>Black and White</em>, <em>Sun and Moon</em>) and France (<em>X and Y</em>). Abundant Shrine in the Unova region is obviously a Japanese shrine, for example, while the Lass trainer class usually wears an outfit based on Japanese school uniforms. Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, set in a UK analogue, gets a bit of this; despite the game's art director being British native James Turner, characters still do things like eat Japanese-style curry, instead of the Indian-style curry you're more likely to find in the United Kingdom.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s games always had a very odd relationship with this trope, despite Kojima being Japanese himself:
<ul><li> The setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Snatcher">Snatcher</a></em> is in the city of Neo-Kobe in Japan, except all the important characters are <em>Westerners</em> (plus a Chinese one) and the only Japanese guys you're going to find there are nameless extras.
</li><li> Played a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Policenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Policenauts">Policenauts</a></em>: While almost all the main characters are also Westerners, there's a few named Japanese ones, or with Japanese ancestry, and the main employer in the space colony when the game takes place is Japanese-owned.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series plays with this trope to ridiculous levels. Just like the aforementioned games, almost all the characters are technically Western too, but many of the characters, including the protagonist Solid Snake included, has some relation with Japan, even if that relation barely matters for the plot, other than helping the Japanese players to empathize with the already too Western cast of the series. The only characters with closer ties with Japan are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Kazuhira Miller</a> (even if he looks too American, being half-American himself)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8dvzx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8dvzx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8dvzx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">aside from him are easter egg characters modeled after the voice actors</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid">Teliko Friedman, Michiko Takiyama</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Johnny Sasaki</a> and Allen Ishiba, a Japanese-American soldier from a radio drama.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes</a></em> plays with this trope to hilarious levels: The only Japanese character you're going to find here is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> himself</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> plays this trope somewhat straight: The main character is an American-Liberian Ninja cyborg, one of the stages of the game takes place in a Japanese garden, one of the bad guys is a Japanese-Brazilian ninja as well and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the oddest case of this, Senator Armstrong use a Sumo wrestling pose before fighting against Raiden</span>. The odd part came with the fact it's heavily implied he somewhat <em>dislikes</em> Japanese culture.
</li><li> Plenty of Japanese elements sneak itself in the games when they wouldn't make sense in a Western setting. One of the most obvious is Volgin, a Marxist-Leninist, who is obsessed with Judo and repeats "kuwabara kuwabara", the latter has as much sense as a KKK member talking about Anansi the spider. In case that isn't enough to indicate what market this game is actually for, "kuwabara kuwabara" gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">zero explanation</a>, but there's a <em>looooong</em> explanation about the significance of the names ADAM and EVA.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>. Raiden's appearance is very culturally Japanese, with a Japanese name, samurai-influenced armour, ninja weaponry and martial arts, a stylised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> appearance, and a kabuki-themed breather on his water mask, but he's white, was born in Liberia, there's no evidence he's ever been to Japan, and he lives in New York. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a> "la-li-lu-le-lo" are themed around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseRanguage">Japanese Ranguage</a> pun that no-one other than weeaboos knows about in the West. Japanese text is used in the game's UI with zero explanation.
</li><li> Numerous parts of the games' philosophy comes off as very culturally Japanese, as well. The most obvious one is the obsession with nuclear weapons, which has a certain doom-laden tone that is generally inaccessible to any country that has not experienced a direct nuclear strike on a major civilian population centre. Various characters appear who appear to be American action heroes, but instead of extolling American movie virtues like individualism and being the best, instead state the Zen-ish virtue of simply doing whatever is required of you by the times, and tend to incorporate samurai-ish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a> elements. These elements also tend to crop up in throwaway details, like how any mention of drugs is condemnatory apart from Snake's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreGood">hilariously casual reliance on Benzedrine</a> (something that only makes sense in Japan's drug culture), and Laughing Octopus's backstory being based off an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope">untrue but commonly believed Japanese factoid about why Northern Europeans don't eat octopus</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders</a></em> series, as there's a single Japanese character, but just like the rest of the cast, nobody cares about from which country they came from; what <em>planet</em> they currently hail from is more important.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</a></em>, since the entire game takes place in Medieval Europe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding">Death Stranding</a></em> keeps with this as well, as the setting takes place in an apocalyptic version of the U.S. and the only character of Japanese origin could be The Engineer, which is based on the likeness of the mangaka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunjiIto">Junji Ito</a>.
</li><li> And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em> which is modeled after movie portrayals of the American Old West and almost entirely stars Caucasian and Native American characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AnalogueAHateStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AnalogueAHateStory">Analogue: A Hate Story</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HatePlus">Hate Plus</a></em> avoids this since, despite almost all the main characters being Korean, the author is a white Canadian girl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristineLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristineLove">Christine Love</a>. In fact, in <em>Analogue</em>, there's a section that shows the various works she used for research in order to avert this trope.
</li><li> In a similar way, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFriendsOfRingoIshikawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFriendsOfRingoIshikawa">The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa</a></em>, despite being set in Japan, and all the named characters are Japanese, was developed in Russia.
</li><li> A partial example: though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTropics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTropics">StarTropics</a></em> and its sequel were made by a Japanese team, it was only released in the United States, with the games heavily playing up that aspect. For example, the main character lives in Washington State, where Nintendo of America is located, and is a huge baseball fan.
</li><li> Wargaming gets the accusation that it intentionally makes vehicles from the Soviet Union overpowered in its games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em>. Who can say if it's true or not, but the attention the Soviet military gets can be a little excessive.
<ul><li> For example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> The Russian/Soviet Navy <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note992qj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note992qj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note992qj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Its earliest ships were laid down by imperial Russia</span> is a major player and got tech tree lines before Britain, France, Italy. All three nations were considered major naval powers (the British having the world's largest navy at the war's outset) while the Soviet Union's navy was a joke during the Second World War and really didn't do anything particularly interesting. Part of this was because the Russian company had much easier access to the blueprints of Russian ships (the British and especially Italian national archives are notoriously stingy about allowing access to military blueprints, even for ships that have been obsolete for over 60 years), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">the appeal of having their own nation's ships in the game</a> was also clearly a factor.
<ul><li> This gets muddled in regards to certain overpowered ships, which gave rise to the "Russian Bias" memes. The joke goes that if a ship is overpowered that belongs to another nation, it's because that ship abuses the game mechanics. If it's overpowered and Russian, then it's Russian Bias. "Balans, Comrade" and "The Almighty Spreadsheet" came about because Wargaming will use over/underperformance as reasons/excuses for buffs and nerfs (the most infamous being Kremlin getting it's AA nerfed... and pretty much nothing else, while the German lines have been powercrept into oblivion with nothing but a minor buff to even attempt to bring them back up to par).
</li></ul></li><li> And likewise for <em>World of Tanks</em> (developed in neighboring Belarus), there are far more Soviet tanks in the game than from any other nation. While it's certainly true that the Soviet Union designed and built a huge variety of tanks during the roughly 1930 to 1960 time period that <em>WoT</em> (mostly) covers, so did the United States and Britain, neither of which have anywhere near as many tanks represented in-game. This disparity is even more obvious when it comes to premium and reward tanks (26 American, 19 British, <strong>45 Russian</strong>, not counting clone premiums), not helped by the fact that several of the Russian premiums are actually British-made tanks that are currently exclusive to Russia rather than being available under the British flag.
</li></ul></li><li> A very odd version of this trope happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNinjaWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNinjaWarriors">The Ninja Warriors</a></em> games. The game takes place in a Western country, but both rebels and Balgar's army uses ninjas, albeit, in the rebels' case, they're robotic ones. It's never explained in the games why both sides use ninjas, along regular troop soldiers, other than the games were programmed in Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> concerns four primary parts of the world — the Middle East, a cathedral in France, a temple mound in Cambodia, and a mansion in Rhode Island. That said, its characters come from all walks of life, but the last playable one, Michael Edwards, is from Canada, the homeland of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SiliconKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SiliconKnights">Silicon Knights</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationFlashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationFlashpoint">Operation Flashpoint</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA">ARMA</a></em> series does this, in particular <em>ARMA II</em>, where the main setting of Chernarus includes Czech names for towns and characters who speak faux-Czech, and the third DLC for its expansion is "Army of the Czech Republic".
</li><li> Two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> games did this for the box art. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</a></em>'s original Japanese cover, as well as the cover for the PAL version, had the game's futuristic equivalent of the Russian Su-37, while the American release instead featured the American F-22. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> had the F-14 on all versions of the box art with two exceptions - the Spanish release replaced it with the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the French release with the Dassault Rafale.
<ul><li> A very odd version of this trope happens with two characters wielding Japanese names: Kei Nagase and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere">Rena Hirose</a>. With the sole exception of the light novel <em>Ace Combat: Ikaros in the Sky</em>, when she is properly Japanese, Nagase hails from the Strangereal version of the Western world and the same goes for Rena. The odd part of both girls came with the fact there's <em>no equivalent of Japan or even Asia</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10usbe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10usbe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10usbe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">By Asia, we mean the <em>the entire continent</em>, both the West and East parts of it. Keep in mind AC3 was originally self-contained and unrelated with the Strangereal universe and it was implied Rena hails from what it was formerly known as Japan, until the mega-corporations make the concept of nation completely obsolete, until it was retconned out later on.</span> Even more egregious, at least in Rena's case, her name is normally written in <em>kanji</em>, while Nagase's one is written in both katakana (the alphabet used for writing foreign names and words) and in the Western order, not to mention both girls, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Rena</a>, are treated in-universe as something special or weird.
</li><li> The plane roster is an aversion of this trope. Despite the series being made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment">a Japanese company</a>, most planes aren't Japanese. Throughout the entire franchise, there have been only three Japanese aircraft featured (discounting the one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizon">Assault Horizon</a></em> that was made by a fictional Japanese company), so good luck finding an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">A6M Zero</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">F-1 Kaizen or F-2 Viper Zero</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> for the Wii, Bear Hugger is portrayed as originally being from Salmon Arm, British Columbia (where Next Level Games is headquartered). He's actually from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> and its predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> are set in parallels to the United States (explicitly in the latter's case) and use dollars as currency, but since the games were made in Japan, items seem to be priced as if they were in yen. This results in things like a "Cheap" Bracelet costing $98. (Although a lot of items would be too <em>cheap</em> if this was the case since the yen's value has been less than one US cent for most of history, and peaked at about 1¼ cents the year <em>EarthBound</em> came out.)

</li><li> Being a Japanese game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ATrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ATrain">A-Train</a></em> mostly has Japanese trains. Even the worldwide version of <em>A-Train III</em> with European character faces, only labeled <em>A-Train</em>, has two fantasy trains, two American trains and 17 Japanese trains plus the computer-controlled Shinkansen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon">Transport Tycoon</a></em> looks <em>very</em> British. The buildings aren't exclusively British, but the overall style goes into that direction. Also, all rail vehicles except for the TGV are modeled after locomotives and railcars operating in Great Britain.
</li><li> Likewise, the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RollerCoasterTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RollerCoasterTycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a></em> games featured a few tip-offs as to their UK origin: Two of the three "real parks" offered in the expansion packs were in England (Alton Towers and Blackpool Pleasure Beach), and the third (Heide Park) is in Germany. There is also a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_skelter_(ride)">helter skelter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> included among the available rides (referred to as a "spiral slide"), something rarely seen in US parks. Then Infogrames neglected to localize the sequel for US audiences, leading to litter bins suddenly becoming rubbish bins, for example. Eventually a patch was released to remedy this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniMetro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniMetro">Mini Metro</a></em> has any number of real-world subways you can try to replicate, one of which is Auckland's. Except Auckland doesn't have a metro system, so why is it there, you may ask? Dinosaur Polo Club, the publisher and developer, is based there.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> is mainly set in what appears to be the US, Australia—or more accurately, a comical parody of it—would go on to get a lot of attention in the backstory: It's where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">wonder element</a> australium was discovered, and as a result has become a center of insanely advanced technology despite being, as Elizabeth put it, "a nation of idiots". Then there was the Australian Christmas Update, which centered around the legend of Old Nick, basically an evil Australian Santa Claus. Why the obsession with Australia? Most likely because Team Fortress's creator Robin Walker lived there before he got a job at Valve.
</li><li> The Chilean-based ACE Team made more than a few games involving Chile. The eponymous Abyss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AbyssOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AbyssOdyssey">Abyss Odyssey</a></em> is right underneath the city Ace Team is based off of, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZenoClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZenoClash">Zeno Clash</a></em> it's revealed in the second game that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the entire land of Zenozoik that the games take place is in is actually a quarantined Chile far, <em>far</em> into the future</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AngelsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AngelsOfDeath">Angels of Death</a></em> (both the game and the animated adaptation) was made in Japan by a Japanese creator, but the story takes place in a English-speaking country and none of the characters are Japanese.
</li><li> In a similar way, the whole <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> series takes place in the U.S., with no Japanese characters whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelsAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelsAvengers">Marvel's Avengers</a></em> sees the team relocate to San Francisco, which serves as the primary setting of the game, as opposed to the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMunchies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMunchies">Dungeon Munchies</a></em> has an English title, and the option for English texts and subtitles, the Taiwanese devs mostly communicate in Traditional Chinese on the forums, using the same language for the untranslated signs all over the game's world. Additionally, the architecture is similar to that of most urban East Asian cities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition">Deadly Premonition</a></em> is openly inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>, and as such is set in a tiny town in northwest America and stars American characters. Some instances of Japanese culture comes through in the way characters interact with each other, but the game is so surreal, it's hard to notice. One example does shine through though - early on, the characters have to solve a puzzle involving Chess pieces, one that would be simple for an average American adult, but each character is stumped and need someone else to explain Chess to them. On top of that, the room the puzzle is in is adorned with posters labeling each Chess piece and you can interact with them to get a better look. These caveats are more for Japanese players who would be completely unfamiliar with the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FoodFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FoodFantasy">Food Fantasy</a></em> is supposed to showcase different foods from around the world, but it should come as no surprise that about half of its various Food Souls are Chinese or Japanese because the game originates from China.

<ul><li> Google Translate:
<ul><li> It used to translate 华裔女孩 as "Chinese-American girl", when it simply means a girl of Chinese descent who is not a Chinese citizen, without <em>any</em> reference to the US. It has now been changed, however. It should be noted that Google Translate uses automated algorithms that compare different translations of websites instead of the translations being defined by hand, which can result in errors like this. This is the Google bots picking up on a Chinese bias rather than an American one. The Chinese word for "American" is frequently used to mean all foreigners in general (including south and south-east Asians), and "America" is essentially synonymous with "waiguo".
</li><li> Google Translate also appears to sporadically convert things like place names, names of bands or artists and other terms that are rarely used outside of the language from their area from the original text into ones local to the language it's translating to, rather than maintaining the one that makes more sense in the original context. Phrases like "Raggende manne komt naar de Efteling" are translated to "Sabaton is coming to the Big Ben." (Although sometimes the words remain untranslated when used in a slightly different sentence.)
</li></ul></li><li> At times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> itself. Uses of phrases like "our part of the world" and so on, especially when used to contrast with other cultures and nations, reveal the assumptions of the troper responsible. Usually involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">we all live in the US</a> or other progressive/liberal Western perspective and neglects if not outright disparages as backward or worse the existence of conservative or libertarian-minded non-Western audiences or tropers who may disagree with certain presumptions like sociocultural values.

Works that are released in neither region, if they get their own pages, will probably just receive maintenance from one or two editors.

In 26 episodes, aired between 1979 and 1981, the show covers world history from the birth of planet Earth and the evolution of life up to the 1970s. While fairly accurate and attempting to be objective, the show covers important events and eras as seen from a Western perspective. Most of the action takes place in Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. Figures like Pericles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheProphetMuhammad">The Prophet Muhammad</a>, Charlemagne and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter I of Russia</a> get entire episodes devoted to them. But the cultures of the rest of Asia, Africa, and pre-Colombian America are hardly represented. For example, out of the entire history of China, only Kublai Khan gets the spotlight treatment and then only through his interactions with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcoPolo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcoPolo">Marco Polo</a>. The creators tried to make up for this by making a sequel entitled <em>Once Upon a Time... in America</em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">focused on the history of the Americas</a>, including pre-Colombian times.
</li><li> Of course, American kid shows with a world history theme tend to be guilty of the same thing: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Histeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Histeria">Histeria!</a></em> did two episodes each on the American Revolution and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> (in addition to dealing with these events in other episodes as well), while in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em>, every other location and period the squad visited was in the U.S. after 1776.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> cartoon pilot. Of all the places on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsignificantLittleBluePlanet">Insignificant Little Blue Planet</a> where T. Bird could find three dudes to turn into Battletoads, he had to pick Oxnard, California.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The government isn't just <em>like</em> the U.S. government, it <em>is</em> the U.S. government. The flag of the World resembles the American one, the Earth's president lives in the White House and the people are called "Earthicans." Also, there are only two significant political parties to vote into office, both of them American.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> first runs for President of Earth, someone objects that the Earthican Constitution states that nobody can be President more than twice. Apparently being President of the US counts as being President of the Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show has been known to be guilty of treating Springfield as if it is in California, since that is where the writers live, and according to the DVD commentaries they are aware that this trope has been in effect. Most notable is the weather - Springfield is often shown as bright and sunny year-round (the exception being Christmas when it is usually portrayed as permanently snow-covered for thematic reasons). This being <em>The Simpsons</em>, it has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa</strong>: It was an unseasonably warm February 14th, so the children walked home without jackets.
</div></li><li> The couch gag of "Them, Robot" shows The Simpsons hanging up a poster in 1989 with the text: "America, the most powerful country in the world". Then the years pass by and in 2012 (the year of broadcast) they pull the old text down to replace it with a new one: "America, too big to fail (we hope)". This is clearly aimed as a spark of hope to the American viewers in light of people suffering under the economic crisis, which nevertheless is a universal problem, not just of America alone. Furthermore, even though the creators try to put in a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryTisOfTheeThatISting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryTisOfTheeThatISting">My Country Tis of Thee That I Sting</a> humor it still comes across as if the rest of the world should solely pity the poor Americans, while other countries like Greece or Iceland were hit far more seriously by the economic crisis than the USA.
</li><li> In 2014 Scottish people were allowed to vote whether they wanted Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom or become independent. The makers of <em>The Simpsons</em> made a short promo starring their Scottish character Groundskeeper Willie vocally explaining why Scotland <em>should</em> become independent. Many people in Scotland weren't amused, because the Americans who made it seemed to think that every country ruled by the British naturally wants to become independent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">just like the USA did in 1776</a>. This would be like a Scot making a video advocating the independence of the People's Republic of New Jersey, The Holy State of Utah, or New England.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> is set in (and named after a region of) Colorado, as creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> were raised there and met at the University of Colorado. Cartman has also been borrowed by the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpmTOVJPP-Y">Denver Nuggets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (and in a case of headquarters instead of hometown provincialism, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPmdtd_Shw">Los Angeles Kings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
<ul><li> Additionally, Parker was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic">Raised Catholic</a> and thus every non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Jewish</a> person in town practices that particular branch of Christianity, despite the fact that in Colorado Protestants outnumber Catholics 2:1.
</li><li> Although neither Trey Parker nor Matt Stone was raised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormon</a>, they include a lot of stuff about Mormons in their works, as Colorado's right next to Utah. Thus, they knew a lot of them growing up.
</li></ul></li><li> In a bit of a twist, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> cartoon takes place in "Terlawk", a spin on creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougTenNapel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougTenNapel">Doug TenNapel</a>'s hometown of Turlock, California. One episode even has a joke attempting an explanation why there's so many alien attacks (an old guy put graffiti on a deep space probe daring aliens to destroy the town). (The fictional Terlawk is said to be in New Jersey, however.)
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> loves to throw in some obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">Big Applesauce</a> for good measure (Chrysler Building, Twin Towers, mentioning the Statue of Liberty without mentioning its hometown), it also slips in a lot from Los Angeles in general and Hollywood and Burbank in particular where it was made. The police wear LAPD uniforms and drive LAPD-colored cars, the pilot "To the Rescue" features the L.A. city hall as well as Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Seymour's Travel Agency in "It's a Bird, It's Insane, It's Dale!" is located near Lankershim Boulevard and Cahuenga Boulevard which meet in Studio City, and "The Luck Stops Here" mentions Flower Street (they're mentioned again in "A Wolf in Cheap Clothing"), one of which stretches from Hollywood to Burbank. Perhaps this is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Tad Stones</a> meant with the "West Coast city with an East Coast flair".
</li><li> A minor case from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em>— the design of the Hall of Justice was based off <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Union_Terminal">Union Terminal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an art-deco train station inc Cincinnati, Ohio. At the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> was owned by the Cincy-based Taft Broadcasting. (Bringing it full-circle, footage of the real Union Terminal was used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a> adaptation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invasion">Invasion!</a></em> crossover event, as a disused STAR Labs facility intentionally invoking the Hall of Justice.)

<ul><li> A lot of songs that have become "classics" in a certain language are often just translated covers. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyWay">My Way</a>" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, for instance, is not American in origin, but a cover of "Comme d'Habitude" by French singer Claude François. Several traditional children's songs also exist in French, German, English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian versions and it's often difficult to trace which one was the original.
</li><li> A London newspaper made a ranking of "most appropriate cities to be the world's capital" (without explaining why). Guess which was number one.
</li><li> Wondering why so many Chinese restaurants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CuisinesInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CuisinesInAmerica">in the US</a> claim to cook Hunan-style? When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> went to China, he was greeted with a lavish banquet. Whenever he found a dish he particularly enjoyed, he'd ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Chairman Mao</a> where it came from (seeking to avert this trope and demonstrate his knowledge of and respect for the diversity of Chinese culture — "I know you're a big country with lots of different cuisines, just like us!"). Mao, having grown up in Hunan Province, would always say it was from the Hunan area. Nixon came back singing the praises of Hunan-style cuisine.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/4xO8PhBYREc?t=13m5s">One of New TV Lebanon's old news intros<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had a globe that depicted Africa, Eurasia, and the Pacific, <em>but not the Americas</em>.
</li><li> Computer programs like Microsoft Word often have the default language setting as American English, which is frustrating for any other English speakers, who want spell check to stop telling them they spelled "colour" wrong. Even applies to some online British/Australian etc job application forms that will highlight non-American spelling (obvious typos like 'color' being one of the first ways hiring managers will thin the pile of applications.)
</li><li> Some tech or web companies from California's Bay Area or Silicon Valley show preference in their home region.
<ul><li> Guess what is Yelp's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">default city</a>.
</li><li> For a while, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>'s spell check did not recognize the word "cooperation" (recognizing it only in its hyphenated state, "co-operation") and replace it with the word "Cupertino." Cupertino is a small town in California near Silicon Valley where Apple is located that, were it not for this quirk of that spell check, would be mostly unknown to anyone else and would otherwise be unlikely to be part of a spell check's word list. They've since run with it. Check the time settings on an iPhone, most modern Apple devices have Cupertino as the city listed for PST. Not San Francisco, not Los Angeles, not Seattle or Portland or even San Jose (the nearest big city to Cupertion) —Cupertino.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, many Japanese websites list the 47 prefectures of Japan first when asking for members' locations. "Overseas" is almost always listed last, and hardly ever allows you to specify where. However, Japanese websites that have gained more international members (and have been translated into other languages), such as Pixiv and Nico Nico Douga, have started to avert this, allowing members to specify which country they're from.
</li><li> Many webshops demand you enter a ZIP Code, even when you select a country other than the USA. This despite the fact that the ZIP Code is meaningless outside the US.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmAtEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmAtEleven">Film at 11</a> trope doesn't account for the fact that in the Central and Mountain Time Zones the late local newscast has always been at 10:00 pm. Plus, in all time zones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> affiliates have their late local news one hour earlier than the other networks (though of course, the trope pre-dated the creation of FOX by several decades).
</li><li> In a sense, this happens repeatedly in humanity's understanding of the universe. At first, people thought Earth was the largest thing in the universe and everything else had to be the little specks seen in the sky (or the big specks known as the Sun and the Moon). Then, people accepted that the Earth is not of any special importance to the Solar System but still thought the Solar System encompassed the known universe with the stars being a speckled backdrop beyond the furthest planets. Then, the Milky Way was discovered to be a vast collection of stars comparable to our Sun, half of whom have planetary systems like ours, but the Milky Way was then thought to be the extent of the universe. Then, the Andromeda Galaxy was discovered to be a galaxy similar to the Milky Way and we expanded our scope of the universe to an unimaginably large collection of such galaxies. Now there's reason to believe that the universe we live in might not be the only one to exist.
</li><li> The standard barcode with 13 digits used world-wide is the EAN: European Article Number. The 12-digit number only used in North America is the UPC: Universal Product Code. Go figure.
</li><li> Films made by Americans about World War II tend to either entirely diminish or not even mention Canada's contributions to the war (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo">Argo</a></em>) or are rewritten entirely to replace Canadians with Americans (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571">U-571</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gold">Gold</a></em>).
</li><li> Thanks to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content">"Canadian content" laws<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, listening to an oldies radio station in Canada is a surreal experience, especially for non-Canadians. Because 35-40% of the songs have to be by Canadian artists, you'll hear a couple of familiar hits, then a song you've never heard before by a Canadian, then back to the familiar hits. And Canadian artists who managed to become successful internationally are overrepresented. If you knew nothing about 1970s pop music and listened to a Canadian oldies station, you'd end up with the impression that Anne Murray, The Guess Who, and Gordon Lightfoot were major superstars. The same rules occasionally have spillover effects: for instance, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, at least one of the major alternative-rock stations in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a> radio market was actually based in Windsor, across the Canadian border; the effect was (1) there was a <em>lot</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a> played on that station, to the point that people got sick of it, and (2) a not insubstantial number of Michiganders have not only heard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTragicallyHip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTragicallyHip">The Tragically Hip</a>, but actually like them (unlike most of the US). The same is true of other genres — just listen to a Canadian country station, and you'll hear mainstream country music blended in with names like Tim Hicks, Dean Brody, Lindsay Ell, and Dallas Smith, none of whom have made much noise in the States if at all.
<ul><li> The same laws forced game shows taped in Canada for American TV (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SuperPayCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SuperPayCards">Super Pay Cards</a></em>) to have Canadian personalities on-camera in additional segments and the like. This posed a problem for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork">USA Network</a>'s revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChainReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChainReaction">Chain Reaction</a></em>, which taped in Montreal. When original Canadian-born host Blake Emmons left after the first few weeks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Starcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Starcade">Geoff Edwards</a> was brought in to replace him. But this meant they were breaking CanCon laws in the process, as Edwards was an American. The solution was to have announcer Rod Charlebois appear on-screen every episode, playing a minigame of sorts with Geoff.
</li><li> CanCon also bedeviled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MuchMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a> when that network launched an American feed in 1994. People complained about the network's Canadian origins and focusing on Canadian artists nobody south of the border really cared about. This led to the network splitting off as MMUSA in 2001 and a full rebrand as Fuse in 2003.
</li></ul></li><li> A great deal of reporting on "Canadian culture" tends to operate on the assumption that readers are primarily interested in how Canada is different than the United States. This might be true for Americans and Canadians, but often less than helpful for the rest of the world. For example, a list of "Canadian foods" will inevitably feature a lot of relatively obscure snack foods that can't be bought in the United States, such as ketchup-flavored potato chips, but never mention common Canadian things like smores or root beer that Americans would take for granted as normal, but people outside North America might find curious or distinctive.
</li><li> The phrase "God's own country" has been used by Americans, Australians, New Zealandians, Scots, Irish people, Indian people, but always for their own nation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a> intentionally used this idea to write their song "In God's Country", which is officially about America, but has lyrics vague enough that fans from every country in the world see it as referring to their country.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> event has always vastly favored English-language films, to the point that it typically relegates all other films to compete against each other for the Best Foreign Language Film award. Most other categories are largely filled out by English-language films, particularly the acting categories. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/THere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/THere">T Here</a> have obviously been exceptions, with some foreign directors receiving Lifetime Achievement honors and some foreign films receiving multiple awards, though it wasn't until 2019 that a foreign language film won Best Picture: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019">Parasite 2019</a></em>. The <em>In Memorium</em> section is also more global with its honors.
</li><li> Local TV news stations in the USA often focus their local news segments on the city in which the station is located, usually because it is the most "downtown" area in its market. Areas on the outskirts are often ignored unless there is major news.
</li><li> "But enough about you, here's New Jersey" is a running joke among the residents of New York City as city news outlet (particularly traffic and weather) often dedicate as much time to discussing the neighboring state of New Jersey as they do discussing things locally. Partially this has to do with the fact many commuters live in the New Jersey but also the fact that space for large operations like news broadcasters is more available there (only a few, very successful and established outlets can afford to operate out of NYC). This is mirrored somewhat with New Jersey's southern counties and Philadelphia; South Jersey does get decent coverage by Philadelphia media, although because Philly is smaller and less expensive than NYC, the outlets are more likely based in the city itself. Where New Jersey gets the shaft media-wise is Central Jersey, which unfortunately for all involved is where the state's capital of Trenton sits. Neither Philadelphia nor New York outlets seem to have much interest in reporting the goings-on in N.J. government, as it is literally on the border between their two respective spheres of influence: it sits on the other side of the river from Pennsylvania, and Mercer County (where Trenton is) is part of the New York metropolitan area for statistical purposes (based on economic connections) but is part of the Philadelphia media market. Because Trenton is so peripheral, it doesn't get much media coverage, which feeds into the ability of New Jersey politicians to engage in the shady dealings for which they are so famous.
</li><li> A prime cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLongitudeProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLongitudeProblem">The Longitude Problem</a> was that, for centuries, national politics prevented people of different countries from agreeing on a global Prime Meridian, with several nations using a point in their own capital cities as zero degrees longitude. The pressures of international commerce finally forced most nations to agree on a Prime Meridian through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">later tweaked</a> a few arcseconds east of the observatory by the IERS.
</li><li> A much nastier version of this happened with computer technology: Since computers and computing are western inventions, and were originally intended for western use exclusively, it was natural that the first computers were able to display Latin text exclusively. This became a royal pain for people with different writing systems, such as Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and, very especially, people from countries which write from right-to-left, like Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, etc. Special mention for East Asian users, especially Japan, which they were forced to create their own computers that could handle their writing systems correctly, something that neither MS-DOS nor Windows could do until the 90s. It wasn't until the Windows 7 era, however, that most OSs now can handle those writing systems natively, regardless the region the user is located and without the need of a special OS for those regions.
</li><li> American dates (Month, Day, Year) can cause double takes on ticketing apps and the like to non-American users left worrying if they've just forked out large sums of money for the wrong date.
