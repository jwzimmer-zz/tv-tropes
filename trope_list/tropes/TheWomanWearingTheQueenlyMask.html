</p><p>An important part of this character is that she isn't in a trusting and happy relationship (platonic or otherwise) as this would make her burden less heavy for her and thus remove much of the conflict inherent in this archetype.

However, this became more evident when the Band of the Hawk got into some deep shit after their charismatic leader, Griffith, got arrested and imprisoned after Guts, a man who got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">both of their affection</a> (one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">a bit more extreme</a>, which led to his erratic behavior in the first place), left the Hawks, which left Casca in charge. Casca became so physically and emotionally drained during this time, not only because two men that she respected and loved were not by her side, but because she was in charge with keeping the Band of the Hawk together AND alive (since they became fugitives upon Griffith's arrest). She was able to keep her cool for the most part... but when Guts comes back after a year, Casca just lets it all spill out, and almost attempted suicide.

He had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> for quite some time, and when he drops <em>that</em> act, he puts on another mask, this time using as an example a legendary hero he admires, whenever he has to do something connected to his title and responsibility. He tells a friend that he has no idea who he himself actually is, after wearing masks for so long.
</li><li> In the first book of Tad William's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shadowmarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shadowmarch">Shadowmarch</a></em>, Briony has to rule at age fifteen and though she has a hard time, her brother is completely hopeless.
</li><li> In Megan Whalen Turner's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief">The Queen's Thief</a></em>, the Queen of Attolia inspires awe and fear in her people, and she certainly isn't <em>nice</em> but her job isn't easy either. Specifically, she was forced to marry a much older man who completely disregarded her, most tellingly eating her food and drinking from her glass without asking permission. So she poisoned her own wine.
<ul><li> It doesn't get any easier when our good friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eugenides</span> wins her love and becomes King of Attolia. He's happy as a clam to be married to the woman he fell in love with so long ago, but he isn't so hot on the job that comes with it. Now, not only does the poor woman have to rule the country, she has to keep reminding her husband that now it's <em>his</em> country too, and he needs to take an interest in ruling it.
</li></ul></li><li> Historical/literary example: Pearl Buck's interpretation of Tsu Hsi (Ci-xi) in the historical novel <em>Imperial Woman</em>. In real life, it's still debated if Cixi truly as much of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a> as usually depicted or if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina">Red China</a> and its propaganda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">made her worse than she really was.</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi#Historical_opinions">Considering other testimonies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Cixi was a polemic and very shady figure, but not the uber-horrid monster that she's portrayed to be.
</li><li> Another example discussing Ci Xi is Anchee Min's books <em>Empress Orchid</em> and <em>The Last Empress,</em> which portray her as more harassed, tired, and maligned than anything else.

Part of the problem, though, is that these are the same Heralds she must often send into deadly danger.
<ul><li> Naturally, the one time she fails to ask her Heralds for advice (and they fail to speak their minds), she makes a disastrous marriage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that nearly gets her killed</span>.

</li><li> President Eloise Pritchart of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">restored</span> Republic of Haven, as well — she's not, strictly speaking, a queen, but she <em>is</em> a President with the same responsibilities. And all the more so because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she, Thomas Theisman, her lover Javier Giscard, and a few other people had restored a true republic that hadn't existed for two centuries</span>, and so she absolutely <em>must</em> be this in order to ensure it survives.

This event leaves her mentally challenged son as the official king, and she has to act through him to lead her kingdom through some very serious conflicts, with only a handful of advisors remaining loyal to her.
</li><li> Queen Ketricken from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TawnyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TawnyMan">Tawny Man Trilogy</a></em> is this. She has lost her husband, all family and friends, and has had to clean up a kingdom after a war. She also has to deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">persecution</a> of certain of her people by others of her people. Although she wears plain clothing and little jewellery in public, she still only lets her guard down in private.

She sent out explorers, listened to their reports when they returned, and all the while she wanted to <strong>be</strong> an explorer, not just hear what they had to say.
<div class="indent">And if she were not Hatshepsut the pharaoh, she might blurt out, simply, with tears: <em>I want to go</em>, the way she had ached when her explorers had come back to her and told of great waterfalls and strange tribes and unknown coasts and vast seas. <em>I want to go</em> because she had ruled two-thirds of the known world and had no freedom ever to see those things, she could only send others...

However, she does not have to worry about doubts of a woman ruler, as Belleza (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> version of Venice) would not accept anything <em>but</em> a female ruler. And furthermore, she takes this role to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bitch</a> levels.

Her problems are not caused by her sex or youth, but by her not actually being a queen yet. She has to deal with a civil war caused by other aspiring queens, not to mention some highly irritating magic wielders and being pregnant to a man whom (and whose children) dozens of people would love to kill. Oh, and did I mention approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">End of the World as We Know It</a> yet?
<ul><li> Egwene al'Vere kind of fits this, too. Or at least she used to. Sure, she's no queen, she's "just" the leader of the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Witch Species</a> who put her on the Amyrlin Seat as a puppet and nothing more.

Chosen as an Ol-zhaan at thirteen (the usual age) her psychic gifts and personal charm were such that she was made High Priestess only two or three years later. Like all Ol-zhaan she could have "close communion" love affairs but was forbidden to pair-bond (marry) or have children. She had to keep up the serene and regal mask of the High Priestess for the Kindar people, and even her fellow Ol-zhaan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She also has to keep up a mask of ruthlessness as Grandmistress of the Geets-Kel</span>. Yet, all those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">acts she had to take</a> in her long life now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">began to weigh on her conscience</a> and ended up injuring Green-sky in the long term, to say nothing of what it did to her psychic powers. Her Choosing Raamo, guided in part by a prophetic dream she'd had, was a way to try and repair some of the damage done.
</li><li> Shakuntala in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries">Belisarius Series</a></em> is locked in a guerrilla campaign against one of the most powerful empires of the sixth century AD with few allies due to other kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent not wanting to draw the rapacious attention of said empire.

</li><li> Orual from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TillWeHaveFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TillWeHaveFaces">Till We Have Faces</a>,</em> as the page quote notes. In this case, she <em>literally</em> wore a mask/veil as well.
</li><li> Nasuada from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> isn't a queen, but she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">the leader of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">The Alliance</a> and theoretically equal to her royal supporters. She has workaholic tendencies and once noted that she cannot indulge in romance, though she has considered proposing a diplomatic marriage to one of her allies. Murtagh has a one-sided crush on her, which will probably turn out to be important in the last book of the series.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns into a more literal example at the end of <em>Inheritance</em>, when Nasuada is declared Queen. Good call on the Murtagh thing, which also enhances this by not allowing the two to be together.</span>

Kristin then agreed to take the throne, but that of course meant she could no longer marry Mark or be his lover. After that, she had to be totally formal with Mark and hide her true feelings. The mask slipped once or twice, as when her uncle, the wizard Karel, was reluctant to leave them alone together, and Kristin angrily pointed out that it was <em>way</em> too late to be worried about that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It all worked out in the end when Mark was revealed to be the son of the Emperor, and as such an appropriate consort for the princess after all.</span>
<ul><li> Subverted with Yambu, the Silver Queen, in the same series. After she became queen, she became detached and distant, and could never let her true feelings show; but at the same time was also pretty informal, and took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">any man whom she pleased</a> as a lover, although she never had any feelings for them, of course. She's also a subversion in the sense that her emotional detachment is necessary for her to commit the crimes she proceeds to carry out in power, including selling her own daughter into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">slavery</a>.

Unfortunately for her, along with power it also confers mental instability and delusions of grandeur that has isolated her from both her family and people, not to mention the hard decisions she has had to make to keep her country from full-scale civil war. The game actually plays with this early on, trailers and her actions at the beginning of the game portraying her as a merciless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Tyrant</a>, totally at odds with her real character. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nzo3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nzo3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nzo3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Arshtat was not always this trope; she became queen during a time when the country was on the verge of civil war.

Those years were probably the happiest of her life. However, things started to go downhill about two years before the start of the game, when events forced her to bear the Sun Rune. That's when she became this trope. Her sheer force of personality, along with her husband's, had been keeping the country stable for that entire time. But with the run pushing her closer to the edge, both of them know that it's only a matter of time before she goes completely insane, and/or the political groups make a grab for power (restarting the civil war). </span>

She may have worn the mask during the early years of her reign and after she became amnesiac, but for most of the time she spent ruling her kingdom, she was neither as isolated (having enjoyed a thousand years of ongoing stellar popularity) nor her rule as fragile as the other examples: being the most experienced and cunning ruler -she will know with a quick glance who among her bureaucrat and officers will betray her, <em>decades before</em> they start to contemplate treason, will let them rise in rank for as long as they are useful to her kingdom and single-handedly out-gambit them when they finally turn against her- as well as one of the three most powerful mages on the planet makes things like strictly adhering to the protocol, hiding her emotions, carefully choosing her consort, etc... superfluous considering how unshakable her throne is.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessesRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessesRule">Princess Bubblegum</a> has been doing this for more than 800 years and counting, but it's more a part of her personality than a mask. Season 5.2 made it especially clear that she's having a breakdown caused by all the stress she's under throughout the series. She fears dying because it would leave the Candy populace unattended and she has few confidants, namely Lady Rainicorn and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> Finn. The latter is complicated given how he had feelings for her for the longest time and how her own tendencies means she can be suspect in how much she cares about him (though it does become clear she genuinely treasures their bond and cares for him as a friend.) She is somewhat unrespected (though that's namely because of her surveillance and her subjects come to appreciate her more when they realize living under the so-called King of Ooo is pretty bad).
<ul><li> It's telling that when she was temporary restored to her 13-year-old self, she did not want to take back the reigns of her 18-year-old self. She preferred to indulge in youthful merriment, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">spending alot of close time with Finn.</a> She was also more jovial and light-hearted. She only re-aged herself back up since her successor Lemongrab was running the Candy Kingdom to the ground and even then, she was reluctant to.
</li></ul></li><li> Princess Yue from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> realised that she must do what is best for the Northern Water Tribe, even though it meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">marrying a man she didn't love</a>. In the end, she was willing to take this as far as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to resurrect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">the Moon Spirit</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Celestia may technically be one of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Empresses of Ponykind</a>, but she hates her duties and the court protocol so much, she enacted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to manipulate the mane characters into <em>destroying half her palace</em> as an excuse to get out of having to deal with a formal soiree, so she could just hang out with said characters at the local donut shop instead without breach of protocol. It's hinted that her centuries of isolation without Luna was a big reason why.
</li><li> At the beginning of "Sweet and Elite", Rarity is given a room in the palace while staying in Canterlot and goes overboard with the praise, going so far as to <em>kiss Celestia's hooves</em>. The princess is visibly uncomfortable the entire time.
</li><li> In "Princess Twilight - Part 1", Celestia explains to Twilight that she's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">enduring</a> the Summer Sun Celebrations for the sake of her subjects, even though it's served her only as a bitter reminder of her needing to banish her sister. However, she is much happier and looking forward to the one in this season, since it now serves as a celebration of her and Luna reuniting.
</li><li> Luna too displays some of this. Though she gets upset when her subjects display fear towards her, she is clearly more comfortable as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">distant, imperious monarch</a> as a means of hiding her more vulnerable nature.
</li><li> After Twilight Sparkle becomes a princess, she notably averts this, acting the same as she did before ascending. She even tells her friends not to refer to her as "Princess Twilight."
</li></ul></li><li> The driving antagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> are led by a trio (formerly a quartet) of royalty-caste beings called the Diamonds, who led a highly invasive multi-galactic empire. As the show develops these antagonists, variations on this trope come into play:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Yellow Diamond</a> could be seen as touching on this trope  she <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtA-juh3rf4">has a song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> trying to convince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">Blue Diamond</a> to get over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Pink Diamond</a>'s death</span>, but by the end it's pretty clear that she's close to tears herself. (Blue Diamond may also count, but it's not clear if she's even <em>trying</em> to hide her depression.)
<div class="indent"><em>"Don't you know I miss her too?!</em> <br/><em>But tell me...</em> <br/><em>What's the use of feeling..."</em>
</div></li><li> We later find out that Pink Diamond zigzagged this. While the Diamond Authority was a rule of four equals on the outside, Pink, being the youngest, was often brushed aside <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as incompetent, and had begged for her own colony because her authority was essentially a farce put on for their subjects. But when she got the colony she asked for, she realized to her horror that completing colonization would kill the life that lived there  a truth she'd been unaware of, as she'd believed that Gem production "created life from nothing"; she later miserably concludes that they are instead "stealing life and leaving nothing behind."</span> When Pink made the decision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Ruler of Earth to spare the Earth from the resource extraction process that would destroy it, Yellow and Blue wrote her off as irresponsible and ungrateful, usurped control, and made her only task to smile and assure her subjects that the Rebellion that had cropped up against Gem Homeworld rule was no threat. Unbeknownst to them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Pink had created the Rebellion herself</a>; her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetQueen">Puppet Queen</a> role was a part she played in the hopes that her careful balancing act would last until her rebels could free the colonized planet; she even spread Anti-Pink propaganda to incite them further.</span> All the while the Diamond Authority continued putting on a front of being a single, cohesive, flawless oligarchy in order to hold their empire together.
</li><li> Ironically, the rebel leader Rose Quartz <em>becomes</em> this. Initially Rose's purpose was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for Pink to be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">socialize with others and experience freedom from the restraints of her class</a></span>, but since her decision to spearhead a Rebellion, she had to become whatever necessary for her fellow rebels to believe in her competency in leadership and maintain unity in the cause. She had a lot of personal baggage that probably would have torn the Rebellion apart if her secrets had been known and led to the doom of the Earth and the rebels, so she hid her flaws under a graceful, perfect, wise, infallible veneer in order to keep the Rebellion together. Which ironically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though not uncoincidentally</span>, reflects many traits in the façade propagated by the Diamond Authority about their own leadership.

<div class="indent"> "...I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field...." (Elizabeth to the troops at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_to_the_Troops_at_Tilbury">Tilbury<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the Spanish Armada approached.)
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a> wore quite literally a Queenly mask, painting her face white and bedecking herself with jewels as she got older, to emphasise the cult of youthful virginity that grew around her.
</li><li> Elizabeth II, as mentioned in the entry about the film <em>The Queen</em> above, has quite a bit of this trope in her story, too.
</li></ul></li><li> Urraca, Queen of Leon and Castile from 1109 AD to 1126 AD. She was Queen in her own right and reigned alone from 1110 onwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> of Austria fits this trope perfectly — she had great difficulty in establishing the claim of her husband, Francis of Habsburg-Lorraine, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a>; she was betrayed and made war on by her nominal subject Frederick II of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>; and though she was devoted to her husband, his philandering made her bitterly unhappy; and her son <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephII">Joseph II</a>'s progressive policies troubled her deeply. She was also a major Badass. She once gave birth then rushed off, to command her troops in battle with the baby in her arm (though admittedly she lost that battle).
</li><li> Queen Isabel of Castile (Isabella, of "Isabella and Ferdinand" fame), who, besides sending Columbus to the New World, often led troops while pregnant, in course of the Reconquista. Fittingly, she was one of Maria Theresa's ancestors.
<ul><li> Her daughter, Catherine of Aragon, proved that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a>. Her first marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, ended abruptly with her young husband's death, leaving her in a dangerous political position. Her marriage to Arthur's younger brother Henry VIII fixed that problem, and for several years they were actually quite happy together; she often ran England while he was away fighting the French, even defeating the Scottish troops in a battle she personally directed. After Henry threw her over for Anne Boleyn, however, she took on the Queenly Mask rather than let her detractors see how much she was suffering, and continued to insist that she was the rightful Queen Consort. Even though she was kept apart from her only living child and eventually developed a cancer that would kill her, she remained loyal to Henry and to England until her last breath.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> <em>had</em> to be this at the beginning of her reign, because her claim for the Russian throne was dubious at best - she wasn't Romanov or even Russian at all, leading many to basically ask, "Seriously, what the hell?" But when her position was somewhat stronger, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">relaxed a bit</a>.
</li><li> Empress Elisabeth of Austria (<em>Sissi</em>) has to fall into this category. She was shy and introverted by nature, and excruciatingly ill at ease among the stifling formality of Hapsburg court life after she married Emperor Franz Joseph. However, she was viewed as a fairy tale princess and beloved by the common people of Austria and Hungary.
</li><li> Hawaii's last queen, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Liliuokalani">Queen Liliuokalani<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Her husband cheated on her <em>numerous</em> times... and she had the misfortune of reigning just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a> was taking over Hawaii.
</li><li> The Celtic queen Boudicea. Her husband was killed, she was beaten, and her two daughters were raped by Roman invaders. She did not choose to take that sitting down and declared war on them. She was ultimately defeated but did so much damage that <em>to this day</em> excavators in London still find what's been deemed the "Boudicca's Destruction Horizon" so she certainly didn't go down without a fight.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0s8nu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0s8nu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0s8nu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's less heroic than that in reality. The Romans were the underdog in the war against her, not the other way around. Boudica was defeated even though she held massive numerical advantage over the Romans. The Roman Governor Paulinus' already small army was made even smaller when one legion refused to answer his call to arms and another got routed while trying to reach him. In total, Paulinus had only 10,000 men to his name against Boudicca's 230,000 (per Romans accounts). Emperor Nero found the situation so hopeless that he considered abandoning Britain altogether. Inspite of this overwhelming odds, Paulinus chose to fight on his own terms rather than run, eventually picking a bottleneck location where Boudica's superior number was ineffective and attacking her entire army head-on. The poorly-equipped Iceni warriors were no match for the heavily-armored Romans and died in droves. The battle might not have ended in total disaster had it not been for one giant blunder from Boudica's part. She had set up some wagons behind her army to let their families witness a triumphant victory over the Romans, only for those wagons to end up preventing <em>her</em> army from escaping when the battle went south for them instead. Unable to retreat, the panicked Iceni got absolutely massacred. Her rebellion fell apart soon after this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackDefeat">Crack Defeat</a>.</span>
