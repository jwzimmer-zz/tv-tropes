</div></div><p>Fans sometimes blame the wrong people, and thus misblame somebody. Comes in multiple varieties:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p></p><h2>Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>
<p>There are actual weaknesses in the original work, which were faithfully translated in an adaptation.
</p><p>For example, you see an anime or manga with great action sequences and an interesting premise, punctuated by bizarre changes by the translators that cheapen said premise, provide a jarring tone, or even make the plot nonsense. You assume it's fallen victim to a <em>serious</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a>. So you import the DVD, maybe get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RegionCoding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RegionCoding">region 2 player</a> if you live outside the region, and put it in... Surprise! It's not a Macekre after all; what you thought was caused by overzealous translators was just a weakness in the original work. And yet, the fans have misblamed the translators, and they're not going to stop any time soon.
</p><p>It's less common for audiences nowadays who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">access</a> to the original material beforehand.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><h2>Most visible target</h2>
<p>Writers and those working the grindmill of day-to-day creative production are just trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">do their best</a> making a good show/movie/comic book. Unfortunately, the demands of the executives to try and make it more popular become a kink in the creative flow.
</p><p>For example, a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">story arc</a> emerges that turns the characters inside out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">the fans respond with bile and hatred.</a> Upon exiting that story arc, everything returns to the status quo. Odds are, such major changes are demanded as a method to shake up the series and blindsides you because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">it was shoehorned into a narrative</a> the writers already had planned out.
</p><p></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2>"The creator is GOD!"</h2>
<p>Blaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> when the author did it on purpose, without any executive mandate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyPlottedAPerfectlyGoodWaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyPlottedAPerfectlyGoodWaste">perhaps with good cause</a>, perhaps with poor cause.
</p><p>The mere existence of meddling executives often gives the impression that they are tyrants, slave driving the humble writer. But even the glorified writers are prone to mistakes and their own issues, which is chronicled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> and other tropes.
</p><p>For example, your favorite character is subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderization</a> and you assume that the executives demanded the supposedly "flatter" personality. But the writer's blog reveals that the change was made because it made writing for the character easier and allowed for more story possibilities.
</p><p></p><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> poisoning its own well</h2>
<p>The ultimate difficulties of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a>, laying down false information and establishing opinion as fact. The information is then spread across the Internet and only information from the source can correct it.
</p><p>This is an example of when the fan dumb just doesn't fact check. They blame someone who worked on it for an error when they actually didn't even do that much behind it. A very common form of this is when people blame a company that worked on something that was subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>, when in reality, the blamed company was merely a financial backer or they didn't have <em>any</em> involvement whatsoever and merely published it.
</p><p>This is often the underlying cause behind all the other types and we here are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> are not immune to it either.
</p><p>Another small set of cases that might be related are mistranslations. Some fans might accidentally translate something the wrong way and accept it as fact. This may also be the result of rumors.
</p><p></p><h2>Blame the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Scapegoat Creator</a></h2>
<p>The "Single Person" Fallacy, that somehow <em>one</em> individual is responsible for the totality of a problem or mistake that cripples a production. Or the entire production as a whole. A common name for this particular fallacy variant is the "Quarterback Syndrome", so called due to the tendency to blame the quarterback for bad plays in a game of American football.
</p><p>Take any given movie or television series. There happens to be an episode or scene that is just bad. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment">costuming is ridiculous</a>, the acting is stiff, the dialogue is clichéd, the direction is uninspired and even the lighting looks bad. Yet why is the director/showrunner blamed for it all? Well, each of those things listed are handled by a whole individual team who specialize in that field. The director has a lot of control, but if one of those elements goes sour it isn't just the director/showrunner's fault, and sometimes the director/showrunner is unable to do anything about it due to executive meddling, time/budget constraints, or some other impairment.
</p><p>A similar fallacy that applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a> is the "There are no Developers, only Publishers" Fallacy. Despite all the company logos that show when people load up a game, they only seem to see the one of the big company and tend to assume it was all their doing. Even when their input is limited to monetary support and maybe localization. To further confound this, sometimes the #1 targets for this fallacy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a>) are companies that actually <em>do</em> develop <em>and</em> publish games. There are some rumors that Japanese developers are actually glad in knowing they'll receive no credit for their work, because they'll <em>also</em> receive none of the criticism.
</p><p>This is often a result of a phenomenon called "Credits Negligence". Admit it. You yourself don't watch most credits in movies, shows, games, etc. Unless, that is, they do stuff like add in animation sequences, bloopers, small epilogues, or there's something else at the end. And even then, it's not likely you paid attention to them. Sometimes, they even scroll too fast for you to read them exactly (this happens on Television shows a lot, because they have to fit it all within a timeslot, so many times they only show the major credits and omit a lot). But nevertheless, you sometimes would actually be <em>quite</em> surprised at what one person's role really <em>was</em> in the work if you took the time to read the credits. Most haters typically won't do this, especially for games (this leads to why the "Single Person" Fallacy is often accepted as "fact" and "creditable").
</p><p>All of that said, many would say that blaming the director for an artistic demerit in a film is completely justified. After all, the director's job is overseeing all artistic decisions, so if he or she lets another person's mistake slip by unchecked, there is some culpability. Hence the popular industry ideology, "When you're the director, <em>everything</em> is your fault" (this is pretty much the same phenomenon wherein the director is also <em>credited</em> for every good thing as well). The problem in these cases is when people fail to acknowledge that the director isn't the only one to blame.
</p><p>Even <em>we</em> are susceptible to this. Both in this page and other pages on the wiki, you will see us blame a mysterious "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive</a>" for all of a show's problems.
</p><p>Misblame can be exacerbated when someone willingly takes blame for something not their fault. Among professionals, this can happen for lots of reasons:
</p><ul><li> The director of a film, or other "auteur", may take blame because they agree with the above belief that "When you're the director, everything is your fault." Even if the problem wasn't fixable or wasn't under their control.
</li><li> Someone may take blame, because casting blame on another person (even truthfully) may mean never working with that person again, or never working again, period.
</li><li> Someone may tacitly take blame because they don't want to air dirty laundry. It's very easy to get accused of being hard to work with and it's easier to take your whipping and move on.
</li><li> Someone may take blame out of a genuine desire to protect another person, especially someone who is more easily replaceable than the big names.

<ul><li> There is a tendency of fans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cancellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cancellation">canceled</a>/discontinued works to blame everybody involved in the distribution of bad faith without thinking that there might have been valid reasons. The simple reality is most shows weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, but simply just didn't get either the ratings or the advertising revenue to warrant their cost. Distribution companies don't stay afloat by losing money to appeal to niches, after all. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia">Fan Myopia</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect">The Firefly Effect</a> (which is almost a form of fan myopia in itself).
<ul><li> Also in regards to the shows is that no-one understands how good it is until much later, which means a too-long delayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> can hurt a show without any single person or group being at fault.
</li><li> Medium issues may also apply in some cases. An anime series without substantial backing isn't going to exceed 12 or 26 episodes (half or a whole television season), and a Western cartoon show will more than likely not exceed 65 (a 13-week syndication cycle).
</li></ul></li><li> On the flip side to the above, many can assume that a show was canceled because it was horrible and only horrible at that. While true for some, it's not always the case for other titles. It might have not been promoted well, it was in an unfavorable time slot or even channel, or maybe it was, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> can all too often lead to this. Sure, there is such a thing as ripoffs of course, but you'd be surprised how often these claims can be baseless. Many popular franchises that receive "imitations" were quite often not all that original to begin with (for example, how the really popular franchises more often popularize tropes than create them). There have been plenty of times in which the similarities in "ripoffs" to more "popular franchises" can be overly vague at best (such as when characters from one franchise look rather similar to someone from a more popular franchise but their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">backstories</a> are pretty much different). There are a pretty good number of so-called "ripoffs" in which the only thing they really have in common with the more popular franchise is that they are in the same genre. There have been certain cases in which even the company behind a certain popular franchise thinks so and tries to file a lawsuit against the "rip-off" and loses in the process.
<ul><li> It is also quite common for a set of circumstances to influence more than one person, so you can get a sudden glut of 'x' movies without any of them being rip offs or originals.
</li></ul></li><li> It usually takes a <em>lot</em> of people to make a movie/game/series/whatever. We as consumers and viewers usually do not know <em>exactly</em> what goes on while they're making what we're experiencing right now. On top of the fact that not all of us will see the credits, the credits may not show who did what or even leave out someone who was working on it altogether (this often happens with voice actors). Even then, the credits won't tell us who exactly did <em>what</em>, for all we know, an important decision wasn't thought up by the person we're blaming.
</li><li> Often happens with actors with significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">hate dumbs</a>. The actors/actresses will be treated like they are the worst actors ever for taking that part, despite the fact that most of them are at worst mediocre actors who are trying to work with what was written for them.
</li><li> The transition from traditional to CGI animated films in the 2000s. The people blame companies like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation">DreamWorks Animation</a> and the people who work there for making hand-drawn animation a dying art. In reality, as CGI features were becoming more popular as the 21st century dawned, many executives saw CGI as being more profitable that traditional animation, especially as Disney's legendary feature animation department was converted into a CGI house as many traditional animators were laid off. As shown in <em>The Pixar Story</em>, many of the Pixar employees love the hand-drawn Disney films and don't like the flak they're receiving for making them go down the tubes.
</li><li> When it comes to TV programs (especially animated ones), oftentimes the fans of a recently cancelled show will blame the very next show that gets announced (Especially if it happens shortly after the former is announced as cancelled) for getting their show cancelled when it just happened to be the next show in the pipeline and was likely already in production for months (or even years) beforehand. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz">The Problem Solverz</a></em> was blamed for kicking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymbionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymbionicTitan">Symbionic Titan</a></em> off the air <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mrpw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mrpw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mrpw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Actually was because of behind-the-scenes problems and merchandising issues</span>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima">Legends of Chima</a></em> was seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011">ThunderCats (2011)</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wxq8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1wxq8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wxq8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Chima was already in production beforehand, but Chima and Thundercats fans still tend to go at each other's throats</span>, and some parts of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotAndMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotAndMonster">Robot and Monster</a></em> fandom believe that the show was kicked off Nickelodeon's schedule in favor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SanjayAndCraig">Sanjay and Craig</a></em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2udrj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2udrj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2udrj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <em>Robot and Monster</em> was apparently the only show Nick seemed to regret green-lighting more than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kablam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kablam">Kablam</a></em> as they seemed prepared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screw it over</a> from the get-go, long before <em>Sanjay and Craig</em> was officially green-lit.</span> In short, TV show production just doesn't quite work that way.
</li><li> Due to the popularity of superhero movies over comic books, it's become fairly common for fans of the movies to fall into Type 1 (GIGO). The original comics are by no means garbage, but the nature of the medium has created a lot of genre staples (repeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Backs</a> to maintain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology">Sufficiently Advanced Technology</a> to treat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookDeath">Comic Book Death</a>, characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">popping in and out</a> of each others' titles, etc.) that just don't work on film. This means it's not uncommon for fans to get upset with a superhero movie's creative team over a bad idea of theirs, when in fact it wasn't their idea—it was faithfully imported from the comics and the team's only mistake was failing to realize that it could only work smoothly in print.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Translation errors</a>. This usually happens the <em>most</em> in things originating in Japan (Anime, Video games) but it happens with other languages too:
<ul><li> Many works are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">products of their times and cultures</a>. As a result, many of these may sometimes make cultural (popular or not) references that will just leave foreign (or even younger) viewers scratching their head in confusion. As a result, many translators attempt to either change these references to something as generic as possible or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">replace them with references that the foreign audience will understand</a>. Some of these also are so hard to translate that they are left in.
</li><li> Swear words. Many fan translations add swear words or innuendos that weren't there to make it sound more "Adult". Part of this may also be unintentional.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. What is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a> in one country is actually entirely acceptable, which causes a lot of confusion about when localisers take a show and make it "more kid friendly" - many actually see a show that was written for kids of one society, and attempt to show what's acceptable in the other society.
</li><li> Song lyrics - Fans of musicals or movies with songs in them often blame the musical staff for writing songs that make little sense to them - when it's actually the fault of the dubbers, who themselves struggle with trying to make the song make sense and still maintain a rhythm, especially to avoid the dreaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipLock">Lip Lock</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A lot of people blame Fredric Wertham solely for the creation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">The Comics Code</a>, while he is only indirectly responsible for it. He published <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em> which led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">social panic</a>, which led to the Code for sure. However, he was actually relatively moderate on the issue — he simply wanted comics to have a rating system, not for any remotely objectionable content to be banned.
</li><li> The role of <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em> is also often exaggerated. The book came out on 19 April 1954, a mere two days before the Senate Subcommittee hearings on juvenile delinquency (at which Wertham and William Gaines famously testified) began; this led to the adoption of the Comics Code in October of the same year. The crusade against comic-books with alarmist theories about their likely effect on readers had actually started as early as 1940, and it was only in 1948 that Wertham's theories about the subject first came to public notice. Anti-comicbook hysteria was already in full swing before <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em> (public burnings of comic-books started no later than 1948), so if Wertham was one of those who caused it, it was actually through his earlier writings and public statements.
</li><li> Additionally, it isn't as common now that the facts are better known, but superhero comic fans used to frequently blame Wertham and the Comics Code for the near-extinction of superhero comics during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheInterregnum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheInterregnum">The Interregnum</a>. In fact, superhero comics simply lost popularity because people got fed up with them, and were replaced by the crime and horror comics that really upset Wertham and other anti-comics campaigners. In fact, it was the Comics Code that directly led to the revival of superhero comics during the Silver Age. (Of course, Wertham didn't like superhero comics either, notoriously considering them to be fascist power-fantasies and alleging that heroes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">relationships</a> with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekicks</a> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoverAndBeloved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoverAndBeloved">pederastic</a> in nature.)
</li><li> Feminists seem to get a lot of blame for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s depowering in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">the Bronze Age</a>, however the complete opposite is true. While the decision to depower her was made to make the comic more appealing to feminists and women in general, DC came up with the idea all on their own — in fact it was backlash from the feminists that resulted in her getting repowered.
<ul><li> Also, both her depowering and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a>'s are often taken as extremes of sexism regardless of <em>whose</em> order you think it's on. Often ignored is the fact that they were "demoted" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a>. If you were really depowering a character because you <em>didn't like the idea of strong women,</em> you <em>wouldn't</em> make them Xena-class asskicking machines, which meant that it could have worked in theory. On the other hand, the de-powering period also coincided with her getting beaten up a lot by male villains, which, combined with less restricted content standards, came off as a lot more brutal than they otherwise would, and the idea that Wonder Woman would give up the responsibilities of her position to run a Mod clothing store in New York got dated real fast.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's Wonder Woman's position as the secretary of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a> in <em>All-Star Comics</em>. This is often blamed on sexism, since she's a secretary and didn't go on missions. In fact, it was editorial policy that any character with their own solo book couldn't be a member at all (which is why Superman and Batman weren't included and Flash and Green Lantern got kicked out when <em>All-Flash</em> and <em>Green Lantern</em> started). Wonder Woman was made an exception because of her popularity and having a back-line support position as a secretary was <em>better</em> than similar male heroes who didn't get to be there at all.
</li><li> Bob Budiansky gets a <em>lot</em> of flak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> fans for horrible writing in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Marvel comic</a>, while Simon Furman is praised as the saviour of the series. They tend to ignore the fact that most of Budiansky's work was praised when it was originally released, and he even got a fan letter from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> for the "Decepticon Graffiti" story. The majority of Budiansky's work was easily as good as Furman's, but his entire opus was tainted by the burnout he suffered in his last few issues as he tried desperately to keep up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Hasbro's demands</a>. In fact, some of his popular work is occasionally misattributed to Furman for just this reason.
<ul><li> Also, the extent to which the franchise is Budiansky's handiwork is often not understood — the early Marvel guys, him among them, were the people who were handed a bunch of toys and told to make them characters and a universe. <em>Without him, Transformers as you know it never comes to be.</em> If you're a TF fan, you have Bob to thank for way more of the things about the franchise you love than you realize — <em>whichever</em> series or comic happens to be your favorite, because all of them build on that original work to some extent.
<ul><li> The good new is that these misunderstandings have mostly cleared up, and the hate for Budiansky has largely died down.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Blaming Bob Harras for most Spider-man stories of the 90s including The Clone Saga, demonstrated in <a class="urllink" href="http://comiccritics.com/2010/10/10/textual-harrasment/">Comic Critics: "Textual Harrasment"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Harras is responsible for some of the bad comics of the time, most notably the Mackie/Byrne run where he demanded ideas the team disliked. But the Clone Saga wasn't really his fault. After EIC Defalco was stripped off his power by a decision to divide EIC into separate teams with each team encouraged to rival and compete with each other for success, Harras who was in charge of the X-Men stable, and had no involvement in the early part of the Clone Saga which writers and editors spun wheels around, and Harras arrived at the tail end, inheriting a major mess which he, to his credit, resolved. It's unlikely anyone in his position would have done different in that situation given how badly that story was managed at the time. And the decision he did take, bringing Norman Osborn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> was ultimately seen as a good one by most comics fans.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, some people sure love pinning everything DC Comics is doing "wrong" on either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> is apparently solely responsible for every hated story to come out of Marvel offices, during his tenure, he planned them, wrote them, drew them, colored them, lettered them, with no help from anyone, especially the creative team assigned to the book. Quesada's job is EIC (Editor-In-Chief) which means he commissions, vetoes, or otherwise takes a decision on story and idea, but he doesn't dictate every little twist and turn, and while he did start out as an artist, he only did the artwork for a few issues. For instance, <em>Sins' Past</em> a story by JMS which originally was planned to have Gwen be revealed as Peter's babymama was vetoed by Quesada who objected to Peter and Gwen having unprotected sex as young people, the idea of kids aging Spider-Man, and furthermore the perception of Spider-Man as "deadbeat dad". Quesada did suggest changing the father to Norman Osborn, which most would agree was a terrible idea, but it was still JMS' choice to write that story and take that suggestion rather than withdraw it once his idea was proving unworkable.
</li><li> Quesada is most famous and notorious for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> which was also blamed on writer JMS who was initially blamed for creating the story until it was known Quesada ordered it (the fact that Quesada served as artist/editor and had story credit was a dead giveaway and as EIC he was more than content to take credit for an idea that he had never made any secret of, namely ending Spider-Man's marriage). JMS differed from Quesada in that where the EIC wanted the retcon to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> status-quo where every story happened with Peter and MJ in a relationship but not married, even if such a decision entirely altered whole scenes, moments, and the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> of multiple characters, JMS wanted to create a more logical change that would allow for character progression and be grounded on their history.
<ul><li> Likewise, as Quesada insists and later writers confirmed, while few people actually defend One More Day as a good story or a well-executed plan (even Quesada defends it from a corporate perspective) a good number of Spider-Man writers in the past and others in Marvel approved of the justification, namely that Spider-Man should be young, hip, and relatable, and that his marriage to Mary Jane wasn't the correct decision for the character. This includes writers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerStern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerStern">Roger Stern</a> (who says he isn't against the idea of Spider-Man being married or married superheroes, and indeed wrote Superman's wedding vows to Lois Lane in <em>Superman Wedding Album,</em> but that Mary Jane isn't the right girl for him and that they'd be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway">Gerry Conway</a> (who wholeheartedly believes that Peter and Mary Jane <em>are</em> meant for each other and created their love story to start with, but he again feels it should never happen in the regular continuity, and should be done only for special AU and one-offs), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a> among others. There were writers who liked the marriage and wanted to keep it include JMS, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction">Matt Fraction</a> but out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingPersonalIsntProfessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingPersonalIsntProfessional">professional ethics they followed the company line</a>, since the decision to take it was also mandated by executives. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>, who reportedly tried to sneak a plot development into his <em>Siege</em> storyline that would've tacitly undone <em>One More Day</em> until Quesada caught on. Though whether that is Bendis being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> or being casually indifferent to continuity (as he has been known to do, owing to the fact that he has far less experience as a serial writer than working with a blank slate).
</li><li> Others point out that while Quesada ended the marriage, he also oversaw some of the best stories in that entire period. Namely JMS' Spider-Man where Quesada didn't say anything against the plans to bring the couple back from separation from the Mackie-Byrne era, which happened before his tenure and which he had criticized, noting that it was absolutely out of character for Peter and Mary Jane Watson to ever divorce given their devotion to one another, after everything they have been through together. Likewise, Matt Fraction used his fore-knowledge to write "To Have and to Hold" (which Quesada approved) as a tribute to their iconic love story and their marriage and which Fraction said was a cheap shot and "dirty pool" to show the direction Spider-Man could take with a married Peter. Quesada also defended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a>, the daughter of the couple in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> line from multiple cancellations and states that is the natural progression of their relationship. Many writers note the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a> that the period right before the marriage ended, proved the great potential for storytelling and opportunities a married Spider-Man brought to the title, much of which encouraged by Quesada as a kind of last hurrah.
</li><li> Dan Slott pointed out that the decision to end the marriage happened on the corporate level to protect Spider-Man's status as the company mascot and it wasn't necessarily about seeing Peter Parker as a character in a story. It was something that earlier editors had been asked and pressured to do, and tried to do, and it would have likely happened without Quesada. Of course whether anyone else would have done it without the same backlash and weak execution, and in a way that provided catharsis for the people who liked it, and didn't amount to telling audiences that the thing they liked was a mistake and unimportant, is a separate question altogether.
</li></ul></li><li> Ken Penders has been given a <em>lot</em> of his from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> fans, and comes in two flavors: bad stories misattributed to him, and dangling plot threads misexplained as him being a douche. In reality, most fans tend to forget that Ken lost his position as head writer to Karl Bollers for a good chunk of the timeframe most of the misattributed stories come from (in reality written by Bollers himself), and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> was pretty much a staple of the comic ever since issue 50, leading to confusion over whether Ken left the comic voluntarily due to conflicts with this meddling, or if he was fired because of it. Even the favorite accusations of old fans that he turned the Echidnas into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> that dragged down the main comic's quality seems to be off, as he had little choice in the matter, and the Knuckles comic that came from it, despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, is still considered one of the best parts of the comic. Granted, there <em>are</em> bad stories that Ken has done, but not nearly the amount that is attributed to him. On his twitter account, he will gladly tell anyone who thinks he's the reason why the comic was rebooted his side of things.
<ul><li> In the late issues, a number of characters that Penders created have been removed or gone missing while Archie and Penders work out some legal issues over the rights to said characters, causing numerous edits in varying degrees of severity. For all the flak Penders has gotten, Archie's legal team was behind their removal. Technically there wasn't anything wrong in using them, but said legal team didn't want to risk fanning the flames.
</li><li> Prior to the above mess, fans were quite dismayed about the application of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> towards the AI NICOLE, with many fans saying that Ian's usage of it was too much. Many people seem to have forgotten that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> in the comics was a prevalent feature as the comic left its goofy roots.

</li><li> Jack Schiff got blamed for injecting sci-fi elements into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s stories. In truth, it was editorial director Irwin Donenfeld's fault for having sci-fi be put into the DC output. Schiff recognised that aliens, spaceships, and the like had no place in Batman's detective storylines, and in fact, sci-fi is outside his aptitude as an editor. He argued against the management, but eventually gave in to pressure.

In reality, both of these stories were mandated by the same man, editor Eddie Berganza, and both times the writers fought against him; Johns lost out, but Robinson actually scored a major victory, believe it or not, as Berganza's version would have destroyed <em>all</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>'s fictional cities except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Metropolis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Gotham</a>.
<ul><li> While Geoff Johns had received controversy for turning Bart Allen into Kid Flash, the blame is more accurately shared with Eddie Berganza for that first transition. Johns felt that having Bart mature would develop his character further (although obviously not many fans agreed), while Berganza had wanted Bart to be more of a "brand" character in the title. However, Bart's rapid-aging to become the new Flash was mandated by Berganza and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a>, a development that Mark Waid expressed disappointment and irritation over, stating that Berganza seemed to be an editor that "hated anything fun" in the DCU. Even with the backstory explained, you'll still see some fans cry foul on Johns for going along with the Kid Flash edict and not quitting the title in protest.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> did not retcon Damian Waynes origin as Talia drugging and raping Batman. The graphic novel people usually cite as proof of this is <em>Son of the Demon</em>, which was an Elseworlds story and has never been considered canon. Even in that story the issue is a bit murky as Batman had been given drugs by the League earlier in it. (Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Morrison himself</a> says he <em>intended</em> Damian to be a reference to <em>Son of the Demon</em> and "messed up the details, like Batman wasn't drugged when he was having sex". So it's a reference error, but not a <em>continuity</em> error, because the story he was referencing wasn't in continuity until he referenced it, at which point it was only canon <em>to the extent</em> that he referenced it.)
<ul><li> Damian's death was blamed on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> reboot and touted by fans as "Yet another example of how the <em>New 52</em> is ruining DC's characters." In reality, Morrison had planned Damian's death from the beginning, and had set the plan into motion long before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> was even announced, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> given that for the first few years of his creation, there were quite the amount of fans that were indeed wishing for his death...
</li></ul></li><li> A frequent complaint from fans is that DC mistreats the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em>, and that in-universe, that period in Justice League history is unfairly considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. In reality, the perception of the JLI as a blotch on the League's history dates back to the actual series itself, where writers Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis made constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecating</a> jokes about how the team was poorly regarded by other superheroes. The later reunion series, <em>Formerly Known as the Justice League</em>, even had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Captain Marvel</a> looking back on their time with the JLI as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.
</li><li> Certain fans of the original Richard Rider version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova">Nova</a> blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a> for killing him off to replace him with Sam Alexander, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionLegacy">who is half-Latino</a> and therefore touted as proof of Rich falling victim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingToBeReplaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingToBeReplaced">Dying to Be Replaced</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>. What these accusations usually ignore is that Rider had actually died several years earlier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative">The Thanos Imperative</a></em>, well before Sam was created. Jeph Loeb is guilty of a lot of things, but in this case the worst he can be blamed for is not resurrecting Richard.
<ul><li> As a perfect example, someone sent hate mail to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>' blog accusing him of hating Richard Rider. Bendis simply reiterated the point that Richard was already dead way before he had been hired to write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, and that the ones who killed him were Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning.
</li></ul></li><li> The same criticisms were leveled at Jaime Reyes, the newest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a>, several years prior. Some fans complained about Ted Kord (the previous Blue Beetle) supposedly being killed off for the sake of diversity, when in reality, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithGiffen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithGiffen">Keith Giffen</a> (considered by most to be Ted's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy">Real Daddy</a>) says it's the <em>exact opposite</em> situation. It had already been decided that Ted would die in the lead-up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, and Jaime Reyes was only conceived as a replacement <em>after</em> plans for Ted's death were finalized.

</li><li> Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso was not responsible for relaunching the publisher with Marvel NOW!, it was actually Joe Quesada's idea.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> #200, the infamous issue where Ms. Marvel becomes impregnated and gives birth to her own impregnator before going off to have a "happy ending" with him has four writer credits: writers David Michelinie and Bob Layton, artist George Perez and then-Editor-in-Chief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter">Jim Shooter</a>. Both Mark Gruenwald and David Michelinie have said the issue was a last minute re-write due to similarities to another comic coming out around the same time (specifically Carol was supposed to be impregnated by the Kree's Supreme Intelligence originally; the other comic was a similar plot in <em>What If</em>) and according to Gruenwald Shooter's involvement was essentially the decree that they needed to find a different father. Still despite a book re-written by committee at the last minute Shooter, perhaps because of his infamous reputation, is generally the sole person blamed for that issue.
</li><li> As with Spider-Man: One More Day, Straczynski gets let off the hook for Sins Past and the editorial staff took the blame. However it's difficult to ignore the fact that the actual premise (Gwen Stacy having not one, but TWO off-panel pregnancies before she died) was entirely Straczynski's idea. Though the editors did put the kibosh on Straczynski's original idea, which was for the kids to be Peter's children, and not Norman Osborn's!
</li><li> Whenever writers touch upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Jason Todd</a>'s death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily">A Death in the Family</a></em> in other stories, his death is usually blamed on Jason himself being implusive—which is not even close to what happened. While Jason was impulsive and did have a temper, he was lured into a trap by Sheila Haywood, who he found out was his biological mother.
</li><li> Issue #12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Saga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Saga">Saga</a></em> wasn't for sale on the iOS version of digital comics storefront Comixology due to two panels depicting gay oral sex on Prince Robot IV's screen. People originally pinned this on Apple forbidding it, but it turned out that Comixology forbid it based on their interpretation of the Apple rules. Apple then said that they never banned it, and the comic was reinstated.
</li><li> A number of Dark Age DC fans blame the cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em>'s fourth self-named book on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDidio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDidio">Dan Didio</a> and alleged old-school fans and writers who supposedly hated the Earth Angel Supergirl and wanted her out of the way of Kara Zor-El. In reality the book was always in hot water due to perpetually dismal sales, and the decision to cancel it was taken long before Kara was reintroduced because of her less convoluted backstory (and not because of old-school fans).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen">New X-Men</a></em> is highly divisive among <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> fans for many reasons, but many fans blame the run for robbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> of his moral ambiguity and turning him back into a supervillain. While Morrison's interpretation of the character (who was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> as an imposter) <em>is</em> one of his unsympathetic portrayals by far, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> actually returned Magneto to supervillain status back in the early 90s—over a decade before Morrison came along.
</li><li> A case of avoiding this very thing being the reason for a writer's departure is Len Kaminski leaving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>. Kaminski, who had a well-received run on the book, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-teen-tony-stark-quit/">revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCrossing">The Crossing</a></em>, the story that came after his run, was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and after realizing the editorial staff had chosen to ignore his protests, he chose to get the hell out of dodge than have this trope happen to him.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Films — Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A very common misconception about the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> directed it, especially when the trailers said "From the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em>". Actually, Henry Selick directed both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em> <strong>and</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> (Burton just produced), and he doesn't always have a similar style like Tim Burton does with at least 60% of his films. (Including stop-motion.) That misconception seemed to be what the marketing was aiming for (probably figuring that implying Burton's involvement would get more people to see it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Nine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Nine">9</a></em> suffered from this as well. Tim Burton's name was attached to the movie and people assumed — partly because of the weird animation style, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn">Scenery Gorn</a>, and dark themes — that the whole thing was his. <em>Shane Acker</em> came up with the concept, co-wrote, and directed, while Burton just produced it. Also, people blamed Burton for taking the credit even though he clearly credits himself a producer.
</li><li> While many people assume Disney forced Pixar to make their first critical failure, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2">Cars 2</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">to drive merchandise sales</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/movies/john-lasseter-of-pixar-defends-cars-2.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2">John Lasseter insisted this wasn't the case.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Lasseter came up with the idea of a sequel starring Mater when he was promoting the first film.
</li><li> Much of the Hatedom for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Planes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Planes">Planes</a></em> is aimed at Pixar despite the movie being filmed and animated by DisneyToon Studios. It didn't help that the movie was executive produced by John Lasseter.
</li><li> When it was announced that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a></em> would be remade, a lot of people have credited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a>'s adaptation of being even more faithful and how this would automatically be less faithful. Yeah sure, Bluth's version does follow the book it was based off of...for the most part. Those who read the books would know that Jenner actually didn't stick around and plot to murder a terrifying Nicodemus and succeed...he actually deserted the rat colony, was overheard of as being electrocuted by a car motor (with other deserters), and Nicodemus actually did not die. On top of the fact that, you know, the film isn't even in theatres yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">and, considering very little has been mentioned since the first announcement, may never happen at all.</a>
<ul><li> This would be one thing if this was announced in the 80s. Don Bluth probably didn't <em>know</em> there would be any others, since the movie was made <em>before</em> the two other NIMH books were written.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaChick">The Nostalgia Chick</a>'s review of the film, she blames <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow">Barry Manilow</a> for the songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thumbelina1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thumbelina1994">Thumbelina</a></em>, despite the fact that he only wrote the music, not the lyrics.
</li><li> Despite popular belief, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmojiMovie">The Emoji Movie</a></em> was NOT responsible for Sony's nixing of Gennedy Tartakovsky's <em>Popeye</em> movie. The two movies were developed in two different time frames, separated by the fateful Sony hack and the subsequent shuffling of executive positions, making it more of a case of unfortunate timing more than anything.

As Hartman <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ggrjOmJ7TNI">explained<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, his take on the dub was much closer to the original English version with the Britishisms toned down, but Weinstein ordered more re-writes late in production with an emphasis on pop culture jokes (some of it done by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked">Hoodwinked!</a></em> director Cory Edwards). For the record, Hartman considers <em>Doogal</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.

In reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> was trying to convince <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHillenburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHillenburg">Stephen Hillenburg</a> to renew the show for a fourth season between 2002 and 2004, and he refused, so they hired Paul Tibbit instead. In fact, new episodes couldn't have been produced between the movie's release and Season 4's release, as the two were only six months apart (November 2004 and May 2005 respectively), while <em>SpongeBob</em> episodes take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime">at least nine months to produce</a>.
</li><li> Despite some of the questionable choices Cartoon Network made in the 2010s, greenlighting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies">Teen Titans Go!

Many of these critics (perhaps the most prominent was <em>Newsweek</em> critic David Ansen) misblame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> for making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> for making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Star Wars</a></em>, because this supposedly "ruined" the New Hollywood era, and replaced it with the "inferior" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBlockbusterAgeOfHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBlockbusterAgeOfHollywood">Blockbuster Age of Hollywood</a>. This argument and sentiment, while valid on the face of it (and something even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> has admitted is true), ignores a lot of other industry trends, and other mistakes made at the time. Namely the fact that the more artistically inclined film-makers never bothered to leverage their gains into gaining legal recognition as artists and access to copyrights (which their French counterparts did), that the film industry was so weak that it was being bought out by corporations at the time. The era lasted long primarily because of tax-breaks from the Nixon government which amounted (<a class="urllink" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/17/entertainment/ca-dargis17/2">in critic Manohla Dargis' words<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) to a virtual subsidy of the film industry, a fact which did not stop Hollywood from biting the hand that fed it.
<ul><li> Likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> is very much a film of the New Hollywood. As historians point out, towards the middle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, several Hollywood film-makers became invested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">Genre Throwback</a> and nostalgia, reviving older Hollywood genres by updating it for a contemporary audience. They note that the film-makers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis">Became Their Own Antithesis</a> in that they started out making low-budget films for adults but towards the end of the decade, decided to make large-scale epic films of the kind that caused so much trouble for Hollywood in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>. These films were expensive, but at the same time, still fused with experimental and discordant touches. The first <em>Star Wars</em> film was made with atypical actors of the kind who would not be typical action heroes in the golden age and on a relatively small budget, and more or less treated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a> serials with the same quality as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie">Epic Movie</a>. In short, <em>Star Wars</em> is the New Hollywood becoming a victim of its own success.
</li><li> On a related note, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate">Heaven's Gate</a></em> tends to be regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">The Millstone</a> for the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood">New Hollywood</a> generation and as a flop that bankrupted the studio. While these facts are true, a lot of it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> since the production failure was as much the fault of inexperienced producers as director Michael Cimino and the former have tended to latch on to the latter as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Scapegoat Creator</a>. The post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> trend at the time was already making it difficult for directors to make more personal films with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAltman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAltman">Robert Altman</a> moving to France in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, despite being the most prolific film-maker of the period. The film itself is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> as the last true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie">Epic Movie</a> and was released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection">The Criterion Collection</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em>:
<ul><li> Before the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em> film, a 1994 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Script/Godzilla1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Script/Godzilla1994">Godzilla</a></em> film was planned. The film was originally going to have Godzilla fight against a giant monster named the Gryphon and have special effects done by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanWinston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanWinston">Stan Winston</a> Studios. A misconception that has been circulating was that the reason the Gryphon never manifested was because Toho vetoed the idea, and proposed Mothra and King Ghidorah instead. Both were turned down because they were extremely expensive. The real reason was actually worse. <br/><br/>The real season is that Sony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executives disagreed about the budget</a> and caused the would be director Jan De Bont to drop out. There were several attempts to re-negotiate, and get a director, Tri-Star brought in Roland Emmerich (the first director to turn down directing <em>Godzilla</em> 1994 because he explicitly stated that he didn't like Godzilla.) and Dean Devlin. The condition they agreed to direct was that they would rewrite the entire thing however they wanted, and we <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">all know how that went.</a> The even sadder irony is that the budget went way over the budget Sony didn't agree on, meaning that the whole screw-up was really meaningless.
</li><li> The belief that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a></em> was edited for the US release to make King Kong win instead of Godzilla. Like <em>Battle of the Planets</em>, it was indeed heavily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekred</a>, but this wasn't part of it — the movie was one of the earlier ones, before Godzilla became a hero, which meant Godzilla had to lose (though not <em>die</em>) in every movie. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/godzilla.asp">Snopes.com confirms<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This claim is so prevalent that even resources discussing the movies have mistakenly portrayed it as true.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the complaints about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001">2001 remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em> was in its ending, which is significantly different from the original film. However, the new ending is actually closer to that of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">original book</a>.
<ul><li> There's also the fact that Burton's creative input may have been exaggerated to get the film extra publicity.
</li></ul></li><li> The same complaints were alleged at Burton's adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>. Most of the complaints were, in fact, not departures from the original book, but actually more faithful to the book than the last movie was. The "changed" lyrics to the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers, for example, are directly lifted from lyrics in the book. One <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2005/07/charlie_and_the_chocolate_fact.html">prominent film critic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> complained that the Burton adaptation chickened out by showing that the bad children survived their ordeals, where the 70s film had stayed "faithful" — but the Burton film was actually being faithful to an identical scene in the book. The only drastic change to the film came towards the end with the subplot about Wonka's father, which is all Burton. The bad kids survived in the 70s movie, too, but a lot of people, including that film critic, apparently missed the line explaining it.
<ul><li> It should also perhaps be noted that, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">many fans of the original film disown the Burton remake</a>, the remake actually exists, in part, because Roald Dahl was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisownedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisownedAdaptation">unhappy with how the original film turned out</a>. His will even forbade future filmmakers from adapting the novel's sequel, <em>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</em>, into a film — which is why Burton's remake doesn't have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> that the original did. Legitimate criticism of the remake notwithstanding, Dahl's widow personally gave it her blessing, saying that she felt that it was closer to her husband's vision than the original.
</li></ul></li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a>'s</em> most recent run on television, it became popular to blame everything that had ever gone wrong with the franchise on Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. This became most noticeable with the flop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em>, with both being blamed for the screenplay, along with the fact that the film was released in the same week as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>. Braga was completely innocent, and had nothing whatsoever to do with <em>Nemesis</em> (or even the previous film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em>). Berman was arguably responsible to some extent, as he contributed to the storyline and happily gave screenwriter John Logan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">a no rewrites clause</a>, but the two big things he gets criticised for — the release date and the decision to hire Stuart Baird as director despite Baird knowing nothing about the franchise — were decisions made by Paramount without consulting Berman.
</li><li> Some odd-seeming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeDevices">Narrative Devices</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plots">Plots</a> in old movies have been misblamed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">Hays Office</a> censorship. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> may be a better explanation.)
</li><li> As for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor">Pearl Harbor</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> didn't put that in. It was Randall Wallace.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a> </em> was first released to middling reviews, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> took most of the blame for its incoherence. However once people were able to watch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD">extended cut included on home release</a>, the criticism shifted towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidYates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidYates">David Yates</a> and the editing team for cutting out vital parts of exposition. A total of 14 minutes were cut with the most baffling omission being a scene that clocked in at only forty seconds that had Dumbledore explaining why exactly he had sent Newt to New York in the first film.
</li><li> Blaming every last thing about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> on director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelSchumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> is practically standard issue (to the point where his very strong filmography leading up to it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">is completely dismissed in discussions</a>), but his actual involvement wasn't as great as stated. While the overly goofy tone of the film, gaudy visuals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Bat</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment">Nipples</a> were indeed his fault, he was only loosely involved with writing the film; he helped screenwriter Akiva Goldsman come up with a story outline, then went off to direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATimeToKill">A Time to Kill</a></em>, during which time Goldsman finished the screenplay mostly by himself, albeit with the studio execs demanding the inclusion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> to help sell more toys. At worst, Schumacher just turned what would have been a very poor film regardless into an even bigger mess.
<ul><li> This can also extend to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever">Batman Forever</a></em>, which, while it was better-received than its successor, is largely seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">origin</a> of many of the problems <em>B&amp;R</em> would face. Schumacher wanted to adapt <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, and even had a script written with the help of the comic's author, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>; however, because the dark tone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> was blamed for the film underperforming, the studio forced him to make a much more lighthearted film.
</li></ul></li><li> When it was eventually released, the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> met with a lukewarm response. Fans were quick to blame most of the elements that they disliked on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> which butchered Douglas Adams' vision... apparently unaware that most of the more contentious material (such as the increased focus on the romance between Arthur and Trillian and the Humma Kavula subplot) were actually put in there by Adams himself.
<ul><li> For that matter, pretty much <em>every</em> adaptation of <em>Hitchhiker's Guide</em> was criticized for differences from the source material and crying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay">Adaptation Decay</a>", despite the fact that Adams was directly involved with every one of them that was made when he was alive, and intentionally designed each of them to have significant differences from one another.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AIArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AIArtificialIntelligence">A.I.: Artificial Intelligence</a></em> was an idea and script created by legendarily cold, clinical director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, so when it was picked up after Kubrick's death by his hand-chosen successor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, a director notorious for his warm, humanistic and occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmy</a> disposition, many Kubrick fans immediately wrote it off, and when they saw it, blamed everything they saw was a weakness on Spielberg, but most of the things blamed on Spielberg (specifically the robotic talking teddy bear that is David's accompaniment throughout the film) were present in Kubrick's original script, and in fact may have been why Kubrick gave the project to Spielberg prior to his death, saying it was "closer to his sensibilities". The rather controversial <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a></span> ending was also completely planned by Kubrick and not Spielberg.
</li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fans seem to dislike Michael Gambon as Dumbledore in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">the films</a>. Some of this stems from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">comparing him with the late Richard Harris</a>, but the rest seems to point towards "the yelling in Goblet of Fire". More recently, established fans seem to have shifted blame on the yelling scene to the director, though new fans are always around to dig up the old chestnut.
<ul><li> By now, it's pretty much taken as gospel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveKloves">Steve Kloves</a> is your average foamy-mouthed delusional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Harmonian</a>. The idea that he simply thought Harry and Hermione might end up together isn't actually unfounded, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> mentioned once that "Steve Kloves who has been the script writer, who is enormously insightful on the series and a very good friend, after he read book seven he said to me, 'You know, I thought something was going to happen between Harry and Hermione, and I didn't know whether I wanted it or not.'" On the other hand, this statement clearly indicates that Kloves did not have an actual preference for Harry/Hermione, he just thought it might happen, and much less that he was actively inserting Harry/Hermione moments into the screenplays even after the ship didn't sail.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009">Sherlock Holmes (2009)</a></em> differs greatly from <em>other adaptations</em>, especially the classic, genteel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasilRathbone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasilRathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyBrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyBrett">Jeremy Brett</a> interpretations, but one only has to look at the laundry-list of continuity nods on that page to realize that in terms of characterization, the new film is remarkably faithful to Doyle's stories — just in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">different direction</a> from previous adaptations.
<ul><li> In the same vein, a common criticism of the 2011 sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows">Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</a></em>, is that it "dumbed down" Sherlock Holmes by largely replacing the mystery and complex deductions with elaborate fight scenes and large-scale action set pieces — essentially turning Holmes into "Victorian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>". While it's understandable that people would like to see mystery in a movie about Sherlock Holmes, it should be noted that <em>A Game of Shadows</em> was based (albeit very loosely) on elements of the classic Doyle stories "The Final Problem" and "The Adventure of the Empty House" — both of which were essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakAndDagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakAndDagger">Cloak &amp; Dagger</a> adventure stories, with no central mystery at all. Hell, if you've read either of those stories, you'll notice that the screenwriters actually took pains to <em>add</em> elements of mystery where there weren't any in the source material. <em>A Game of Shadows</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">the climactic reveal</a> about the true nature of Moriarty's plans and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> how Holmes managed to figure them out midway through the movie</span>, while "The Final Problem" just has a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternChase">Stern Chase</a> across Europe.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> is usually blamed for absolutely everything wrong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em>. While he made mistakes and his original idea was far too big and polarizing to ever truly be filmable (both of which he admits to, repeatedly, in his various books), the final product was actually a result of these being massively compounded by just about everything that could possibly go wrong with a movie, from delays to poor results from hired companies to equipment malfunction<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note338rt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note338rt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note338rt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not to mention the 1988 Writers' Strike happening smack dab in the middle of a rushed pre-production</span>, resulting in the cutting, alteration, or downgrading of numerous scenes. The majority of this was simply beyond his control, and the fact that he even got the movie made in <em>any</em> coherent form is an accomplishment.
<ul><li> On a different note, some fans blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> for the film's virtual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> status. While it's true that Roddenberry didn't want to acknowledge the film as true <em>Star Trek</em>, he actually felt the same way about <em>all</em> of the <em>Trek</em> films after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em>, and if anything, fellow executive producer Rick Berman was probably more proactive in squashing continuity references to Original Series films and episodes. As for why <em>The Final Frontier</em> seemed to get this treatment much harder than other TOS material, well, the writing staff responsible for most of televised <em>Star Trek</em> from TNG Season 3 onwards simply thought that the film was complete garbage and didn't want their episodes to be associated with it in any way, shape or form.

Others blame the film's original director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewVaughn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewVaughn">Matthew Vaughn</a>, for screwing the film over by quitting right before the start of filming, and still others hold both men equally to blame. In actual fact, while you could make legitimate criticisms about both Ratner's direction and Vaughn's decision to quit, neither of them were responsible for the storyline. That was about 90% the same as the final film well before Vaughn had signed up, and neither director was permitted to make any serious changes to the screenplay (which, despite him giving "family reasons" for his decision to quit, was apparently a major factor in Vaughn leaving the film).
<ul><li> Ironically, many fans actually blame <em>Bryan Singer</em> for everything wrong with <em>The Last Stand</em>. Despite (or perhaps even <em>because of</em>) Singer departing the franchise to direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, and having nothing to do with <em>X3</em> at all!
</li></ul></li><li> While most reviewers managed to avoid falling into the trap of blaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> for the screenplay of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CopOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CopOut">Cop Out</a></em>, which he didn't write, many blamed him for what were felt to be weak action sequences in the movie. In fact, Smith didn't direct any of the major action scenes — David R. Ellis (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a> 2</em> and <em>4</em> fame) was brought in to handle those.
<ul><li> Of course, Smith was still the overall supervisor <em>and</em> the editor of the movie, so he was still responsible for making sure they looked competent.
</li><li> On the other hand, some critics <strong>did</strong> think that Smith had written <em>Cop Out</em>, and misblamed him accordingly. Some acknowledged that he hadn't written the screenplay, but said that he should have rewritten it himself and so still deserved blame (which is a slightly more valid viewpoint, though rather naive of how things generally work in Hollywood).

Oft cited are scenes in which it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">isn't actually Portman</a></em> in the Queen Amidala makeup.

</li><li> Portman and both actors who played Anakin had a very poor script to work with, and Lucas insisted on an overly-melodramatic acting style to mimic old 30s and 40s adventure serials. There's a behind-the-scenes clip of Hayden Christensen doing an excellent line read, only to have George come in and coach him to do it again in a more drab and stilted manner.

More generally, pretty much every single detail in the script that can possibly be perceived as a flaw tends to get dumped on Abrams, which completely ignores the fact that he co-wrote the movie with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt.

</li><li> Given how Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy is blamed for anything goes wrong with a new Star Wars movie, many point to her for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> by hiring Lord and Miller only to fire them midway through production. In actuality, it was writer Lawrence Kasdan who wanted them to work on the project before he later realized that they weren't the best fit for the story.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">throughly reviled</a> Jar Jar Binks (arguably the single most unpopular part of the prequel trilogy) gets criticized for an awful lot of reasons, but one of the most common criticisms of the character is that his thick faux-Caribbean accent makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews">an insulting caricature of African-Americans</a>. While George Lucas may have come up with the general concept of a non-human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a> character, several behind-the-scenes accounts have claimed that the accent wasn't actually his idea. In fact, Jar Jar's actor Ahmed Best (who actually <em>is</em> African-American, and of partial Caribbean ancestry) has actually claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">he came up with it himself</a> while experimenting with different voices in pre-production, and that he got the idea while imitating his Jamaican uncle.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> and the screenwriters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> may be guilty of many crimes against art, but they did not, as the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/movies/Transformers__Revenge_of_the_Fallen_2009.aspx">Agony Booth review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> accuses, feel the need to "make up a new character like the Fallen instead of using someone (or something) established like Unicron." The Fallen was a pre-existing character, taken from the comics. (The review was later corrected.)
<ul><li> Meanwhile, Michael Bay suffers type 5 misblame, apparently being singlehandedly responsible for <em>everything</em> one dislikes about the movies, up to and including things like new characters with the names of older characters (a well-established practice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> in general, as a method of maintaining trademarks to avoid repeats of what happened to characters like <strike>Trailbreaker</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">Trailcutter</a>).
</li><li> If Bay's name is in the credits at all, expect people to dump on it and dismiss it as pure garbage before it's even released. Once it is released, they will blame him for any flaws, real or perceived, even if he was only the executive producer (meaning he or his production company footed the bill, but that he likely had no creative input). Some dismissed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSails">Black Sails</a></em> before it aired merely because it came from his production company.
</li><li> Forget Michael Bay, Shia Labeouf is actually the person personally responsible for everything wrong with <em>Transformers</em>. He's also the responsible for every fault of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">fourth</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> movie.
</li><li> Michael Bay also often gets blamed for the Transformer who changes into a realistic human. Apparently the people blaming him for this forgot about the Pretenders from back in 1988, which had realistic human coverings, although their robot forms still transformed into vehicles. Beast Wars, however, provides a precedent for transformers having organic alternate modes.
</li><li> Skids and Mudflap are racist caricatures and that's all Bay's fault. Except for the fact that they're based on the performances of their voice actors, one of whom is black, and are intended to be the robot equivalent of "wiggas" - white boys who act like how they <em>think</em> black people act. They have a rather different characterization in the novel.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan">M.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a> didnt want to wait a year to let the show wrap up so there was a fair amount of writing in the dark. His original script that was thrown out is reported to more or less have stuck plot by plot to the show. The ghostwriter of the final script accidentally backed them into a huge corner plot wise for the rest of the series. Specifically Aang running away because he was told the avatar couldnt have kids. Zukos whole character arc depends on him being the direct descendant of an avatar.
</li><li> The studio blew most of the budget filming the opening sequence in the Southern Water Tribe (Greenland) causing the rest of the movie to be filmed inside and not look as good.
</li><li> He didnt actually want to cast white people to play Katara and Sokka. Kataras actress was cast because Paramount owed her father a favor. White Katara meant also white Sokka.
</li><li> The studio also mandated that the runtime be under 100 minutes which is what made a lot of it incoherent. The short run time was mandated because they needed to rush to get it converted to 3D in time to meet the lucrative Independence Day weekend release.

</li><li> Fans of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Agent Coulson</span> were quick to call for the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>, who is after all known for killing fan-favorites, after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> came out. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/09/15/avengers-assemble-clark-gregg-and-titus-welliver-agents-of-shield-interviewed/">Apparently, though<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, this was part of the overall MCU masterplan, and Whedon didn't get much say in it.

In reality, Whedon had been required to write the script for <em>Age</em> in isolation, to prevent the possibility of his movie spoiling the major twists of the other movies.
</li><li> Ironically enough, it was eventually revealed to fans that much of the meddling was courtesy not so much of Marvel Studios itself, but of parent company Marvel Entertainment. In fact, Marvel Studios president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinFeige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinFeige">Kevin Feige</a> got so sick of the meddling that he eventually went and convinced Disney (Marvel Entertainment's parent company) to remove Marvel Studios from Marvel Entertainment's control.

</li></ul></li><li> Film composers often get the blame and labeled with stigma for adapting a piece of classical or contemporary music into their film score. Generally during the editing stages of the film temp music is placed before the score is completed and it's common for directors and executives to "fall in love" with the temp score. And it's usually to rewrite it just enough to slip by rather than pay the extra money to license a work (for non-public domain).

This was scrapped because it was too expensive to pull off and they didn't want children climbing into fridges and getting stuck. Spielberg was also executive producer of that film.
</li></ul></li><li> Lucas also got blamed for making Soviets the main antagonists instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazis</a> like in previous films. In reality, due to the harrowing experience of making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList">Schindler's List</a></em>, Spielberg felt he could no longer depict Nazis as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">simply stock villains</a> for Indy to beat, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>'s advanced age since the last film also accounted for it.

Snyder later revealed that he had fought to keep the character's red trunks, and that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the execs</a> who wanted the character in a more modern-looking outfit to fight the perception that Superman was "lame" and "old-fashioned".

In actuality, Nolan disliked that scene and only agreed to it after pressure from both Snyder and writer David Goyer.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion">unpopular way</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> ended, people dissatisfied or disappointed with the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus">Prometheus</a></em>, which he did a rewrite on, have tended to blame Damon Lindelof for everything wrong with the film — including its vagueness, its lack of xenomorphs, the (in some people's opinion) forced comparison between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Engineers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">the Christian God</a>, etc. You name it, Lindelof's to blame.

Except that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a> came up with about half of the things that people don't like about the movie.
<ul><li> And Lindelof is now getting blamed for all of the problems on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WorldWarZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WorldWarZ">World War Z</a></em>... despite the fact that he was brought in only to do rewrites long after production started and did nothing else (directing, producing, acting) on the film. Could we have a new poster child for this trope?
</li></ul></li><li> When the 2010 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHood2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHood2010">Robin Hood</a></em> movie hit theatres, the critics were quick to blame their disappointment on the lesser-known writers Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, who were credited as authors of the "story". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">Who else</a> could have bungled it in a movie directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe">Russell Crowe</a>, and written by Brian Helgeland, the writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysticRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysticRiver">Mystic River</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LAConfidential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LAConfidential">L.A. Confidential</a></em>? In fact, Reiff and Voris' original script was a completely different story altogether, <em>Nottingham</em>, that told Robin Hood's story from the Sheriff's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip">point of view</a>. This premise was dismissed from the start by Scott, and after several rewrites there was practically nothing left of the original script (in Reiff and Voris' words, <em>a single sentence</em> of the dialogue they wrote made it into the final film, and was said by a different character).
</li><li> Whenever a new adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> is made, there's a good chance it will involve the scene in which Gulliver puts out a fire in the Lilliputian palace by urinating on it. As such there will <em>always</em> be a reviewer who claims that this is gross, crude humour and that "Jonathan Swift would be rolling in his grave!", presumably unaware that this exact scene (and more even grosser, cruder stuff) actually happened in the book.
</li><li> After the 2003 live-action version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em> was released, many filmgoers and even professional critics blamed star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMyers">Mike Myers</a> for the less than child friendly tone of the film. It was also commonly assumed that he must have rewritten the script and added all the crude jokes himself, because he had screenplay credits on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld">Wayne's World</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a></em> films. In actual fact, though, Myers had nothing to do with the screenplay, and wasn't even attached to the film for most of its development phase; he agreed to replace the original star, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen">Tim Allen</a>, as part of a legal settlement with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> after he broke his contract to star in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Sprockets</a></em> movie.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J.

</li><li> Many reviews of Paul W.S. Anderson's remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers2011">The Three Musketeers</a></em> apparently decided that because it was Anderson, any trace of the original Dumas story would be gone. Many of the reviews acted as if the story bore no resemblance to the novel at all. Well, of course some things were changed, including turning Milady into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> and the addition of airships, but honestly, the overall plot is pretty much exactly what Dumas wrote. All in all, it probably took fewer liberties than the 1993 version. Indeed, it may be the dissimilarity to the 1993 version that caused people to think Anderson's film wasn't faithful; because it wasn't faithful to the <em>significantly altered</em> version they were more familiar with.
</li><li> People who dislike the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">its sequel</a> tend to pile all of the hate and blame on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewGarfield">Andrew Garfield</a>, despite Garfield merely playing the role and not being responsible for the costume, the writing, the soundtrack, or anything that tends to be hated in particular concerning the film. Even issues people take with the characterization of Spidey tend to be things based more on how Spider-Man is written rather than how he's acted; even his <em>hair</em> (which gets a surprisingly large amount of hate) is at least partially the fault of the stylist for the film rather than him. As he is pretty much seen as the face of the new franchise, every problem with it is blamed on him, regardless of what sense it makes. And if it's not him, it's the director, even if the series' problems obviously not being all Webb's fault.
<ul><li> Some watchers claim that the reboot unnecessarily changed the web-shooters to mechanical ones instead of using the "comic-accurate" organic ones. However, comic-Spideys' web-shooters became organic only to match the changes made for the Raimi films; He had used mechanical ones for several decades by then.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> fans have blamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi">Sam Raimi</a> for the critically-divided <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> with the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Venom</a> and having Mary Jane Watson becoming the damsel in distress for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy">third time</a>. However, those ideas were actually Avi Arad's ideas, and in addition to that Raimi's ideas was to have the Vulture as the secondary villain and Gwen Stacy being the damsel in distress for the final battle, plus Raimi has considered Venom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Raimi</strong>: Its a movie that just didnt work very well. I tried to make it work, but I didnt really believe in all the characters, so that couldnt be hidden from people who loved Spider-Man. If the director doesnt love something, its wrong of them to make it when so many other people love it. I think [raising the stakes after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em>] was the thinking going into it, and I think thats what doomed us. I shouldve just stuck with the characters and the relationships and progressed them to the next step and not tried to top the bar.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> tends to receive all of the scorn of the fan base in spite of simply being a producer for the film. This tends to be par the course for anything Bay is associated with. In a somewhat ironic turn, it turns out that Bay is actually responsible for <em>nixing</em> a lot of bad ideas that others wanted to put in, since he's now fairly aware of how a fanbase will react to changes. But, due to being who he is, he ends up being blamed for a lot of the ideas <em>to which he said no</em>. Essentially, a lot of the people cursing his name should be <em>thanking</em> him for doing what they wanted!
</li><li> The "Turtles as aliens" rumours. They were eventually revealed to have <em>never</em> been an official part of the story. The rumour was based on a line which, in context, seemed to indicate that the Ooze, rather than the Turtles, would be alien in origin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A throwaway line confirmed this to still be true.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Richard Lester gets a lot of flack for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">campier</a> tone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII">Superman II</a></em> as compared to the more serious tone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em> (which was directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDonner">Richard Donner</a>). In fact, given the chaos surrounding the production of <em>Superman II</em> (including the firing of Donner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneHackman">Gene Hackman</a> walking out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> refusing the use of the footage filmed of him), the fact that Richard Lester was able to get a coherent film out at all is worthy of praise. Donner's cut of the film was released on DVD in 2006, but as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/movies/Superman_II_The_Donner_Cut_2006.aspx">this review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows, it's not as if his version of is any less campy. The blame really rests with the producers, Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who insisted on an extremely campy, humorous approach (even moreso than what we ended up getting) similar to the '60s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman</a></em> series, and replaced Donner because he wouldn't give it to them — neverminding that his vision for the first film became a critical and financial success despite their wishes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai">The Last Samurai</a></em> is often trotted out as a textbook example of why "whitewashing" is such a problem in Hollywood, since—of course—everybody knows that it's completely absurd to cast the whitebread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise">Tom Cruise</a> as "The Last Samurai". Except, if you've actually seen the movie, it should be pretty obvious that Cruise's character <em>isn't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">the titular "Last Samurai"</a>; that would be Katsumoto, who's played by the very Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenWatanabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenWatanabe">Ken Watanabe</a>. In fact, since the word "samurai" can be either singular or plural, the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaningTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaningTitle">could either refer to Katsumoto or to the band of rebel samurai that he leads</a>. While the movie could be justly accused of leaning on an unnecessary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead">White Male Lead</a> to make Asian history more accessible to Westerners, it never tries to claim that Cruise's character is a samurai. He's just a wayward American who gets some samurai training and falls in love with their way of life.
</li><li> An interesting version involving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad (2016)</a></em>: when early reviews came in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> revealed that it was given a combined total of 30% liked, fans blew up at this and started a petition in an attempt to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">shut down the website</a></em>, accusing it of creating reviews <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">to destroy</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a>. This is despite the fact that Rotten Tomatoes just <em>gathers</em> the reviews, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> has a stake in the website and the movie hadn't even been released yet.
</li><li> The MPAA have been blamed by many for neutering the gore effects in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVANewBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVANewBeginning">Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVIJasonLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVIJasonLives">Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives</a></em>. While it's true that they did insist on at least a few cuts to each of the films, they're not entirely to blame. With <em>A New Beginning</em>, Paramount actually forced a lot of cuts on the film before it ever reached the MPAA, some due to the sub-par effects, and others due to the executives feeling the kills were tasteless even by the standards of the series. <em>Jason Lives</em> was intentionally a less gory film to begin with, due to director Tom McLoughlin choosing to emphasise character, atmosphere and humor over gore. With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVIITheNewBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartVIITheNewBlood">Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood</a></em>, however... yeah, that was all on the MPAA.
</li><li> M. Night Shyamalan, already an easy target, ended up getting the brunt of the criticism for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth">After Earth</a></em>, even though by all accounts it was really Will Smith's brainchild, who essentially had complete creative control over the film. Shyamalan acted as little more than the cinematographer/director-for-hire.
</li><li> When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> fans decried <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> as a complete disappointment, one of the most common allegations against the film was that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> subjected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a> to embarrassing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> by turning him into a glorified minion of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Talia al-Ghul</span>, the real leader of the League of Shadows. While one could make a pretty good case for the twist being unnecessary and distracting, actually watching the film makes it pretty clear that the complaint about Bane being a "minion" simply isn't true. Rather, it's made clear that Bane and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thalia</span> have known each other for years, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">they're utterly devoted to each other</a>, and that they owe each other their lives—due to Bane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">allowing himself to be disfigured</a> to allow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Talia to escape from prison</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thalia</span> returning to free him from prison. Even if only one of them can officially lead the League of Shadows, there's genuine love and friendship between them, and Bane is far more than just a servant.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> trilogy got mostly positive reviews, some fans have blamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a> for many of the more controversial aspects of the film from the sloppy editing to the decision to turn what was supposed to be duology into a trilogy. In actuality, many of these decisions were mandated by Warner Bros. and New Line Films against Jackson's wishes.

</li><li> Unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017">Death Note (2017)</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> only licensed the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullmetalAlchemist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullmetalAlchemist2017">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> movies internationally, and had no involvement in their production, which was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> Japan.
</li><li> Anyone who dislikes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareBeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightmareBeach">Nightmare Beach</a> (or, Welcome to Spring Break)</em> can be pretty much counted on to consider it a low point in the distinguished career of Eurocult filmmaker Umberto Lenzi, which isn't helped by the fact that the credited director, Harry Kirkpatrick, was long believed to be an Anglicized alias of Lenzi (which happens to have not been all that uncommon in the Eurocult scene, with examples including Ruggero Deodato becoming Roger Rockefeller or Roger Franklin, Bruno Mattei becoming Vincent Dawn, Claudio Fragasso becoming Clyde Anderson, Ennio Morricone becoming Leo Nichols or Dan Savio, Gian Maria Volontè becoming John Wells, and, most infamously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone">Sergio Leone</a> becoming Bob Robertson). In truth, while Lenzi <em>was</em> originally to direct the film, a dispute led to him taking a reduced role in favor of Kirkpatrick, who had written the screenplay for the film.
</li><li> A funny case of this with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em>: the infamous scene where Mulch unhinges his jaw and starts eating dirt so fast that it starts flying out of his buttcrack was largely reported as a sign that the film was a mess, and often got brought up in the context of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay">Adaptation Decay</a>. While there was a <em>lot</em> of controversial-at-best changes made to the source material, the scene is entirely accurate to how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em>-verse dwarves were described in the books. It does strike one as a bit odd that this, of all things, was something they felt they needed to keep.

<ul><li> There was a small debacle when fans of the comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic">The Books of Magic</a></em> accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> of ripping it off. Nobody has confirmed this, and in fact, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> admitted that neither Rowling or himself were the first people who created a bespectacled young man destined to become a great wizard, or send him to school. But it got worse when a magazine said Gaiman <em>accused</em> Rowling of pinching his idea. Immediately Gaiman defended himself against the person who misblamed him and said, "I did <em>NOT</em> accuse her of that!" He even admits that if anything, they were more inspired by fantasy authors writing Arthurian legends than each other.
<ul><li> Terry Pratchett has likewise had to fend off numerous accusations that he'd ripped off J.K. Rowling with <em>Equal Rites</em>, despite the latter having been written in 1987. When he's pointed this out, some fans have turned around and misblamed him for accusing <em>Rowling</em> of stealing his work! The similarities between them mostly amount to this: there is a school for magic users, someone in the book uses a broomstick to fly. Someone is turned partially or entirely into a pig, goats are mentioned a couple times.
</li><li> An accusation also leveled at him for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy">Johnny Maxwell Trilogy</a></em> (even though the similarities pretty much begin and end with Johnny and Kirsty being similar characters to Harry and Hermione).
</li></ul></li><li> One of the complaints about the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">infamous covers</a> is that Lan is shown to have a samurai based helmet in the first book, claiming that only the Seanchan have Samurai based helmets. Actually, Lan did have a helmet just like the one on the cover of the book during the Aiel war. It was based off of the one used by the famous Samurai Date Masamune. In fact Lan's helmet was probably the most accurate thing about that cover.
</li><li> All of the books with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s" on the cover were, in fact, written by other authors, with pretty much no input on the contents of said books by Mr. Clancy himself, past laying out the setting for the various series. When people complain about Mr. Clancy's works, however, often those licensed books are cited as examples of the quality of his writing (or, specifically, lack thereof).
</li><li> Quite a few people blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> for the fact that his name is plastered all over the cover and marketing of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novels that he co-wrote with Garfield Reeves-Stevens and Judith Reeves-Stevens, and accuse him of pushing them to the sidelines for the sake of his ego. Fact of the matter is that writers have little, if any, say in the cover design of their books and the publishers did it because his name carries more weight outside of the Trek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> readership than the Reeves-Stevens do.
</li><li> Richard Knaak of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> Lore does receive some of this. While the man does certainly have weaknesses in his writing style (Mary Sues for instance) he doesn't exactly go around changing the lore as he sees fit. He does discuss things with the rest of the lore team before hand, and he does have to get their approval before he makes any major change. While he is guilty of at least a few sins, changing the lore because he feels like it isn't one of them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> Karen Traviss gets a lot of flak, most notoriously for establishing that the Grand Army Of The Republic constituted a mere three million clones. While this number is ridiculously low for a galactic scale conflict (the Eastern Front in WWII alone had somewhere around <em>15 million</em> troops), what people missed was that when Lama Su was talking about 'two hundred thousand units' being ready, he was talking about 'units of product' (and individual clones) rather than 'military units'. This was more clearly stated in the then upper-tier canon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> movie novelization, which was released in 2002. Traviss' first published work in Star Wars wasn't released until <em>2004</em>. Unfortunately, this created a substantial amount of conflict when other authors missed the higher-canon established figures, and did things like give the Separatists an army in the quintillions. The resulting flame wars were not pretty to say the least.
</li><li> If you've met a disgruntled fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, they'll probably tell you that the recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows">A Feast for Crows</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADanceWithDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADanceWithDragons">A Dance with Dragons</a></em> is evidence that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R.

While the series' rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> is no one's fault but Martin's (and he's admitted as much), the truth about the slow pace of the plot is a bit more complicated. As Martin has confirmed in multiple interviews, he knows <em>exactly</em> where the plot is going, and he has for years. The problem is that <em>Crows</em> and <em>Dragons</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">weren't even supposed to exist in his original plan for the series</a>; he wanted to have a lengthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords">A Storm of Swords</a></em> that would have set up the final climax of the series in the next books (hence, why so many major characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">die</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">leave</a> at the end of that book). When he realized that that plan wouldn't work, he had to write two new books as a bridge between the first act and the final act; if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">not much seems to happen</a> in those books, it's because they're only meant to set up the climax that Martin originally wanted to write much earlier. And yes, Martin <em>does</em> know how the series is supposed to end: he's already shared the planned ending of the series with the producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> in case they get to the ending before he does.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher">Jim Butcher</a> has been accused of sexism, relating to the long, loving descriptions of female characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. However, these descriptions are completely absent from all his other works, and simply stem from the fact that the POV character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> is a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a> with a wide and deep set of personal issues (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor">Rage Against the Mentor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> are only the tip of the iceberg).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: In-Universe with Talisa Maegyr. Judging from some of the Northern Lords' dialogues in Season 6, they blame her for Robb's defeat.
</li><li> The American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> is often accused of adding unnecessary silly humour. Ironic, since the humour in <em>Power Rangers</em> is usually far less prevalent and far less silly than in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>.
<ul><li> The best way to explain the differences between <em>Power Rangers</em> and <em>Super Sentai</em> is that <em>Rangers</em> stays in the middle whereas <em>Sentai</em> goes to <strong>BOTH</strong> extremes. Yes, it is less silly and does cut out a lot of the over-the-top cuteness of the Japanese version, but at the same time, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> seem to be less strict in Japan, they are also allowed to show blood, use guns, and have characters actually die. Oddly enough, each show is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than the other at the same time.
</li><li> Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">Bruce Kalish</a> was <em>NOT</em> responsible for the excessive explosions during his and the rest of Disney's run on the franchise. That was actually done by Koichi Sakamoto, who, in fact, has worked on the series with both Saban <em>and</em> Disney, and even does work on Japanese shows (you can see more than a few "Kalisplosions" in the Sakamoto-directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderFourze">Kamen Rider Fourze</a></em>, especially the final episode). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">But Kalish was the executive producer, and thus, everything was his fault.</a> Fans may also be willing to give Sakamoto more leeway because aside from the explosions, his style of fight direction is generally held in high regard.
<ul><li> While Bruce Kalish has passed the buck to Koichi Sakamoto on multiple occasions as Sakamoto does use similar effects work in series he directs (see: Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger on top of the above Fourze example), the problem with such blame for many fans is Sakamoto was not the main or stunt director, nor involved in choreographing scenes during Kalishs run. He hadnt done so for Power Rangers since the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Wild Force</a></em>. And during the bulk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Power Rangers Operation Overdrive</a></em>'s production (where many cite Kalishplosions being at their absolute worst), Sakamoto was busy in Japan doing second unit directorial work and stunt choreography for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Juken Sentai Gekiranger</a></em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Power Rangers Jungle Fury</a></em>'s source material), meaning he was not present or able to perform or direct the original effects work for Overdrive due to the much more demanding production schedule for Sentai. His work on Gekiranger in turn lead to his primary directorial work with Toei later on for Fourze and Kyoryuger, alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider W</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">the Ultra series over with Tsuburaya productions</a>; none of these latter cases featuring egregious overused explosions which a scene then lingers on or repeats footage of; which is one of the more prevalent criticisms of the Kalishplosion, and such was otherwise absent from his work or nowhere near the egregious degree before this period. So generally fans have given Sakamoto the benefit of the doubt over this; as his while his effect-work does use a lot of explosions, his style of fight direction remains in known for its fast, Dynamic and effective pace while not removing coherence or detracting from the narrative staging of a scene. Most of which is lacking or absent in what fans refer to as Kalishplosions. As the problem with Kalishplosions is not just the explosions, but how they are framed and utilized with respect to a scene and the story.
</li><li> Mark Harris replaced Sakamoto as stunt director at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm">Power Rangers Ninja Storm</a></em>. As what fans refer to as Kalishplosions began to appear prominently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Power Rangers Dino Thunder</a></em>, and such appeared in his later work, its likely he is the true culprit in this argument. Tellingly, Harris returned as stunt director for the Neo-Saban era, and the Kalishsplosions still continue in that era, albeit they're a lot less noticeable due to being filmed and edited differently — which has just brought the argument full-circle as to whether or not Kalish was the person ordering the explosions to be showcased much more during his era.
</li></ul></li><li> In recent years, the fact that the original Black and Yellow Rangers were played by an African-American man and an Asian-American woman has received a lot of criticism due to perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>. It should be noted, however, that the actress originally cast as the Yellow Ranger was actually Hispanic (the original pilot ended up airing some years later), and the Vietnamese-American Thuy Trang was only brought in as a replacement when said actress dropped out of the show. As for the Black Ranger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Walter Jones himself</a> has since explained that he was actually originally cast as the Blue Ranger, but the producers wanted him to switch roles so that the original Sentai footage would line up with the idea that Zack was Jason/Red's best friend; Jones was <em>asked</em> if he was okay with the change, and said "Yes" because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">he thought the suit was cooler</a>. Jones also said that the staff <strong>did</strong> realize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of the casting, but not until several episodes had already been completed, at which point it was too late to do anything about it.
<ul><li> The promotional video entitled Galaxy Rangers (which can be seen on the DVD boxset) done by Saban in 1992 as a proof of concept for Bandai (which is believed by some to be made up from footage from an attempt at making Bioman with Zyuranger footage being swapped in.) Zack (played by actor Miquel Nunez Jr.) is classified as green (on screen at least) and Trini is played by a white actress.
</li></ul></li><li> Haim Saban often gets blamed or credited (at least with the Saban eras) with anything Power Rangers despite not having much of a hand with it since 1995 and only cutting the checks nowadays. His producing partner, Shuki Levy was apparently far more guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and even then it only got really out of hand with <em>Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie</em>.
</li><li> Similarly, fans tend to blame Saban (the company, not the man) for the terrible live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> adaptation that never made it further than a brief promo video, to the point of nicknaming it <em>Saban Moon</em>. This is presumably because Saban is the best-known (and for many fans, the <em>only</em> known) company that produces and/or adapts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a> for Western audiences; the promo was made by Toon Makers, a subsidiary of Toei, the company that owned the rights to <em>Sailor Moon</em> at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>, many fans will often claim that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChourikiSentaiOhranger">Chouriki Sentai Ohranger</a></em> was the series that almost killed off the franchise, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GekisouSentaiCarranger">Gekisou Sentai Carranger</a></em> was the one that saved the franchise.

Said show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChoujinSentaiJetman">Choujin Sentai Jetman</a></em>, ended up being a <em>huge</em> hit, and as a result, Toei decided to continue making Sentai series. Fortunately, this incorrect belief seems to have started to die off.
<ul><li> In another Sentai-example, fans of <em>Power Rangers</em> will correctly blame Toei for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Samurai Sentai Shinkenger</a></em> being heavily rooted in Samurai culture...but for the wrong reasons. A rumor is that <em>Shinkenger</em> has so many aspects of Japanese culture due to Toei retaliating against Disney trying to make the Sentai footage tone down on the violence (to the point where Disney wanted an <em>animated series</em> to replace the show). However, <em>Shinkenger</em> aired during the run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em>, which was (at the time) going to be the last <em>Power Rangers</em> season, and had only happened because Disney was contractually obligated to make it (if Disney had their way, <em>Jungle Fury</em> would've been the last <em>Rangers</em> series), and Toei had no way of knowing that Saban would buy the rights back after <em>RPM</em> finished. As such, it's simply an issue of bad luck on Saban's part - <em>Shinkenger</em> finished airing before Saban bought the rights back, and even if they could've skipped <em>Shinkenger</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9k913');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9k913" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9k913');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which they couldn't; Saban's deal with Toei explicitly forbade them from skipping Sentai at the time; it's the reason why Saban had to use the comedic <em>Carranger</em> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>, despite <em>Turbo</em> planned as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a></span>, the alternative would've been to adapt <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger">Tensou Sentai Goseiger</a></em> (which, while not as heavily rooted in Japanese culture, still had some aspects of Japanese culture, not to mention that it had a religious theme), so it was a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation in regards to adapting <em>Shinkenger</em> (as <em>Shinkenger</em> was very well-received in the west, in part due to fans watching it since no <em>Rangers</em> adaptation was made by Disney, whereas <em>Goseiger</em>...wasn't; if Saban <em>had</em> been able to skip <em>Shinkenger</em> and done so, jumping to <em>Goseiger</em>, odds are fans would've complained about the former getting skipped, as evident by the complaints fans had when (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers">at the time</a>) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters">Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters</a></em> was skipped in favor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger</a></em>).
</li></ul></li><li> The poorly received third season of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> was largely blamed on the showrunner Fred Freiberger. But most of the cast and crew have worked to denounce that idea because of several major reasons. First, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> had left the writing duties in the third season, he (the creator) only had a minor influence on the show. Second, Gene Roddenberry left because the network promised a juicy Monday night spot, only to renounce it and give them the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot">Friday Night Death Slot</a>. Third, the production budget was always below par for a sci-fi series, and the budget was slashed another 10 percent, which affected the scripts heavily. Freiberger was doing his best on a show that was sinking fast. If anything the main culprits were script editor Arthur Singer and network executive Douglas S. Cramer, the former of whom knew virtually nothing about the show and made little attempt to find out during the season, and the latter of whom apparently vetoed several good story ideas and pushed for the show to have a campier overall tone (one of his demands in particular was having the script for "The Way to Eden" changed to incorporate childish pot shots aimed at his predecessor, Herbert Solow).
<ul><li> In regards to Rick Berman and Brannon Braga's control of the franchise in later years, fans seem to often believe that they had complete control over it even above Paramount Productions. They were actually not immune from any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and were given demands that have compromised the various shows. This shows primarily in the TNG-esque nature of <em>Voyager</em>, which had started off fairly unique unto itself. But with <em>Deep Space Nine</em> underperforming in ratings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> demanded that the more TNG-like Voyager stay with the TNG formula. Those demands largely hurt the morale at the show; Ronald Moore said it was extremely depressing being in the writers room.
</li><li> Additionally, some seem to be under the delusion that Brannon Braga was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Showrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Showrunner">showrunner</a> for the entire run of <em>Voyager</em>, and so lay the blame for the show's quality at his feet. In actual fact, he was only the showrunner on two out of the show's seven seasons — Jeri Taylor was the main showrunner for most of the show's history, and in an odd inversion of the trope, receives virtually no blame from the fans but quite a bit from the other writers who worked on the show. On the other hand, Braga <strong>was</strong> the showrunner for all but one season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, so he has more to answer for on that count.
</li><li> Some fans blame Ronald D. Moore for turning the Klingons into thuggish, honor obsessed warriors during the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. In actuality, that had already been done by then-showrunner Maurice Hurley during the first season, two years before Moore started working on the show. If anything, Moore actually <em>toned down</em> the TNG-era Klingons from their first few appearances, where they were depicted almost as animalistic savages; in their latter appearances they were again depicted with the more cunning and ruthless nature displayed in the TOS era, albeit still with the Vikings-in-Space angle that Hurley had introduced.
<ul><li> If anything, the blame goes back even further, to their portrayal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>, which took the newer, more animalistic look, viking-like armor and dark ship interiors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> and ran with it, having the Klingons growl at each other and behave as pirates, both in attitude and action. So, more so than Hurley, Harve Bennett deserves blame for starting the trend.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> fans have a tendency to find one particular behind-the-scenes figure — John Nathan-Turner, Michael Grade, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>, etc — and blame absolutely everything they don't like on that figure, regardless of whether they can be reasonably blamed or not.
<ul><li> The low quality of seasons 21-23 of <em>Doctor Who</em>'s original run was for a long time blamed on Colin Baker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartofGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartofGold">performance</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Sixth Doctor</a>. After his surprisingly good performances in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BigFinish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BigFinish">Big Finish</a></em> audio plays, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">largely cleared his name</a>, leading fans to look to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">other scapegoats</a>.
</li><li> When Freema Agyeman (Martha Jones) left after the third series of the revived show, some fans insisted she had either been fired or pressured to leave because the producers felt she could not live up to her extremely popular predecessor, Billie Piper (it didn't help that onscreen Martha left the Doctor for this reason.) This was denied by all involved, but it still pops up occasionally as a conspiracy theory in the fandom. It's possible that she had only signed on for one series.
</li><li> Christopher Eccleston appeared to have left for reasons similar to the above (on top of the hectic shooting schedule); there has been no definitive proof that the 40-something actor left after one series due to being "typecast". Eccleston has also been quoted as being dissatisfied with how some of the directors mistreated the other crew during long shoots as why he wasn't involved in the 50th anniversary show. When his autobiography was released in 2019, it was clarified that he also had a falling-out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> and was battling anorexia and depression.
</li><li> Martha had also fallen victim to a Type 3: her character has received criticism for not being confident enough in herself (particularly in her unrequited feelings for the Doctor), and not being convincing as a professional adult. This seems to be based on a misconception by US viewers about the character's intended age: medical students in Britain start studying at age 18, so Martha could well be a teenager, and cannot be any older than 22 or so. There's no in-story reason for her to be particularly world-wise.
</li><li> Steven Moffatt often gets blamed for casting a woman to play the Doctor by those who disagree with the idea of a female Doctor. The idea to cast Jodie Whitaker as the Thirteenth Doctor was done by his successor, Chris Chibnal, though Moffatt did lay a lot of the groundwork by canonising the idea of cross sex regenerations. On a related note, the idea of a female Doctor has been around as long as regeneration and it was supported by Sydney Newman, one of the shows original producers. Ironically, during his tenure Moffat often got plenty of stick from people on the other side of the line for <em>not</em> casting a female Doctor when he had the opportunity.
</li></ul></li><li> The regrettable murder storyline from the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights">Friday Night Lights</a></em> was such a huge departure from season one's low key, realistic tone that everyone was sure it was all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> trying to get the show's middling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings">ratings</a> up. Turns out, it was entirely the idea of the show's producers. However, NBC really didn't help with all their commercials focusing on the storyline, showing an incredibly misunderstanding of what the show's fans wanted to see.
<ul><li> Or they assumed that the show's fans would be watching anyway, but that promoting the murder storyline would bring in people who had previously not watched much of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em> is full of these. First off, despite what some more aggressive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> fans may tell you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> did <em>not</em> invent the idea of a modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> adaptation, and the concept had been around for decades (it goes back to the 1940s Universal films with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasilRathbone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasilRathbone">Basil Rathbone</a>, which had Holmes battling Nazi spies). As for the criticism about making Watson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Asian</a>, it was not meant to "pander" to minority viewers; the creators are on record saying the part was race-neutral, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucyLiu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucyLiu">Lucy Liu</a> just happened to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityOverAppearance">the best actress for the job</a>.
<ul><li> Some people have even complained about Sherlock's "fake-sounding" accent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonnyLeeMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonnyLeeMiller">Jonny Lee Miller</a> is actually English, he just doesn't sound like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>. The complaint seems to be due to the misconception that all English people have the same accent, despite the fact that there are just as many variations as one would find in American English.
</li></ul></li><li> Every single cast change in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> (quite a few, as by the end the entire original cast was gone) was blamed on Jim Mallon, who the fans portrayed as a tyrant imposing his will on everyone else involved with the show. This even happened with the departure of Joel Hodgson, who not only had the same level of creative control as Mallon but created the show in the first place, so no one could make him leave if he didn't want to. There had been some behind the scenes friction between the two men that ultimately led to Joel's departure, but much of this has been blown out of proportion by the fanbase and Joel himself has had to play damage control more than a few times.
</li><li> Pretty much anything that went wrong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> is blamed on Fox, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Joss Whedon himself</a> takes credit for such things as drastic changes or <a class="urllink" href="http://whedonesque.com/comments/17005">shooting a new pilot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Granted, it's hard to blame the fans. Fox <em>did</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect">cancel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, which was definitely a high-quality show that got screwed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. But it's like Whedonites have a constant persecution complex up and running — All. The. Time.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a> is the perfect example of the above-mentioned phenomenon where a popular show gets cancelled because the "wrong" audience liked it. Quoth the producer: "The initial results  they made the network nervous. The men didnt respond as strongly as they thought they would, and the women responded more strongly."
</li></ul></li><li> Nikki and Paolo are universally despised by most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> fans for their sudden introduction, questionable relevance to the main plot and the false pretense to "have been here all along". Yet the reason the characters were created in the first place is because fans themselves often asked about the stories of the random extras seen carrying wood or something while main characters were discussing important stuff. They didn't use the actors who had actually been seen in the background earlier in the series because they <em>were</em> extras, and thus couldn't be expected to hold up when moved into more major roles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife">My So-Called Life</a></em> fans tend to blame the show's one-season run on either a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> or b) Claire Danes (who was, it's worth pointing out, all of 16) being a prima donna and refusing to sign for a second season. The producer statements have been ambiguous, but the most likely interpretation is that the network didn't offer a renewal until Claire had other commitments that she didn't want to back out of, and the producers threw up their hands rather than try to negotiate.
</li><li> Fans of the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> seemed to have blamed that the recent eviction of Jeff was somehow the producer's fault. Sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> has been the most likely culprit for several game-changing instances, but there was clearly no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, obvious case of misblame there. Why would CBS meddle in a ratings dog? (The viewers literally dropped by <em>half</em> after his eviction.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">hatedom</a> will sometimes blame him for the quality of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em> (see, for example, the final paragraphs of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/starwars-holiday/page3.php">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). The fact is, Lucas wrote up a basic story outline, and left CBS to finish it while he worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>. Without Lucas' involvement, the producers rewrote much of the original script, turning it into the 70s-variety-show schlock-fest that we all love to hate. It appears that contractual obligations were the only reason that Lucas allowed the finished product to air, and he has gone on record saying that he wants to <em>destroy</em> every copy of the Holiday Special.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>: Children of Earth</em>, Ianto's character arc involved him beginning to accept his bisexuality and come out to his family about his relationship with Jack — then he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">suddenly and unexpectedly killed off.</a></span> Many fans were <em>not</em> happy, and blamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> (despite the fact that he is openly gay and has introduced a variety of LGBT characters on both <em>Torchwood</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em>.) He denied that sexuality had anything to do with it, and insisted Ianto was just "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">defeated by a greater evil</a>" for plot purposes. Some people then turned their ire towards writer James Moran, who has also stated that there was no malicious intent behind the decision. It's worth noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a> is very much an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">Everyone Is Bi</a>.

</li><li> The mess between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno">Jay Leno</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> was mostly caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>, particularly from Jeff Zucker. The court of public opinion has ruled that it's all Leno's fault and that he was trying to horn in on Conan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">Tonight Show</a></em> because he's a selfish slimeball. True, maybe he shouldn't have accepted NBC's offer to move back to 11:35, but basically everything that is attributed to Leno was really done by Zucker. (And the quality of Leno's humor is subjective and is honestly irrelevant to the debate.)
<ul><li> It has also been suggested that Conan was himself complicit in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that saw Leno leave <em>The Tonight Show</em> and him takeover in the first place.
</li><li> O'Brien's contract stipulated that he would become the host of the show within a set period of time. Leno never wanted to leave, and any statements to the contrary were required of him by the studio. To rub it in even further, Conan's TBS show now does a third of what Leno does on <em>Tonight</em> in the ratings.
</li><li> Conan was going to be screwed either way. Leno could've declined, and got himself and his staff fired along with Conan's, or accepted and saved the jobs of all the people working on the Tonight Show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> fans who blame the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">scrappiness</a> of certain characters on the actors who portray them.
<ul><li> Poor Dania Ramirez, who played Maya, is probably the all time example of this. Yes, Maya was annoying, but Dania Ramirez did not write or direct the 11,000 scenes in which her character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy">cried</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">screamed for her brother</a>, and/or acted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">useless</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, Mohinder's actor Sendhil Ramamurthy has been <em>incredibly</em> snarky about his own character's permanent possession of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> during some episode commentaries, to the point where it's pretty obvious he only WISHES he had control over the scripts. In fact, Mohinder's storyline would probably get a lot more entertaining if he did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> was also a victim of extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> by NBC (not to mention the writer's strike).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda">Alan Alda</a> often gets blamed for a lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">Strawman Political</a> regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>. Series creator Larry Gelbart, however, pointed out more than a few times that the series had been greenlit when no one really knew what it was supposed to be, and Alda was the only one really willing to come forward with any ideas.
</li><li> Arguably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em> qualifies as an inversion of type 1 (not that the show had no flaws, just that it's the successors that had the flaws generally associated with the work) mixed with type 2. It is usually blamed by people (especially on the Internet) for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>'s current batch of low budget <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> shows with over the top humor, wacky plots, weird premises, and laugh tracks, despite the fact that it really had none of those (Lizzie was supposed to be a normal girl, albeit one with a cartoon avatar, there wasn't a laugh track, and the show didn't look particularly cheap) and wasn't even made by the same production company. This may be because the success of the show that really promoted Disney Channel to the forefront in the young female demographic.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BionicWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BionicWoman">Bionic Woman</a></em> reboot in 2007 has had executive meddling or low ratings are usually blamed for the cancellation of the show. But it was the Writer's Strike that halted production. Had it not been for the strike, it's likely the show would have had a full first season at the least.
<ul><li> The Writer's Strike resulted in a lot of problems. Fledgling shows went months without new episodes and lost what momentum they built, and some shows had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">storylines cut short</a>. It's also the reason why Transformers: Rise of the Fallen was below standards. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> had to write most of the movie himself or it would have gotten shut down. He even admits that's why the movie sucks.

However, as West is quick to point out, the show was <em>far less</em> ridiculous and campy than most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> <em>Batman</em> comics that were being published at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> gets blamed for <em>everything</em> that people don't like about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, despite having almost no involvement in the writing or the production of the show. Perhaps the most egregious example of this was fans blaming Whedon for the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Antoine Triplett</span>, citing it as yet "another" example of Whedon's problems with black men; in fact, the character's death came about because the actor had other commitments that had already impacted his ability to regularly appear on <em>SHIELD</em>. Of course, this mis-blame can also sometimes work in Whedon's favor - fans tend to erroneously credit him for everything they <em>like</em> about the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianFellowes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianFellowes">Julian Fellowes</a> got a lot of hate from fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing off Sybil Crawley</span> but that idea came from actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBrownFindlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBrownFindlay">Jessica Brown Findlay</a>, who wanted to leave the show and not return in any later seasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> got all the blame from fans for canceling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGetDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGetDown">The Get Down</a></em>, with some fans essentially claiming the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a> (and some fans further claiming that it's because of the mostly African-American and Latin-American cast). While that may be part of the reason, this ignores other factors such as the show's high cost (at least $120 million, making it one of the most expensive TV shows <em>ever</em>), relatively low ratings, and the showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s commitments to other movies.
</li><li> Some people wrongfully accused Netflix or Bill Nye himself of censoring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BillNyeTheScienceGuy">Bill Nye the Science Guy</a></em> by editing out a segment about sex chromosomes. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/netflix-bill-nye-the-science-guy-censorship-1201837460/">The edit was actually made in 2007 when Buena Vista decided to sell 31 of the episodes on iTunes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and cut out many segments they couldn't get the music or talent rights to. The actress in that segment couldn't be found, so it was cut.
</li><li> After it was announced that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> character Rana Habeeb would be killed on her wedding day, many viewers took the show's producers to task for pulling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">Bury Your Gays</a> card. In reality, Rana's actress, Bhavna Limbachia had decided to leave the show and specifically requested that the character be killed off. That being said, it <em>was</em> the decision of the show's writers to have her die on her wedding day, which many felt to be a pointlessly cruel twist.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> For years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno">Yoko Ono</a>'s been blamed for causing the break-up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, when it's largely clear that internal band tensions (which would be not entirely unreasonable given that the four members of the band had essentially spent almost the entire 1960s pretty much trapped together) and increasingly diverging musical interests and pursuits would have probably done the job sooner or later no matter who John Lennon decided to get romantically involved with. It is fair to say that her increased presence in the studio was annoying to the other three Beatles, recordings having previously been a 'no girlfriends' zone, and by all accounts she didn't exactly make much of an effort to make friends, none of which exactly helped matters; but even they acknowledge that she probably doesn't deserve all the stick that she gets.
<ul><li> Not sure about the others, but it's worth noting that as early as 1971, George Harrison said publicly (on the Dick Cavett show) that Yoko was being misblamed, and that the Beatles broke themselves up. Not that it made much difference...
</li><li> Honestly, at this point, most people understand that Yoko contributed very little, if anything, to the Beatles' breakup. She does, however, still get blamed for the general weirdness that was her and John Lennon's marriage, despite a ton of evidence that John was at least as odd as she was well before meeting her.
</li><li> The Beatles also feature an inversion of this trope. Owing to the oft-expressed truism that John Lennon was the "creative" Beatle and Paul McCartney was the "fluffy" Beatle, people tend to credit all the "deep" and "important" stuff that the Beatles did to Lennon, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em>. In fact, from about late-1966 onwards McCartney was the creative powerhouse of the Beatles, as he was the one coming up with all the ideas; Lennon, although he certainly wrote some fantastic songs during this time, spend most of the period drifting away from the Beatles and getting deeper into drugs, which in general sapped his creative instincts.
</li><li> Linda McCartney has also gotten her share of mis-directed blame for breaking up the Beatles too.
</li><li> Additionally, the Beatles were horrible businessmen. They opened the Apple Boutique in London in December 1967 to support the arts and sell Beatles-related products, and it closed seven months later in July 1968 due to rampant thefts and bad business. Among other things, shoplifting occurred on a daily business with employees stealing directly from the stock. The Beatles-founded Apple Records has had its own share of business problems throughout their history, including a decades-long useless feud with Apple Computer/Apple, Inc. over issues where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a> and Apple added sound capabilities to their computers and began to sell music through iTunes, which they felt was Apple homing in on their territory. One could even claim that the end of the Beatles started when manager Brian Epstein died of an overdose, leaving the Beatles directionless. Without a strong manager, the group imploded with squabbling and arguing over what direction to take.
</li><li> In an example unrelated to their breakup, all four Beatles have at various points griped about the phenomenon of "Beatlemania" and how they quickly seemed to become an excuse for people to go utterly mad, cause chaos and/or smash things up (the obvious example being the fans losing control and becoming hysterical at their mere presence, but on several occasions police would use this as a reason to apply excessive force in controlling the crowds) and then somehow blame them for all the trouble that was caused.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gackt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gackt">Gackt</a> and/or Malice Mizer fans tend to treat Gackt's departure from MM as Mana's fault. Public opinion often portrays Mana as a wicked schemer who didn't like Gackt's behavior for some reason, so he began forcing him away from the band, and then literally kicked Gackt out. It's usually come from one of Gackts misquotes saying ?I was asked to leave Malice Mizer?. Gackt really meant that Mana asked him whether he still wanted to stay in the band and said that if he didn't nobody would stand on his way. Gackt himself admitted later on that he saw MM as a temporary jump-start project and he had always wanted to pursue a solo career. He was, in fact, dinterested in MM because he loved classical music since childhood but he never was into VK, EGL, EGA and other gothic stuff. Mana, on the other hand, thought that Gackt was the best suitable for MM and the band wouldn't be the same without him. That explains why Mana couldn't find a new vocalist for 2 year until he briefly recruited Klaha whose mannerisms and appearance were almost identical to Gackt's. Then he just disbanded Malice Mizer to form Moi Dix Moi which fairly wasn't too much different from MM.
<ul><li> It gets worse from there. Mana's reputation as not just a schemer, but also an arrogant, sadistic and jealous primadonna who can't stand anyone more popular or talented than him, has stuck. He now gets blamed by a significant number of people every time someone he works with leaves or a band on his label splits up. Admittedly, Moi Dix Mois' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighTurnoverRate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighTurnoverRate">High Turnover Rate</a>, as well as Mana's stoic and emotionless public image doesn't help, but it really has gone too far. The really sad thing is that half the people who believe it don't even listen to Malice Mizer or Moi Dix Mois, and only think Mana's to blame for everything because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaNon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaNon">everyone else in whichever Jrock community they belong to treats it as fact.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The opposite happened with reactions on La:Sadie's disbanding when almost every time Kisaki was solemnly blamed. Most typical reason is "the band wanted to go major while Kisaki wanted to stay indies". Which doesn't make sense because Kisaki was never against becoming major and his later activities kind of prove it. Every band he's been involved ever since was significantly more major than the previous one. Up the last band Phantasmagoria which was a living definition of majorism and him founding his own major record company Undercode Productions. Now he said he's retiring to focus on producing (producing = promoting various indies band to majors; Undercode had done dozen of these already). So the more legit reasons are Kaoru's lead persona and the fact that the band met Toshiya from D+ L on a joint concert and liked him so much, that they "stole" him.
</li><li> The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarcBolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarcBolan">T. Rex</a>'s "Get It On" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">released stateside</a> as "Bang a Gong" is often held up as an example of American prudishness, when the truth is almost the exact opposite: there was <em>already</em> a song by the jazz-fusion group Chase entitled "Get It On" on the American charts.
</li><li> Sammy Hagar tends to get flack from former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a> fans regarding the group's switch to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballad</a> sound after he joined. In fact, Eddie Van Halen was already moving in this direction before (and was a considerable factor behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a> quitting the band).
<ul><li> Additionally, the band has famously often been blamed for the damage to the Colorado State University-Pueblo's basketball arena, supposedly because Roth threw a fit over discovering brown M&amp;Ms despite the band's rider explicitly saying that their candy bowl was not to have any. While the band <em>did</em> vandalize the backstage area in anger, what actually caused most of the damage was the fact venue management had not read the rider properly—and thus had failed to realize the venue didn't meet the requirements to handle Van Halen's immensely heavy setup. So when they put everything together, it went <em>through the floor</em>. The M&amp;M clause had been put in as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> after the band had gone through similar incidents previously (the thinking being that if the venue missed the candy clause, they hadn't really paid attention to the rider, so the band would at least know they were careless), which was why Roth lost his temper.
</li></ul></li><li> Every time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> does something that displeases the fans, there are always three camps placing blame for it on either Vince Neil (for being a prima donna), Nikki Sixx (for being a control freak), or Tommy Lee (for being kind of an idiot). Mick Mars seems to have some kind of mystical immunity to this effect.
</li><li> There are two different versions of the photo collage on the back cover of the original 1967 vinyl edition of <em>Headquarters</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>: one where the center picture shows the album's producer and a recording engineer, and the other showing the Monkees with facial hair. When new generations of Monkees fans rediscovered the album, they assumed the bearded Monkees pic was the original, but the record label was afraid people would complain about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">teen idols no longer being clean-cut</a>, so they substituted it with the other. In fact, it was the other way around: the producer-engineer pic was the original, but the caption mis-identified the engineer, so they replaced it with the bearded Monkees.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> fans blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> for the band's shift away from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> to pop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Collins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">is on record</a> as saying that the shift occurred because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeAndTheMechanics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeAndTheMechanics">Mike Rutherford</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TonyBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TonyBanks">Tony Banks</a> saw the solo success he was having and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">wanted a piece of that as well</a>. Collins said on his (now defunct) official forum that (paraphrasing from memory) "I'd like to see someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule">convince Tony Banks</a> to do something he doesn't want to do!".
<ul><li> Also according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, as the band were shifted from a five-piece to a four-piece to a trio, the band were attempting to avoid the fights over writing credits and creative input they were facing with the departures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveHackett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveHackett">Steve Hackett</a> by crediting the entire band with all the songs on each album. They credited individual writers by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ATrickOfTheTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ATrickOfTheTail">A Trick of the Tail</a></em> to deflect accusations that Gabriel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">the sole visionary</a> behind the group's music, which led to the inter-group squabbles (Hackett in particular) they tried so hard to avoid. The band decided to come in the studio with no pre-written material and write collectively in the studio. They also discovered that a great deal of magic came with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">group improvisations</a>, and that by shortening the group compositions they could get more of a variety of styles. They were also, by 1981, equipped with their own recording facility (Fisher Lane Farms), and were interested in reinventing their sound for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, producing their own music along with engineer Hugh Padgham. What came out of these circumstances was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">Abacab</a></em> and the music they came up with since then. The results of having commercial success with their new sound and approach was simply icing on the cake.
</li><li> On a similar note, Banks is often blamed for the creative conflicts that led to the departure of Gabriel and Hackett, down to excluding Gabriel from the songwriting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLambLiesDownOnBroadway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLambLiesDownOnBroadway">The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</a></em> and passive-aggressively mixing Hackett out of the band's second live album <em>Seconds Out</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10yeqc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10yeqc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10yeqc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> quip from Banks that Hackett himself has denied ever actually happened</span>. This of course ignores Gabriel's problems with his wife and daughter around the same time (although he did end up writing the lyrics and overall story of the album) and the fact that the Banks/Collins/Rutherford trio had already gelled into the main creative force in the band. In fact, the band started crediting individual writers for each song in order to escape the notion that Gabriel wrote everything.
</li><li> Genesis also, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, began as a "songwriting collective", then became a band when they could find no one else willing to sing their material. They had tried to write pop songs on their first album, but failed to get success. They moved into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> direction from their second album, <em>Trespass</em>, especially as it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">easier for sheltered, upper middle class private school-educated Britons</a> to write fantasy lyrics over love songs, but they occasionally dabbled in their own brand of pop ever since with songs like "I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)", "Counting Out Time" and "Your Own Special Way". They hadn't intended to be strictly progressive rock, but most of their material fell into that style until they learned to write more commercially and gained success from it.
</li></ul></li><li> Mike Love is blamed by many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> fans for the non-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile">Smile</a></em> in 1967. While Mike can be hated for a lot of reasons (look up his acceptance speech at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RockAndRollHallOfFame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RockAndRollHallOfFame">Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a> on behalf of the Beach Boys), this is not solely his fault. It was actually a combination of a royalties lawsuit against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CapitolRecords">Capitol Records</a> filed by the Beach Boys, Van Dyke Parks leaving, Brian Wilson's mental problems and the beginning of his drug problems, and a lack of support from other members (including Mike).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LizPhair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LizPhair">Liz Phair</a> has gained some infamy in the music industry for "selling out". Despite what some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">fans</a> choose to believe, it wasn't Liz's fault. Her indie record label Matador Records dumped her onto the major Capitol Records. They wouldn't give her money to record an album unless she worked with mainstream producers and made a pop album. If Matador Records didn't give Liz away, then she most likely would have continued on her indie rock route. Additionally, Phair has said that she wasn't forced into making the album and willingly went along with Capitol's suggestion, because she thought it would be an interesting experiment for her to write and record mainstream pop music.
</li><li> Rebecca Black's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friday">Friday</a>" was an autotuned single produced on a budget of a few thousand bucks and was posted on Youtube. It soon went viral, mostly from people pointing and laughing, metaphorically speaking. A certain imgboard began to troll her, including death threats and posting her school schedule online. Yet <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/#!5783433/the-internet-made-rebecca-black-cry">when she went on Good Morning America talking about how hurt she was<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a lot of people blamed her parents and the video production company, instead of <em>the people doing the actual trolling</em>. (Compare to the tone of Gawker's own <a class="urllink" href="http://tv.gawker.com/#!5781411/is-this-the-worst-music-video-ever">earlier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/#!5783222/whats-4chan-going-to-do-to-rebecca-black">posts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which were much less sympathetic.) Also, she apparently doesn't get to complain because the single is selling very well and she's rich now.
<ul><li> Also, she is perceived as in it for the money or something or doing this on purpose, but actually she's just the one video that got lucky and had enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> views to get famous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> itself, is full of girls with decent singing voices who want/have record deals and film low budget music videos.
</li><li> The way some people bash the song and her make it obvious they think Black's the one who wrote the song; she just sang it. It was written by two grown-ass men, Clarence Jey and Patrice Wilson, who are record producers, songwriters, and otherwise professionally associated with the music industry. Black was just your average American teenager who, as stated previously, just happened to hit it big (though probably not in the way she wanted). On a general note, it's depressing how many people online think it's okay to harass people just because they're rich and successful (or they perceive them to be) or because they've landed a dream job (even if it turns out to be not so great), especially if they're young like Black.

Those who don't like this period sometimes blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryRollins">Henry Rollins</a> for the change (or at least the "heavy metal" aspect of it). While Rollins was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Face of the Band</a> at the time and contributed to the songwriting process, founding member Greg Ginn was still writing most of the band's music, and he was mainly the one behind their change in direction. In fact he said part of the reason Rollins was hired as a singer was because he wasn't solely interested in singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcorePunk">Hardcore Punk</a> songs. That said, Ginn <em>did</em> lament that ever since Rollins joined they had to consistently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">keep things dark and edgy</a> lyrically.
</li><li> Everyone knows that the bass on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>'s <em>...And Justice for All</em> album is almost non-existent. It's been believed pretty much since the album was released that new bassist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonNewsted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonNewsted">Jason Newsted</a>'s parts were deliberately buried in the mix by the surviving members as a way of hazing Newsted. However, when Newsted appeared on the first 2013 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMetalShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMetalShow">That Metal Show</a></em> and that was brought up, he admitted that a lot of the blame actually falls on him. He said that he recorded his parts by himself with no input from anyone else, using the same equipment, bass, and engineers that he used in his former band Flotsam and Jetsam. Also, since he wrote the music in F&amp;J and the guitarists took their cues from him, his bass parts on <em>Justice</em> were too much like a rhythm guitar, and ended up clashing both note-wise and sonically with Hetfield's actual rhythm guitar parts.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em>Metallica</em>, people who dislike <em>Lulu</em> blame the band for that album...despite the fact that the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a> was the one in charge of that area—while Reed has released a lot of acclaimed work as a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground">Velvet Underground</a>, he also released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalMachineMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetalMachineMusic">Metal Machine Music</a></em>, so it's entirely possible that Lou made this album to be a troll.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> are often criticized for their use of synthesizers, sequencers, drum machines, etc. in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, and de-emphasis of their progressive hard rock elements, after many years of releasing albums with a "No Synths!" disclaimer in the liner notes and adopting a very guitar-centered sound. In reality, Queen never opposed synthesizers and were always open-minded to them, but didn't feel that the synths of the time could produce the sounds they wanted to hear. They also felt they wanted to use Brian May's "guitar orchestra" multitracking techniques more in the studio, and only placed the "no synths" disclaimers after reading one too many comments mistaking Brian's guitar (and the band's general wizardry in the studio) for synthesizers. As Queen wanted to move their sound forward and felt inspired by the technology of the day, they decided to incorporate it into their music while still keeping it in the Queen style.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devourment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devourment">Devourment</a> released <em>Conceived in Sewage</em>, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">New Sound Album</a> that skewed more towards NYDM and proto-slam than their established slam death metal sound, a lot of fans angered by the change in sound blamed Relapse Records and Erik Rutan (who produced the album) for pushing them towards a "lighter", more marketable sound. In reality, neither claim was accurate. Most of the album had been written for years and hadn't been recorded largely because they desperately wanted off of Brutal Bands, and Majewski had expressed a desire as early as 2010 to expand his vocal range and move into more varied territory, as they had grown sick of playing pure slam and wanted to broaden and introduce some variation to their sound. Relapse had absolutely no say in what they did with their sound and Rutan's input was largely restricted to how they played various riffs; the rest was all them.
</li><li> Around the tail end of the 1980s, Mike Gonzalez of Dark Angel was arrested while on tour in Germany because he supposedly vandalized a police cruiser. He actually wasn't responsible, however; according to Eric Meyer, the real culprits were several members of their crew, and Gonzalez was arrested because he was the only one with a passport and thus an easier scapegoat.

The actual <em>reason</em> the tour went so poorly is because the technician they hired was wildly incompetent: Barely tuning the band's gear or not tuning it at all, and technical issues were so common it permanently colored the view of the band for years. They've since re-hired their techs, and undergo significant preparations before every tour to ensure it doesn't happen again.

<ul><li> A lot of pinball fans, especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames">Bally-Williams</a> fans, blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern">Stern</a> for causing pinball to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> through the 00s and dragging it from an American icon into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity">Mainstream Obscurity</a>. While Stern is not entirely blameless (there is no one to blame but themselves for shoddy manufacturing and often rushed production), the stagnancy that occurred during this decade was largely the fallout of a patent war during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNineties">the previous decade</a> between Bally-Williams, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gottlieb">Gottlieb</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA">SEGA</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope">collectively patented everything they could get away with to stymie their competitors</a>, then left the pinball business still holding onto those patents. The result was that Stern, the only pinball company to survive the decade, was left with next to nothing they could use that wasn't some universal un-patentable thing, like flippers. These patents finally started expiring around 2009, which also happens to be the year that Stern started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> with their machines becoming less bland and more varied. The upturn in quality is also sometimes attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball">Jersey Jack Pinball</a> popping up as competition, meaning Stern no longer had a monopoly, but that didn't happen until 2011.

<ul><li> In general, because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> heavy nature of the proceedings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> does it best to obfuscate who exactly is to blame for what on and offscreen. It's not entirely the fans' fault if they criticize the on-screen culprit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a> situation, when the actual people behind the scenes have done their damndest to confuse the issue.
</li><li> When Vincent J McMahon Sr's proposed deal about bringing the WWWF back into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> failed, people were quick to lay the blame on the feet of perennial NWA World Heavyweight Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LouThesz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LouThesz">Lou Thesz</a> and spread rumors about exactly how he killed the deal. After kayfabe was effectively dead and he had retired, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino">Bruno Sammartino</a> came to Thesz's defense, revealing that the deal required Sammartino become World Heavyweight Champion and saying he didn't want the belt unless he'd be given Sundays off so he could see his family.
</li><li> People tend to blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>(Jr) for everything bad in the WWE; while it is true that he has final say on what goes on TV a lot of the more controversial angles where others were the idea of other people working for the company (for example, the infamous Katie Vick angle was the brainchild of executive producer Kevin Dunn, though Vince has defended it pretty strongly and gladly taken "responsibility" for it in interviews, confusing the issue).
<ul><li> This is especially true for 93-94 at which time Vince had actually taken a leave of absence for legal reasons and the company was being run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PatPatterson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PatPatterson">Pat Patterson</a>.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> made sure to mention, some of it belongs on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cagematch.net/?id=93&amp;nr=886">"his idiotic daughter and his doofus son-in-law and the rest of his stupid family. "<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Many critics also don't consider just how much responsibility the TV networks themselves have, since Vince pretty much has to answer to them. This is particularly true for everyone who complains about WWE's more sanitized, PG-rated, predictible programming nowadays; given that a lot of the more controversial stuff that DID get on the air in the late 90s was always getting Vince in hot water with studio heads (USA president Kay Koplovitz threatened to kick Raw off the air on a standards &amp; practices violation after the infamous "Pillman's Got a Gun" episode), it's not unreasonable to suggest any choices to not take chances today is to appease those who ultimately decide if WWE is allowed to be on the air at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> tends to be blamed for holding people back and not jobbing cleanly, and indeed he has used his pull and fame more than a few times for personal gain or vendettas (like getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> to fire color commentator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura">Jesse Ventura</a>). However, he was never a booker and even though he had creative control, he did not decide on the angles that didn't concern him. Management is to blame for most of the mishandling of people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman">Billy Kidman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger">Lex Luger</a>. One particularly egregious example of him being misblamed is for the botched ending of his match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> at <em>Starrcade 1997</em>. Several people to this day claim that Hogan bribed Nick Patrick to intentionally count at regular speed, to make Sting look bad when he kicked out when he was supposed to (after "three"). There is no real evidence that Patrick didn't just make a mistake, other than general rumors of Hogan's backstage behaviors.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> has said in multiple places (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>'s podcast and Conrad Thompson's 83 Weeks podcast) that <strong>he</strong> booked the controversial Starrcade 1997 finish. Sting showed up on the day of the event pale, out of shape and unenthusiastic (Sting was struggling with substance abuse and marital problems unbeknownst to Bischoff at that time) and Bischoff panicked. He shortened the match and changed the finish a few hours before showtime. Bischoff is adamant that Hogan lobbied for the original finish to put Sting over clean because of the year-plus that had been put into the build. As for the pacing of the count, Nick Patrick said he simply forgot about the change to the match and counted regularly.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">Montreal Screwjob</a> was such a chaotic situation, and kayfabe and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">worked shoots</a> have further muddied the issue until a lot of people are <em>badly</em> misinformed about what actually happened. That being said. Triple H was not a major contributor to the Montreal Screwjob, although as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>' buddy he was in on it. He claims to have been the one to give Vince the idea of doing something drastic about Hart and the title; and in a 2012 DVD release, Michaels all but admits HHH planted the seed in his head. WWE has always denied that booker Pat Patterson had any involvement; although he was the one who came up with the sharpshooter spot. Invertedly, Earl Hebner, who was in on the entire thing from close to the beginning, is frequently described as having been unaware of anything until minutes before the match and having been bullied into going along with it against his wishes. Many people use Michaels' autobiography as a source about the Screwjob, but as someone said, the most controversial thing about the autobiography is "whether it belongs in the fiction section".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> gets quite a bit of the misblame as well. Contrary to popular belief, he was booked for another month of TV and house shows following Montreal, as well as having permission from WCW head Eric Bischoff to work the next pay-per-view in order to drop the title and finish up business in the WWF. His refusal to drop the title to Michaels was only after Shawn made it clear he wasn't losing to Bret under any circumstances. Stories of him taking the WWF title belt to WCW are equally ludicrous; the two previous incidents of this happening (one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, and one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Madusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Madusa">Madusa</a>) both ended up in nasty lawsuits, and hindsight shows WCW had no plans for the unbeaten WWF champion when he did in fact arrive.
</li><li> Hulk Hogan's can also apply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> starting from 2002 onwards, especially due to his longtime relationship with Stephanie McMahon, holding back smark favorites like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne">Evan Bourne</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWorldsGreatestTagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWorldsGreatestTagTeam">Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin</a>. Of course, this often avoids factors like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>'s retirement from wrestling and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> becoming an actor depleting WWE's main event talent until guys like John Cena and Batista were ready. Or that Vince McMahon has always favored not only the larger wrestlers but the ones who can exude the most over-the-top personality even before Triple H was in WWE.
</li><li> If <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RingOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RingOfHell">Ring of Hell</a></em> is to be believed, Triple H was responsible for Stone Cold Steve Austin's 2001 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">heel turn</a> after <em>WrestleMania X-Seven</em>. According to Austin's autobiography, <em>The Stone Cold Truth</em>, Austin wanted to turn heel to refresh his character.
</li><li> Triple H is pretty much the lightning rod for the fans wrath, regardless of whether or not he had anything to do with it. Considering he's married to the head of the WWE's creative department (and, if you believe some of the nastier rumors, closer to Vince than his own son Shane,) he's always accused to steering the company to always benefit himself. Have a favorite wrestler who isn't being pushed? Triple H is holding them back because he's "threatened." Crappy storyline? Triple H is burying someone he doesn't like. The blame has indeed continued on now that he has become WWE's head of talent - which would make sense given that he is officially the one running WWE's shows now, except that word around the company is that Vince still micromanages and meddles in the shows' affairs. It's supposedly gotten to the point that even Triple H is getting frustrated with Vince's meddling - ironic given his reputation for having been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Professional Butt-Kisser</a> for much of his career.
<ul><li> In recent years this has become subverted with the emergence of NXT, which Trips is allowed to run unfettered. The NXT product and shows are generally well-liked, with good, solidly booked storylines based around solid, fresh talent. This has actually led to fans calling for Vince to retire and turn the main roster over to Triple H to see if he can do the same thing with it.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> fans blame TNN for what they saw as lower quality shows when it was on that network. Everything on TV was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a>, and though he faced some initial level executive meddling, generally TNN took a "hands-off" approach to the promotion (extending to the promotion and provided budget, the real reason the show got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>). This confusion is not helped by the inclusion of a kayfabe network representative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> whose character attempted to tone down the hardcore style ECW was known for.
</li><li> For a long time, David Arquette received a large amount of undeserved flak for his winning of the WCW Championship by people thinking that he was the driving force behind the angle. A) He wasn't, B) as a wrestling fan, he knew it was a terrible idea and would've refused to do it had he not been contractually obligated, and C) he donated all of the money he made on the shows to paralyzed wrestler Darren Drozdov and the families of the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrianPillman">Brian Pillman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a>.

Even during his disastrous stint as the booker of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, a key thing to keep in mind is that, despite the booking meetings being attended by plenty of wrestling veterans and staff, <em>no-one hammered into him just how dumb some of his ideas were</em>.
</li><li> One thing Russo is blamed for that he shouldn't is the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MaeYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MaeYoung">Mae Young</a> gives birth to a hand" skit, which took place in early 2000, months after he left the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatMuta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatMuta">Keiji Mutoh</a> is sometimes unfairly blamed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a>'s down turn in the 2000s, with his resignation in 2011 in being used as the "proof". This is largely because quite a few fans who watched and loved the ever escalating efforts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GenichiroTenryu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GenichiroTenryu">Genichiro Tenryu</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa">Mitsuharu Misawa</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi">Kenta Kobashi</a> and Akira Taue in the 1990s <em>hated</em> Mutoh's "Puroresu Love" period that followed. Thing is, All Japan's decline can be linked back to the exodus of talent from the company thanks to a dispute with Giant Baba's widow Makoto to Misawa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH">Pro Wrestling NOAH</a>, a promotion many of Mutoh's detractors followed almost exclusively until it's own decline. The resignation had more to do with TARU assaulting Super Hate, leading to the latter having a stroke, than failure to turn the company around, which he actually succeeded in. While All Japan was behind the others, the "Puroresu Love" shows at least drew close to 10,000 and often well beyond it once they were established and also out drew some AJPW classics such as the tag league.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> owner Dixie Carter, the fans' chants of "Fire Russo!" were misblame, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a> only had a small part in writing their shows. Disregarding the fact that the shows still had Russo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">signature style</a> all over them, this hardly made for a better situation, as it implied that the entire booking team had their collective heads up their asses, rather than just one member. (Hilariously muddying the waters: after Russo was fired 2012 at the behest of Spike TV, he was secretly rehired as a consultant a year later. Dixie would keep up the facade of Russo not being involved until Spike removed TNA from its schedule.) It's also easier to chant "Fire Russo!" than it is to chant "Fire Russo or whoever is responsible for this awful match!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> gets constant flak for being a boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom">Five Moves of Doom</a> (amongst other things), yet as a performer, he really doesn't get the final say in the matter. Executive meddling is responsible for telling him what moves to do and how he should wrestle his matches. In fact, Cena said in an interview in the summer of '06 that he wanted to drop out of the Main Event scene after he jobbed to Edge at New Year's Revolution and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turn heel</a> to refresh his character. The writers collectively slapped him down and continued to write all of his lines at shows like they had since '03 when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turned face</a>. Cena's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> also tends to hold him exclusively responsible for the companies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">PG Era</a>. The PG-Era writing was a result of the company wanting to clean up their image after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a>'s double murder-suicide and to help with Linda McMahon's attempt at having a political career.
</li><li> WWE caught a lot of flak for releasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyJannetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyJannetty">Marty Jannetty</a> just days after signing him in 2006. Jannetty had to go onto his blog and insist WWE was not at fault and had no choice but to let him go after both sides discovered his probation prevented him from meeting their travel demands.
</li><li> The fall of extremely popular Diva <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> in WWE is this. The "Piggie James" feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool">Michelle McCool</a> was followed by James dropping the Women's Title two weeks after winning it at Royal Rumble and her subsequent release led to fans immediately accusing WWE of burying a talented wrestler they thought was too fat in favor of a rail-thin blonde who was dating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>. In a 2010 interview after her release, James revealed that she didn't have a problem with the angle itself and she was released for causing issues on a tour.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> was amusingly blamed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheColonyWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheColonyWrestling">The Colony</a>, Super Smash Bros and Los Ice Creams not getting more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> bookings, as well as not getting stronger Ring Of Honor bookings, based on his known hatred of "cartoon wrestling" and statement he'd rather have RoHbot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">scrappies</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Hardy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Boys</a>. This is despite the fact he said that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chikara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chikara">Chikara</a> wrestlers were respectful and fine to work with. Their lack of booking had to do with not being contracted to ROH, which he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston">Delirious</a> could make suggestions about but <em>weren't</em> in charge of. He also gets blamed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a> being absent because he alleged they didn't bring in anyone new, even though he did want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a> back simply to appease the people who were already there and blaming him for things but couldn't convince Sinclair to pay for them since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag teams</a> "just as good" were available and didn't need to be flown in. In short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">his tendency to shoot off his mouth rather than keep his opinions to himself lead to it</a>, with him running off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana">Colt Cabana</a> being precedent for a whole flood. And even then, Cabana initially refused to return to ROH even after Cornette left and went back to OVW, saying he didn't like the new corporate owners either, and addressed the fact they mistakenly thought they could get him back after "the guy with the racket left" instead saying he returned for Carry Silkin.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The description for Type 5 of misblamed is also known as "Quarterback Syndrome", because a lot of mistakes (such as a bad play, a poorly executed play, etc) are automatically blamed on the quarterback of American football teams. When really, sometimes it isn't their fault at <em>all</em>.
<ul><li> And if it's not the quarterback, it's usually the head coach. Which is slightly more accurate, usually, but none but the most egotistical of them are in charge of choosing their teams (except in college football, of course).
</li><li> A good example is when Tennessee Titans back-up quarterback Kerry Collins was hugely blamed for the team's abysmal blunder against the New England Patriots in 2009 (the one with the 59-0 score), though mostly from people who only watched snippets from ESPN, and only spotted his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">-7 passing yards</a>. For those who actually watched the entire game, it told a different story. Although it's true that Collins didn't play his best, he certainly fared much better than the receivers he threw the ball to. His best passes often resulted in a no gain, yard loss or a drop, or only inched forward with maybe a yard or two gain. Worst of all, Collins tossed the ball to one receiver, who idiotically backpedaled <em>twenty two yards</em> to avoid getting tackled, but failed anyway and resulted in a huge yard lossage. Unfortunately, the ESPN replay didn't note this, so everyone thought Collins caused the suckage when it was multiple factors that caused the horrific loss (like god awful defense and special teams, being a couple others).
</li><li> Relatedly, it's also fairly common, as you'll see below, that a team's loss will be blamed on a single play, even if there were a dozen or so other bad plays that happened within the same game that contributed to the loss.
<ul><li> One of the bigger cases in point: The 2001 Texas-Oklahoma game, where Texas' loss is put all on Chris Simms throwing a late 4th-quarter interception that Teddy Lehman ran into the end zone for a game-sealing touchdown. What no one remembers: If Nathan Vasher hadn't tried to field a punt on the previous play, the ball would have bounced into the end zone and Texas would have gotten the ball at the 20-yard-line. Instead, Vasher had to fall on the ball and Texas started inside the 5; this allowed OU to blitz, and Simms had no choice but to throw <em>something</em> fast or else get sacked in his own end zone for a safety (2 points for OU and Texas loses the ball) that would have sealed the game anyway.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Of course, it also works the other way. Tim Tebow became the biggest example of Quarterback Syndrome in reverse, getting <em>every single bit</em> of credit for the Denver Broncos 2011 turnaround. When the Broncos defense intercepts the opposing quarterback's pass in his own territory near the end of the game, leading to the Broncos kicker getting an easy game-winning field goal, and everyone says "Tebow does it again!" it's gotten pretty ridiculous.
</li><li> Fran Tarkenton, a quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings from the '70s, is often known as the "quarterback who lost four Superbowls". Actually, the Vikings first Superbowl loss was with Joe Kapp at the helm. Similarly, John Elway was known as being a quarterback who lost four Superbowls, when the Broncos first loss was with Craig Morton at the helm.
</li><li> After the Baltimore Ravens won the Superbowl in 2012, quarterback Joe Flacco was signed to the most lucrative contract in football history. He proceeded to have a miserable 2013 (his quarterback rating in the final game of the season against division rivals the Cincinnati Bengals was in the 40s), and some Ravens fans are already calling for the team to cut him. Of course, Flacco's best receiver was traded away in the offseason as were three of his offensive lineman, and his formerly dependable running back Ray Rice averaged 2 yards a carry for the season.
<ul><li> It was because of that contract that the Ravens had to get rid of those other players in order to stay under the salary cap. Of course, that should still place blame mostly on management for offering the contract and not taking into account who they would have to get rid of in exchange and how it would affect the team.
</li></ul></li><li> The infamous Mark Sanchez "butt fumble", in which he ran into one of his offensive lineman's rear ends and fumbled the football, happened after fullback Lex Hilliard missed a handoff, and the butt he ran into was Brandon Moore, who was being driven back by defensive lineman Vince Wilfork.
</li><li> The ESPN Classic series "Top Five Reasons You Can't Blame" was devoted to this, listing some of the most infamous moments in sports and giving reasons why the blame shouldn't solely go to the one person (or group) that took all the heat. Incidents covered included:
<ul><li> Don't mention Don Denkinger in St. Louis. The former Major League umpire is blamed for the Cardinals losing the 1985 World Series due to his blown call at first base in the ninth inning of Game 6. This ignores that 1) the Cards had a three games to one lead over the Royals and scored only two runs in the last three games, 2) They made three defensive mistakes after the call that all contributed to the loss, and 3) They were more focused on blaming Denkinger than trying to win Game 7, which the Royals won 11-0.
</li><li> The 1986 World Series would produce its own epic case of misblame, one which has become entrenched in baseball lore. In Game 6 of the series, the New York Mets would come back in extra innings, scoring the winning run of that game when first baseman Bill Buckner made an error and failed to field a ground ball hit between his legs. The Mets promptly won Game 7 and became champions, prolonging the legendary agony of the Red Sox. Easy case for blaming Buckner, right? Not so much. Those who do conveniently ignore the fact that Boston's bullpen had already blown two leads before the error occurred, with Boston having lost a 3-2 lead in regular innings and a 5-3 lead in the 10th before Buckner's error. The situation in the 10th is particularly notable, since it happened despite the fact that when the Mets rally started they had 2 outs and no baserunners, and just about everyone except the Mets players themselves had conceded defeat. (The TV crew had already announced one Red Sox player the player of the game and named another Sox player the World Series MVP, the message board in the Mets stadium briefly displayed a message congratulating the Red Sox on their victory, etc.) Boston relievers then gave up three hits in a row and pitcher Bob Stanley allowed the Mets to tie the game by throwing a wild pitch nowhere near target that let the tying run score and the winning run to move to second base. On top of <em>that</em>, Buckner (who was nearing the end of his long career) had leg injuries, particularly in his ankle, that should have kept him out of game, but Boston manager John McNamara insisted on Buckner playing so he could take part in the victory. With regards to the play itself, Buckner had to play the ball well behind first base, and it is doubtful that he would have beaten the speedy baserunner Mookie Wilson (who held the Mets team record for stolen bases until 2008) to the bag even if he had fielded the ball cleanly. (Buckner had about 1.6 seconds from when the ball reached him to when Mookie Wilson touched first base, not exactly a lot of time to make the play.) Lastly, if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly and gotten the out, it would have preserved the tie and sent the game into a new inning, it would not have given Boston the win, something which quite a few people overlook. <em>And on top of all that</em>, Boston still had Game 7 to work with, where they once again jumped out to an early lead and blew it.
</li><li> In the 2003 National League Championship Series, Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman went after a foul ball at the same time left fielder Moisés Alou was trying to catch it. Other Cubs fans heckled and threw stuff at Bartman until security had to escort him out of Wrigley Field, and given after the incident the Cubs went from a 3-0 lead to a 8-3 defeat, Bartman was tormented enough to change his phone number and have police cars outside his house, along with being labeled a physical example of the Cubs' jinx. Of course, the fact the Cubs had such a disastrous collapse, and the Marlins won not only the ensuing game 7, but the World Series afterwards, shows there was more to this defeat than a single fan's interference.
</li><li> For most people, the Buffalo Bills' loss at Super Bowl XXV is summed up with two words: "Wide Right". Here are other reasons the Bills lost to the Giants: the Bills were outcoached by the New York Giants, won in addition to Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, had the likes of Bill Belichick and Tom Coughlin (both of whom would become multiple Super Bowl winning head coaches later). The Giants logged 40:33 time of posession (a record still standing as of 2016). There was also Belichick's game plan which muzzled the Bills' "K-Gun" no-huddle offense. Scott Norwood's famous kick was a 47-yard field goal <em>on grass</em>, and he was not good at kicking field goals on grass (not to mention, while nowhere near impossible, a 47-yarder no chip shot either). Unlike many such examples, Norwood has had a positive reputation within Buffalo (no one picks out a team's flaws better than its hometown fans), was cheered by diehard Buffalo fans at a parade held after the Super Bowl, and even spent the next year (where Buffalo again made it to the Super Bowl) with the team.
</li></ul></li><li> College basketball fans, sportswriters and TV commentators all grossly overestimated the importance of the RPI (Ratings Percentage Index) ranking in the NCAA's selection procedure for its annual men's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">basketball</a> tournament. Every year there were complaints about teams with a high RPI being left out or teams with a low RPI making the field, all concluding that the RPI is deeply flawed and the NCAA should get rid of it. But the NCAA always said that the RPI was just meant as a simple table to compare teams early on in the process, and that their decisions ultimately come down to who the team in question beat and who they lost to. The NCAA finally concluded that the RPI had structural flaws and replaced it with the new NET ratings starting in the 2018-19 season, but again tried to emphasize that it was one evaluation tool of many.
</li><li> Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez was heavily criticised for paying about 100 million euros to Manchester United for the transfer of a single player, Cristiano Ronaldo, especially because it happened in the middle of the post 2008 worldwide economic crisis. However, the transfer was signed a year before by his predecessor Ramón Calderón, who was betting on Ronaldo's arrival saving his scandal-ridden presidency. He didn't resist the whole year and resigned before it passed. After his election, Pérez found that Calderón's agreement forced the club to either pay the 100 million for Ronaldo or a 30 million penalty for breach of contract and get nothing in return.
</li><li> Watching ESPN's documentary, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://30for30.espn.com/film/small-potatoes-who-killed-the-usfl.html">Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> the answer to the titular question would seem to be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>". While Trump, as owner of the New Jersey Generals, started a bidding war with the NFL over college players (one that most USFL owners didn't have the resources to compete in), the real downfall of the league — the disastrous decision to move from spring to fall and compete directly with the NFL — couldn't have been done without a consensus of owners going along with Trump. Much like the Vince Russo entries above, it's unfair to say he single-handedly destroyed the league. Though Trump doesn't help his own cause by defending everything he did as "the right thing to do" and accepting none of the blame for the USFL's swift and epic collapse.
</li><li> Losing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> can lead to the fifth case. In Brazil, there are four known scapegoats:
<ul><li> Barbosa, the goalkeeper in 1950 — where they lost the finals to Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro. He's famously quoted as: "The biggest penalty for a crime is 30 years. I'm currently paying 43 for a crime I didn't commit!"
</li><li> Toninho Cerezo, whose defensive mistake led to Italy's second goal in their 3-2 victory in 1982 (a simple draw would have put Brazil into the semi-finals, but the second goal turned the tide toward Italy).
</li><li> Zico, who missed a penalty against France in the quarter-finals in 1986. The game ended up 1-1, with an eventual French victory in the penalty shootout.
</li><li> In 2006, while Zidane was taking a free kick, Roberto Carlos was adjusting his sock. Thierry Henry passed behind him and scored France's victory goal.
</li></ul></li><li> Goalkeeper Tommy Salo was blamed for Sweden's 4-3 loss in the quarterfinals against Belarus in the 2002 Olympic hockey tournament. While he can be blamed for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-7N2Va1XqY">the endlessly replayed final goal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the coach pointed out that it wasn't Salo's fault that a Swedish team full of NHL pros only scored three goals (out of 47 shots) on a minor team like Belarus.
</li><li> The Hillsborough Stadium disaster of 1989, when several Liverpool soccer fans were crushed to death in the standing pens at an FA Cup game (for those who are confused, in those days most soccer stadiums had lower levels with no seats that were enclosed by cage pens). Immediately after the disaster, <em>The Sun</em> published a front page story stating the fans themselves were to blame, intentionally overcrowding the pens and then attacking policemen after the cages broke and they spilled onto the field. It turned out that there was no security to inform and direct fans to the less crowded pens, the police actually prevented ambulances from entering the stadium after the fence broke, and the fans were trying to shuttle the injured out to the ambulances (which the police also prevented). Furthermore, stories about fans attacking police officers attempting to tend to the injured were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">outright fabrications</a>. <em>The Sun</em> is still boycotted in Liverpool to this day.
</li><li> The baseball version of "Quarterback Syndrome" could be called "A-Rod Syndrome", named for Alex Rodriguez. While Rodriguez is one of the best players in history, he has- with the exception of one year- never done well in the playoffs. As a result, when the New York Yankees are eliminated from the playoffs most of the blame and focus usually falls on Alex Rodriguez. This usually ignores the fact that he is rarely if ever the cause of the failure, but rather part of a wider problem. In 2012, for example, Alex Rodriguez was being <em>benched</em> in the postseason and being blamed for the failure of the Yankees, despite the fact that other players like Robinson Cano and Curtis Granderson weren't hitting well either and that Derek Jeter, the Yankees' most famous postseason hero, had gotten hurt early in the ALCS series.
<ul><li> Similarly, a lower-level focus came on Prince Fielder in that season's World Series, despite the fact that almost the entire Detroit Tiger team was generally anemic at the plate during that series.
</li></ul></li><li> New York Giants fans still shudder at the mention of Trey Junkin, who botched a snap for what could have been a game-winning field goal in the 2002 playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers. Many fans inexplicably ignore the fact that Junkin ha literally been hired the week befored, after going into retirement at the end of a very successful career, and was very rusty as a result. They also tend to gloss over the fact that the Giants blew a massive 38-14 lead in only a quarter-and-a-half of football, resulting in the second biggest blown lead in NFL history. Then there's the fact that the referees missed a penalty on the final play that should have allowed a re-kick of the field goal and redemption for Junkin. The game apparently haunts Junkin to this day, resulting in the guy misblaming himself for a situation he never should have been in.
</li><li> While Americans have not taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a> as a spectator sport well, they are often blamed for creating the word soccer, an alternative word for the sport which is a colloquial abbreviation of association (from assoc.). However, the word was actually coined by Charles Wreford Brown, an Oxford student (in England) said to have been fond of shortened forms such as "brekkers" for breakfast and "rugger" for rugby football, and back in the day, it was used by rich folk to distinguish Association Football from Rugby. When the sport arrived in the U.S. in the late 19th century, it was called Association Football (and was surprisingly quite a popular sport at the time) until after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, mainly due to the popularity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>, and the word soccer was adopted to differentiate with the two footballs. However since then, soccer in the US <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPolynomial">would fall into obscurity until recently,</a> due in thanks to "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.bigsoccer.com/soccer/roger-allaway/2010/10/25/what-was-the-quot-soccer-war-quot/">soccer war<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" between the country's major league organization and FIFA. This sport's naming has also reigned true in some other countries like Canada, the Caribbean, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand; who have adopted or invented another football code, either as their "main" football or alongside Association Football. However, the British have since grown to hate this word, and have been hell-bent on lambasting the U.S. for it, never minding that the word came from the same place the modern rules of the game were made, the latter fact the British embrace and the former fact the British will often deny.
</li><li> The NCAA "death penalty" in 1987 is often thought to have killed the Southern Methodist University football team, and is often regarded as an argument against strong NCAA sanctions against any particular team. In reality, when the full extent of the pay-to-play scandal was brought to light, the university itself (and the church bishops overseeing it) decided to de-emphasize its football program (threatening to drop football entirely if need be), imposing extremely tight recruiting restrictions, making the team play in the tiny, on-campus Ownby Stadium (which the Mustangs hadn't played in since 1947) instead of Texas Stadium or the Cotton Bowl, and severing ties with almost all players and boosters associated with the program in the 1980s, greatly alienating the program's supporters.
<ul><li> Furthermore, many want to directly blame the fallout of the SMU death penalty for causing the breakup of the Southwest Conference. However, the 1984 Supreme Court ruling <em>NCAA vs University of Oklahoma</em> probably played as much if not more of a factor, as it opened the floodgates for college conferences to negotiate their own TV contracts and subsequently start poaching off schools to make themselves look more attractive to networks (which college sports is still dealing with to this day). It's largely suspected that the SWC's biggest schools at Texas, Texas A&amp;M and Arkansas were already considering going elsewhere even before the penalties were handed down on SMU.
</li></ul></li><li> Baseball player Fred Merkle spent almost his entire professional career being blamed for costing the New York Giants the 1908 National League pennant because he failed to touch second base after a game-winning hit. What most of the fans who blamed him conveniently forgot was at the time the rule requiring runners to touch the next base after a hit was rarely enforced on "walkoff" hits and customarily ignored by veteran players. It was Merkle's misfortune that Cubs player Johnny Evers was a stickler for the rulebook, and that umpire Hank O'Day was willing to enforce it.
<ul><li> Furthermore, many of those who choose to blame Merkle don't know the specific reason Merkle didn't bother touching second base and why he and the Giants didn't expect the rule to be enforced: The fans were pouring out onto the field, and the Giants players were all running for the clubhouse for their own safety. It was because of the fans being on the field that they couldn't continue the game even though nullifying the winning hit/run simply kept the game tied and thus forced it to be replayed at season's end.
</li></ul></li><li> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is often blamed for the annual rule changes, especially the recent ones that protect the offensive players. It's the NFL's Competition Committee that determines the rule changes. Though Goodell has been a vocal proponent of many of the changes.
</li><li> When a college sports team, such as the Oregon Ducks football team, introduces new hi-tech, expensive equipment, uniforms, facilities, etc., people will criticize the university for spending so much money on their athletics rather than academics. The truth is most of the money that funds the teams come from boosters, such as Oregon alum and Nike founder Phil Knight, with the express purpose of it being used that way. In fact, many teams rely solely on booster money and use very little of a university's allotted athletics budget.
</li><li> NFL legend Jerry Rice took a lot of heat when, during his brief, late-career stint with the Seattle Seahawks, he wore jersey #80 (which he had his entire career). Problem was that #80 had already been retired for Steve Largent (the player Rice surpassed for most of his receiving records). Most assumed Rice big-leagued the Seahawks and asked for #80 and the Seahawks captiulated, rather than make a fuss. According to Largent himself, the Seattle general manager at the time called Largent and told him that Rice wanted #80 and asked if it would be okay if they un-retired it. After Largent said yes, the GM called Rice and told him Largent <em>wanted</em> him to wear #80.
</li><li> The England football team have a well-known habit of crashing out of major tournaments on penalties. Despite it being rare that England miss only one penalty (Gareth Southgate in Euro 96 being a notable exception), the press and public always tend to blame whoever missed the final penalty. In particular, Chris Waddle and David Batty got most of the country's ire after the 1990 and 1998 World Cups respectively, despite Stuart Pearce and Paul Ince also having missed penalties. Oddly enough, this was inverted after Euro 2004, where few put the blame on Darius Vassell (whose penalty miss was actually the one that caused England to be eliminated), and David Beckham instead took the heat for an admittedly spectacularly awful first penalty.
</li><li> One of the biggest controversies of the 2013-14 NHL realignment was that the Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings were placed in separate conferences (the West and East, respectively), thus breaking up one of the league's biggest rivalries. Fans naturally blamed NHL Comissioner Gary Bettman for it since he has a history of disregarding league traditions. However, it was actually the Red Wings who requested they be placed in the Eastern Conference because they were sick of being forced to play a quarter of their games three time zones away, making their players fatigued and screwing up TV broadcast times.
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment">Bettman Stripes</a>", the vertical piping featured on some of the Reebok Edge uniforms introduced in 2007, along with the Edge redesigns of certain uniforms in particular. Ultimately, this comes down to the individual teams allowing the manufacturer to make these changes, particularly since several teams did, in fact, stand pat and keep their existing designs, while a couple more teams actually adopted more traditional-looking designs than they had been wearing before Edge.

<ul><li> The "Roving Mauler" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> monster gets a lot of "what drug were they on" reactions from its appearance. Said appearance is lifted from the demon <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buer.gif">Buer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, who goes all the way back to the 16th century. Really, this just raises the question of what drug were they on in the 16th century?
<ul><li> One of the more common beliefs about 3.5 is that the game's notoriously poor balance towards casters was caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> from the release of too many handbooks, and people should stick to core books only. In reality, the wide opinion of optimizers is that the <em>least</em> balanced way to play 3.5 is to use only the core books. Nearly all the most broken caster tricks in the game, from polymorphing to scry-and-die to the Candle of Invocation to Natural Spell, are found in the core books - meanwhile, most of the popular non-caster tactics, like Leap Attack or martial adepts, were only introduced in splatbooks. In an all-splat game, the caster's power doesn't really change because they're already broken, while the low-tier classes can actually do stuff.
</li></ul></li><li> Head designer Mark Rosewater is often blamed for many things the players hate about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>, even things that he had nothing to do with. And indeed, even things that have absolutely nothing to do with his department — as the face and voice of the company, he's just the one chosen to announce such things, leading many players to blame him for the decisions he likely had no say it whatsoever... Then again, many other things are entirely his fault.
</li><li> Matt Ward is often blamed for just about everything people don't like from 5th Edition and on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, most of which were not his fault, or were done on orders from Games Workshop. His rewriting the Necrons backstory was an editorial demand that came down from higher-ups. A controversial story in which Grey Knights murdered an entire convent of Sisters of Battle is actually not that out of character for the Inquisition, with whom the Grey Knights are in lockstep. The change in the meta from largely assault-based to largely shooting-based armies between 5th and 6th Editions was also a change mandated by GW brass to try and sell more models and is not specific to anything Ward did unilaterally. His codices are scrutinized for being overpowered when first released, however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> has long been part of the game. The new codices are supposed to be more powerful to try and drum up interest and sell more models. (Case in point, the extremely powerful 6th Edition Tau Empire codex wasn't even written by him.) The lack of quality control and playtesting of codices is also the result of a direction change at Games Workshop to generate content in a rapid manner.
<ul><li> The one thing Ward is guilty of is being a shameless Ultramarines fanboy and interjecting this viewpoint into his fluff at the expense of the pride, history and identity of some other much-beloved Space Marines chapters.

<ul><li> Saying the Japanese ruined <em>Pokémon</em> when the franchise was <em>created</em> by a Japanese company.
<ul><li> Blaming and crediting Nintendo for <em>Pokémon</em> games, when Nintendo is only the <em>publisher</em>.
</li><li> Also when the reboot happened, many blamed Game Freak which for once, had nothing to do with it.
</li><li> Saying Ken Sugimori is running out of ideas and pointing towards Vanilluxe. Vanilluxe was designed by <em>James Turner</em>, an Englishman.
</li></ul></li><li> Saying Nintendo ran out of ideas and reused music for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsCoded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsCoded">Kingdom Hearts Re:coded</a></em>.

Nintendo is not even the <em>publisher</em>.
</li><li> Saying <em>Disney</em> should have finished <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThiefAndTheCobbler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThiefAndTheCobbler">The Thief and the Cobbler</a></em>. Disney had <em>nothing to do</em> with that movie, it was made to be an anti-Disney, and the art style looks <em>nothing</em> like the art style of Disney movies.
<ul><li> Well, since Disney owned Miramax, the company responsible for <em>Thief</em>'s Macekre, Roy Disney for a long time was talking about having the Disney animators, many of whom trained with Richard Williams and brought that influence to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>, finish animating Williams' cut of the movie. But then Roy Disney left the company and then died, and Miramax closed and their library appears to have been sold to various other companies, so good luck with that.
</li></ul></li><li> Pointing fingers at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> for stuff done in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> series after it was bought out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>.
<ul><li> Blaming Disney for changes to <em>Doug</em>, when most of the original crew was still retained.
</li></ul></li><li> Bashing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> (or Time Warner) for removing music on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, when it was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMusicGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMusicGroup">Warner Music Group</a>, a <em>completely separate</em> record company. And neither Warner Bros. nor Time Warner owns WMG anymore. WMG spun off from Time Warner in 2004; since then, they've been owned by private investors, then a company called Access Industries, not Time Warner. At least the record company still keeps "Warner" in their name.
</li><li> Anger at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> for not making a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> anime already.

However, they were recently suspended by a Japanese company named Nippon Ad Systems—LittleKuriboh even stated himself that people should stop blaming 4Kids and 4Kids are still blamed to this day.
<ul><li> Granted it wasn't even the company that banned him, but one of the faulty copyright bots YouTube uses to enforce copyright.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> often ends up blaming movies for elements that originated from the works they were based on.

<ul><li> On that note, Rachel and Malcolm are often blamed for things people don't like about the new Nostalgia Critic episodes, even though they have far less creative control than previously and they've said they just show up and get told what to do.
</li></ul></li><li> The more irrational fans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Yogscast">Yogscast</a> tend to accuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/InTheLittleWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/InTheLittleWood">In The Little Wood</a> of "replacing" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips">Sips</a> for a series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a> Murder</em>. The reality... is that Sips simply wasn't available.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sjin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sjin">Sjin</a> did not simply end his "Feed the World" series (part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/YogscastMinecraftSeries">Yogscast Minecraft Series</a>) and choose to reboot it. The "Heartbleed" patch basically corrupted the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> server that the Yogs played on, meaning that a reboot was necessary.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley">Lewis Brindley</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane">Simon Lane</a> tend to get a lot of flack for not finishing <em>Shadow of Israphel</em>. While Lewis is involved in the creative process, he didn't make the series by himself (which, considering that the whole series began due to other Yogscast members pranking him, should be telling). Add to the fact that the creative team for <em>SOI</em> has largely moved elsewhere and you have a pretty huge case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment">Artist Disillusionment</a>. Simon has seemingly <em>never</em> been involved in the creative process, only turning up to play whatever storyline gets thrown his and Lewis' way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips">Sips</a> came under fire for a seeming shift to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a></em> and nothing else come late 2014, with some accusing him of either selling out or screwing them over. The reality is that many of his ongoing Let's Play videos, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em>, were lost due to his hard drive malfunctioning and dozens of videos subsequently going missing; this forced the rest of the Yogscast to essentially give him content to fill the gaps, leading to the increase in <em>Gmod</em>. Similarly, he came under fire after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Turpster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Turpster">Turpster</a> disappeared from videos come early 2015, with fans accusing him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/HatFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/HatFilms">Hat Films</a> of kicking him out due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> (some going from calling for him to be removed to missing him). In reality, Turps had just become a father and quite understandably won't be involved as much due to his newborn baby.
</li><li> After a fairly ugly Twitter spat between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SimonLane">Simon Lane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCynicalBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCynicalBrit">The Cynical Brit</a>, many unsubbed not just from Simon and Lewis' joint channel, but also from other content creators such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/DuncanJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/DuncanJones">Duncan Jones</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/ZoeyProasheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/ZoeyProasheck">Zoey Proasheck</a>, even though they had <em>literally nothing</em> to do with the events.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> fans blame director Kerry Shawcross and writer Miles Luna of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Pyrrha Nikos</span> in the Volume 3 finale "End of the Beginning" as just nothing more than shock value so they can show that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>. It took tweets from the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyOum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyOum">Monty Oum</a>'s fiancee and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pyrrha's voice actress</span> to reveal that this was something Monty planned from the very beginning. There are many smaller examples of them getting the blame for Monty's ideas, such as the show's tendency to make new characters dramatically overpowered in their debuts and then nerf them for all subsequent appearances; Miles and Kerry actually worked to <em>tone down</em> this quirk to avoid <em>completely</em> breaking the show's internal logic.
</li><li> The drag and drop animations site <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GoAnimate">GoAnimate</a></em> removed several text-to-speech voices (from sites such as Ivona, Oddcast and VoiceForge) in early 2016. Most of the non-ironic fanbase, who were already mad at site founder Alvin Hung for trying to turn the site into a business-only site and removing most social features, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">took this as a second attack against them</a> and proceeded to blame Alvin Hung for being "greedy". Truth is, however, most of the voices had expired licenses (and on top of that, mostly outdated) and Hung decided not to renew them.
</li><li> Many, <em>many</em> fans blame CBS for the culling of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> fan film community, accusing CBS of being jealous of the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PreludeToAxanar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PreludeToAxanar">Prelude to Axanar</a></em> and appointing the rules so that only they could make <em>Star Trek</em> productions. What many fans love to ignore is that the producers of <em>Axanar</em> were <em>profiting</em> from this and not actually being a non-profit work. CBS had to step in to protect their work and it was the <em>Axanar</em> creators' refusal to back down that lead to the rules being set up.
</li><li> The fansite <a class="urllink" href="https://www.smuncensored.com/comparison.php?episodeid=25">SM Uncensored<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Lita</a> being a "butchy, trash-talking whore" was a product of the infamously censored DIC dub. Quite frankly, that was pretty much the personality Makoto had in the original Japanese version of the anime. The three-dimensional anime!Makoto who's both girly and tomboyish that the fandom worships only exists in their imaginations. Makoto didn't do much in the anime and didn't have much personality to match. Most changes to her lie in the transition from manga to anime, thus Toei is more to blame than DIC or Optimum; the dubbers were simply working with what they had, though they undoubtedly made the problem worse.

<ul><li> Many people blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy Doo</a> for ruining <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> (specifically, dumping half the original cast, switching to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoShorts">Two Shorts</a> format, and the franchise's first clumsy attempts to lose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">"Scooby-Doo" Hoax</a>) due to the timing of his introduction, despite the fact that the conventional mystery format and half the cast were dumped over a year <em>after</em> his debut. Ironically, Scrappy is what probably saved the show from cancellation way back in 1979. And the success of that new incarnation of Scooby Doo is likely what has kept the franchise going on for some 40 years.
</li><li> Fans of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> comic book attacked the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> cartoon for excluding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> while including most of the other Justice League sidekicks. In reality, Wonder Girl was legally barred from appearing in the first season of the show due to rights issues. These same issues had earlier kept the character from appearing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, and Wonder Woman from appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>. She eventually appeared in the second season.
<ul><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> have since gone on to blame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman">Beware the Batman</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> for the cancellations of their beloved cartoons. Never mind that the creative teams behind the new shows had <em>nothing</em> to do with cancelling the older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation">DC Nation</a> cartoons. And <em>Beware The Batman</em> got cancelled and written off soon after.
</li><li> Similarly, many, <em>many</em> people automatically blame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> ending their runs in 2017 and 2018 respectively. While it is certainly true that <em>Teen Titans Go</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">Adored by the Network</a>, and has taken over time slots once used by other shows, it is not directly responsible for those shows ending. Those decisions were made by the series' creators themselves, as they were already coming to the end of their storylines.
</li><li> Many fans blamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a> for Wally West's death in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12l8nm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12l8nm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12l8nm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a> as the show has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> by Warner Bros.

</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> fans have blamed the show for not being fun like the 2003 show. However, the show is actually more like <em>Teen Titans</em> from the comics as influenced from the Geoff Johns run, while the 2003 show is actually more like <em>Young Justice</em> from the comics though with elements of the New Teen Titans and the Sixties incarnation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelAnimation">Marvel Animation</a> fans love to blame everything wrong with any Marvel cartoon on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a>. Notably, he was blamed for cancelling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> to replace it with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em>. In reality, <em>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em> was not doing well with the network's target demographic and had a lack of merchandise, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> commissioned <em>Assemble</em> in order to have a show more similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">the mega-hit live-action film</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, the episode introducing Dwight Conrad was originally scheduled for season 3, but was held back to season 5, despite the fact that the character appears in a number of episodes in between this. Many fans assumed that this was due to the Fox Network's seemingly random scheduling (which resulted in similar continuity errors regarding a few minor characters) but in fact some dialogue needed to be re-recorded and the actor playing Dwight wasn't available at the time. The decision to delay airing was made by the show's producers.
</li><li> Nickelodeon took a lot of heat for the second half of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> taking so long to air that two episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">premiered in Canada</a> and another two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResolutionWillNotBeTelevised">on DVD</a>. However, this was because production on the finale had been delayed, and Nickelodeon didn't want to air less than half of a season only to have another hiatus right before the end of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's lots of rage surrounding the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">film spinoff</a> of the TV series , mostly about how it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a>'s "worst movie yet!" In fact, Lucas's input was more or less limited to suggesting the essentially already-made feature-length pilot be distributed theatrically instead of going straight to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>.
</li><li> Many blame Disney for canceling the series after it bought the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise in favor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>. But the rights to <em>The Clone Wars</em> were owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Warner Bros. obviously wouldn't give up the airing rights to one of their best shows to a rival company</a>. <em>Rebels</em> was actually in the works <em>before</em> the Disney buyout, due to the ratings of <em>The Clone Wars</em> declining (meaning that the show was slowly becoming unprofitable) and the Lucasfilm crew still wanting to do a Star Wars animation show that branched off of <em>The Clone Wars</em>.
</li><li> Due to the turbulent status of the franchise in early 2018, it's becoming increasingly common for many to state that Disney only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled">uncancelled</a> <em>The Clone Wars</em> in order to bring an end to the controversies. However, given that most of those controversies were just a few months old, animation (especially as visually appealing as <em>The Clone Wars</em>) takes a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime">long</a></em> time to make, and the teaser clearly had fully animated segments, it had to have been in the works well before that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Warner Bros.' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Histeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Histeria">Histeria!</a></em> has received some undeserved bashing because the people in question think it got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em> cancelled. <em>Animaniacs</em> and <em>Freakazoid!</em> (which was canned <em>before</em> <em>Histeria!</em> even began production) were actually cancelled because the network was upset that they were more popular among people older than Kids' WB!'s target demographic.
<ul><li> <em>Freakazoid</em>'s cancellation is also sometimes blamed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Madman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Madman">Madman</a> creator Mike Allred, on the grounds that he sued over Freakazoid's similarity to his creation. This is not true. Mike has openly stated that he was unhappy that he didn't receive a credit for his influence, but he never sued — he didn't feel it was worth it.
</li></ul></li><li> Sites like Youtube have shown the unaired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PilotEpisode">Pilot Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em>, made in 1999 (before the show went live). Apparently people thought this was an attempt to restart the series despite the fact that the animation and designs were still being worked out (Ginger's Perm agrees). Apparently, that wasn't enough of a hint as people said the writers were racist because Miranda was shown as being a brown-haired Caucasian (as opposed to being black in the series). In truth, Miranda was actually animated as white for the pilot...but she was rectonned to be black because of her voice actress, Cree Summers. Also, Blake was made much more sophisticated...he's shown in the pilot as crashing a teenage party in his underwear for kicks.
</li><li> A very strong example of misblamed ignorance plus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> is the 2003 series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>. It was complained by fans of the '80s version for being an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> remake of the '80s version", with no Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang, or ultra-silly themes as well as how it was less faithful to the comics. Wrong — the 2003 series is actually <em>more</em> faithful to the comics and the <em>80s version</em> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> adaptation.
<ul><li> The <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures</em> comic book series doesn't help matters, since it was based off of the animated series and was probably read more by said complainers. Of course, Eastman and Laird's Mirage Studios didn't produce that book series—it was licensed out to Archie Comics.
</li></ul></li><li> People who don't realize there are <em>two</em> English dubs of at least the first three seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> like to slam 4Kids for their horrible "redub" of the series. The "redub" in question was done by a Canadian company and is actually more faithful to the original version than the 4Kids dub is.
<ul><li> On a latter note, 4Kids is sometimes blamed for plot holes they did not create. For example, Beta Academy is mentioned in the original Italian dub.
</li><li> Now that Nickelodeon owns the show, they're getting lots of criticism for their "changes" (new music, Layla's name to Aisha, etc.). Some of these people thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>. The truth: Nickelodeon's undoing many of 4Kids's changes to make a more faithful English dub.
</li><li> Nickelodeon's treatment of the show is infamous but there's a lot of ambiguity over what was going on behind the scenes. While sending the show to Nick Jr. wasn't unusual for Nick, Rainbow has said that they wanted to retool the show for younger children (due to experimenting with adult-themed spin-offs, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WorldOfWinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WorldOfWinx">World of Winx</a></em> and the live-action Netflix series). Rainbow ending their deal with Nickelodeon is often seen as them realizing too late the deal was a bad idea, but Rainbow has said that they had issues affording the California voice actors.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> has taken some criticism for making the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie">movie</a> when they actually didn't because they didn't own the characters until three years after the movie's release. It was actually made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FilmRoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FilmRoman">Film Roman</a> and distributed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms">Miramax Films</a>. The only thing Warner Bros. has to do with it is distributing the DVD release.
</li><li> Most of the hate for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProblemSolverz">The Problem Solverz</a></em> stems from the disproven idea that it was the show that replaced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>. SBT was cancelled because it couldn't secure any merchandising deals, while <em>Problem Solverz</em> had already been in the works for years before said decision was made. For being the most hated cartoon on the Internet, it seems quite a significant portion of people are misinformed.
<ul><li> Likewise, the network's current president Christina Miller is often blamed for the channel focusing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">comedic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016">cartoons</a> rather than airing more action-oriented stuff. Some viewers even accuse her of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian">Moral Guardian</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">actively sabotages shows</a> that are even <em>slightly</em> action-based just because they aren't what she thinks the viewing audience wants. In reality, action-based shows were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">already in decline</a> on the network well before Miller took the helm, with examples including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, all of which were cancelled in the years prior to Miller's arrival. While Miller has certainly continued the network's trend towards comedy, she cannot be blamed for starting it.
<ul><li> Heck, several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> fans blamed her for ending the shows, when in fact, creators of both shows (Pendleton Ward and J.G. Quintel) decided to end it with seasons 9 and 8, respectively.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It's usually held that the mature content in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpyAdultPartyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpyAdultPartyCartoon">Ren &amp; Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"</a></em> was the result of John Kricfalusi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a>. Given John K's departure from the original series was partly over Nickelodeon's censorship policies, it's an easy assumption to make, but according to Kricfalusi himself it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced on him by higher-ups at Spike TV</a>, a charge supported by the fact that Spike also wanted to give the same "adult" treatment to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> gets blamed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilledAboveTheTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilledAboveTheTitle">upstaging</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement">credit</a> on Henry Selick for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em>. Debates rage over who did the most work and will go as far as to insult one or the other. In actuality Burton chose Selick to direct <em>Nightmare</em> so he could direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>. Another fact is, directors, actors and even producers, rarely control the billing of a film. Such things are done by the studio marketing department and the executives. The lines get even more blurred when it came to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> which advertised as being <em>From the Director of The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, which is factual as Selick did direct both <em>Nightmare</em> and <em>Coraline</em>. Still Burton gets blamed for upstaging credit for <em>Coraline</em> despite the fact Burton didn't have <em>anything</em> to do with <em>Coraline</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow">The Superhero Squad Show</a></em> is sometimes used as an example of the Disney/Marvel merger ruining Marvel forever, but it began production before Disney bought them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> tends to get misblamed on a lot of things (possibly due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">hatedom</a> claiming that he is everything that's wrong with animation). One notable one is the animation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchHartman">Butch Hartman</a>. He is automatically blamed for those just because he's friends with the guy despite the fact that he has nothing to do with those projects. Instead, it's Hartman and Fred Seibert (the latter which never seems to get any sort of hate despite being the producer of those shows). And of course, there's the cash grabs and merchandising that the studio does and not him.
<ul><li> Another notable misblaming is MacFarlane being somehow blamed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> being cancelled. The truth is that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> was canceled one full year before <em>Futurama</em> was and MacFarlane wasn't even doing anything with Fox at the time. Also, MacFarlane and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> happen to be friends in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real life</a> so MacFarlane probably would have wanted <em>Futurama</em> to continue. He also had a voice role in the fourth direct-to-DVD <em>Futurama</em> movie.
</li><li> MacFarlane is also blamed for the the direction that <em>Family Guy</em> went through after the show was un-canceled. MacFarlane is barely involved with the show's scripts, with the actual writing coming from the story writers. That said, MacFarlane has veto power over what's in the scripts that do make it to air (in addition to voicing three of the main characters), so his hands aren't completely clean when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">poorly-received episodes and gags</a>.

Due to Disney's acquisition of Marvel, Sony gave away their TV rights in order to keep making Spider-Man movies.

</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> fans claim that "Disney ruined <em>Doug</em>" when they bought the rights to the show and un-cancelled it. In fact, buying <em>Doug</em> (and slapping their name on it) was the only thing they did to the show. Creator Jim Jinkens made all the changes himself.
</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: voice actress April Stewart has been blamed by some sore fans for Mona Marshall not having as many roles, as well as the exit of Eliza Schneider. In actuality, Schneider quit on her own terms in 2003 due to a salary dispute and issues with her union <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13aro9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13aro9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13aro9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Around this time, the SAG was advising voice actresses to <em>not</em> accept roles for the show due to its non-union status, or they would risk being blacklisted or having their health coverage stripped. Along with fines, these are among the expected consequences for union actors who take on non-union work.</span>. Stewart herself had to use an alias for her early work in the show until matters could be settled. It's also worth noting that Marshall always had voiced fewer female characters in comparison, as Schneider had handled the majority of the roles after Mary Kay Bergman's death.
<ul><li> Due to old fansites like Beef-Cake and convention advertisements mistaking Mona Marshall as the second voice of Wendy, Schneider herself received some blame and misconception of "usurping" the role. In actuality, she'd always voiced the character and simply modified her take after a while. In comparison, April Stewart would later receive flack for making Wendy sound too old, until it was revealed that it was the creators' own decision to not speed up her voice as much (while Mary Kay Bergman could naturally perform the higher voice, Schneider and Stewart had to have their voices digitally modified).
</li><li> An in-universe Type 4 example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in "Night of the Living Homeless", where Kyle tries to come up with an idea with what to do with the homeless, and Cartman's idea was to jump over them with his skateboard. The other boys either thank Kyle for the idea that was obviously Cartman's, or in Stan's case, get baffled by it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has a serious case of Type 5: Fans who dislike the newer seasons generally say it's all the fault of the showrunner at the time: Mike Scully for Seasons 9-12 (September 1997- May 2001), and Al Jean for 13-present (November 2001-present). Scully and Jean aren't innocent, to be sure, but aren't 100% guilty either.
<ul><li> The showrunner isn't personally involved with every aspect of the show: The writing staff comes up with plot ideas and first drafts of episodes, while the showrunner selects which episodes get made and leads script revisions. The showrunner also isn't all-powerful: the senior production staff can and do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">interfere with writing and plot ideas</a>.
</li><li> Scully inherited a show that was already going down: Season 8 was the beginning of the end, with many senior writers and producers heading for the exits, co-showrunners Oakley and Weinstein operated on the assumption that <em>The Simpsons</em> would soon be over <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note147jji');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note147jji" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note147jji');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">FOX wasn't threatening to cancel the show at the time, but 8 years is a long run for a show like <em>The Simpsons</em>, regardless of quality, and senior staff, Groening included, were dropping hints about the show ending because they wanted the series to go out on a high note.</span>, leading them to experiment with new art and plot formats that led to a drop in quality and lack of direction for the show.
<ul><li> The hardcore Scully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a> says he did so much damage that the show couldn't be salvaged when he stepped down as showrunner in mid-2001, but that ignores the changes Al Jean implemented on the show: of the disliked elements from Scully's time as showrunner, many were scrapped immediately while many more disappeared over time - very few of the complaints about episodes in seasons 9-12 can be applied to seasons since then, and vice-versa.
</li><li> Since he became showrunner in season 9, Scully gets blamed for that season's "The Principal and the Pauper", widely seen to be one of the worst Simpsons episodes ever, if not <em>the</em> worst. However, Scully was never involved in it. It was a holdover from Season 8, when Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were showrunners, Steven Dean Moore was the director, and Ken Keeler was the writer.
</li></ul></li><li> Al Jean also inherited a mostly new writing staff, presided over the retirements of the show's last original writers a few seasons into his time as showrunner, and took over at a time when the series was falling apart, due to both its age and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> elements introduced during Scully's tenure. 8 seasons was a long time, and 12 was positively record breaking. For obvious reasons, Jean's detractors also ignore his time as showrunner in the third and fourth seasons, generally regarded as two of the series' best.
</li><li> The voice actors have also run out of steam with recent seasons: Hank Azaria (Moe, Chief Wiggum, Apu) has voiced one-off characters since the show's beginning and admitted in an interview that while he would try to do something new for each of them back in the 1980s and 1990s, he ran out of ideas around Season 10 (August 1998 to May 1999) and can now pull this off only a few times a season, sometimes less.
</li><li> Matt Groening gets next to none of the blame for the show's decline, but he probably deserves more: Some of the big complaints about the last 15 or so seasons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">blunt</a> political commentary, and the show increasingly resembling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>. Incidentally, these are also some of the main complaints about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">Un-Cancelled</a> seasons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a>, which has little in common with modern-day <em>Simpsons</em> apart from having Groening at the helm.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> season 2 received a case of type 5, with Jackson Publick (credited under his actual name Chris McCulloch ) getting the accusation of "usurping" the show from Christy Karacas, as he was put in charge of being the story-editor and having the final call on scripts. If an episode fell flat, a plot twist was done that a fan didn't like, or if there was less violence, it had to be all on him. In actuality, the season 2 format change was something that Christy Karacas and Stephen Warbrick had wanted to do in hope of breaking away from being formulaic and getting to explore the characters' stories more.
<ul><li> Type 2 and Type 3 also come into play, as while there was some degree of meddling in season 2 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15qpqz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15qpqz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15qpqz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">mainly having to have the episode "Hot Chick" revised to remove an implication of rape, Mistress Kilda's death having to be toned down in "Lord Stingray Crash Party"</span>, some of the moments cited as being the network screwing the creators over (perceived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, revelations of the Twins and Alice's backstories) were actually things that the creators themselves had decided on (to obviously mixed reception).
</li><li> There is a lesser extent of type 5 with some of the new writers for season 2 (John J. Miller, Joe Croson, Adam Modiano), as none of them had written for the show before and were perceived as being amateurs or not "getting" it. In actuality, while the script is usually the writer's work, they evolve from boardroom pitches between all the writers and outlines by Karacas, the story editor revising the script over time, and there also being uncredited rewrites. In short, an episode that doesn't perform well doesn't always fall on one person. To contrast with the above situation, the writers and story editor in season 3 seemed to receive less blaming and outrage, perhaps as things had cooled down.
</li></ul></li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> often cite the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> as the reason that <em>Kim Possible</em> got the axe. <em>Kim Possible</em> ended a full year before <em>Phineas and Ferb</em> started airing regularly, and mainly because the show's creators wanted to move on.
</li><li> As a result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">Fandom Rivalry</a>, many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> fans blame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> for Disney Channel's bad treatment of <em>Gravity Falls</em>. This is not true, as <em>Phineas and Ferb</em> hardly shows episodes on the channel anymore and Alex Hirsch wants the animators to take their time animating and producing the episodes.
<ul><li> Some fans blamed Disney XD for the show's end, but it was actually Hirsch's decision to end the show as he wanted the show to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a>.

</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> fans blamed co-creator Glen Murakami for doing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>.

Not only was <em>ChalkZone</em> delayed for two years (and thus was not meant to be a replacement show), but <em>Zim</em> was still running when the first season of <em>ChalkZone</em> premiered (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em> are also blamed for this). The real reason why <em>Zim</em> was canceled was due to the show's high production cost, low ratings, and just generally being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>. Not to mention that <em>ChalkZone</em> itself was also treated horribly by Nick.
<ul><li> <em>ChalkZone</em> also got some flack from people who thought it was a rip-off of the 1970s cartoon <em>Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings</em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.manic-expression.com/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute-interview-with-bill-burnett/">Co-creator Bill Burnett stated in this recent interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he hadn't even seen it when <em>ChalkZone</em> was being made.
</li></ul></li><li> In a glaring example of the <em>Most Visible Target</em> fallacy, many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood"> Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a></em> blamed the new kid on the block, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordParty">Word Party</a></em>, as the reason the former was dropped from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>, as the former (along with a whole plathora of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NineStoryMediaGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NineStoryMediaGroup">9 Story Media Group</a> shows) was dropped days before the latter premiered. The real reason is that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/01/amazon-prime-pbs-kids-deal">Amazon had just snatched the rights out of Netflix's hands by signing a (questionably legal) multi-year exclusive deal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to stream <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBSKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBSKids">PBS Kids</a> shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> is often blamed as the main reason for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s decline in the late-2000s. In actuality, Nick would often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">refuse</a> to give other shows a proper chance regardless, with <em>SpongeBob</em> likely having nothing to do with any other show's chances. Also, anyone involved with <em>SpongeBob</em> doesn't work in Nickelodeon's scheduling department, and would probably be receptive to their programmers actually having a schedule with various programs throughout the day rather than Ctrl+V'ing <em>SpongeBob</em> throughout the broadcast day.
<ul><li> The same can be said about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>. In particular, <em>Teen Titans Go</em> is often blamed for causing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> to end, even though both of those series were deliberately ended by their creators.
</li></ul></li><li> Many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> blamed Dreamworks for the new designs introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTalesInTheHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTalesInTheHouse">VeggieTales in the House</a></em>. It was actually Big Idea's decision to change the characters' designs since the original was based on the old animation software from the '90s.
</li><li> There's a certain group of people that will often claim that adding a Spanish-speaking character to a children's show produced for the United States market is done to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">cash in on the success of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em>. For example, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales">Dragon Tales</a></em> added Enrique and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> added Tracker, a lot of people claimed that this was to make the shows closer in tone to <em>Dora</em>. The same criticism was even given to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MayaAndMiguel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MayaAndMiguel">Maya &amp; Miguel</a></em> before it premiered. The truth is that like most things about children's television, Latino characters teaching Spanish was pioneered by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> with the character of Maria in 1971 and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muppet">Muppet</a> Rosita two decades later. There were also some shows before 2000 that utilized Spanish speaking characters, with Quetzal in the aforementioned <em>Dragon Tales</em> speaking Spanish from time to time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> saying that Max and Emmy are Hispanic themselves.
<ul><li> It's a similar situation with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeInteractivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeInteractivity">Fake Interactivity</a> trope: many believe that shows that use this are also trying to copy Dora's success, when this is actually a learning method that works surprisingly well compared to a show like <em>Sesame Street</em> which is story-based. In fact, the company that did this research produced a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog">Clifford the Big Red Dog</a></em> specials in the 80's meant to test this method.

In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB">Kids' WB!</a> helped produce the early seasons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> co-produced the show's later seasons, both with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Supernoobs">Supernoobs</a></em>, which was also made by Scott Fellows, has received the same kind of flak despite having a similar production background.
</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>, it's not uncommon to hear people accuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a> as being responsible for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> pilot remade into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> final product. In reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> mandated all the changes in order to make the series more kid-friendly and thus more marketable to American audiences (since Americans are generally more religious than Canadians) while Teletoon <em>approved</em> the pilot concept without issue due to originally intending the series for tweens and young teens (i.e. a similar audience to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> series, their most popular show at the time). This is more evident with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">second season</a>, which received the tonal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">retool</a> it did at the request of Disney XD's executives rather than Teletoon's.
</li><li> Angry <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> fans frequently see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreshTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreshTV">Fresh TV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a> as being entirely responsible for many of the unpopular or controversial story decisions made in the seasons following the first. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> purchased the majority of the rights to the franchise after the massive success of the first season, giving them greater ownership and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">far more influence</a> over the show and its production than Teletoon, the franchise's channel of origin.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> To avoid any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">Flame Bait</a>, a lot of decisions made or proposed for a lot of countries out there are misblamed as being thought up solely by either the prime minister, president or whoever is considered the head of the government. Nope; that may have been the case sometimes, but not <em>every</em> time. Granted, this is a very easy thing to happen though, what with how most people won't know <em>everything</em> that happens in their government without actually being there, so most people know of it through the media. But the media has often misblamed things as being "All the head-guy's fault". The media will have you believe that the prime minister or president does <em>everything</em> by themselves—no mention of senators, governors, legislatures, etc unless they are caught in some scandal.
<ul><li> This also extends with business decisions made by large companies. Once more how would an average joe customer know what goes on in the secret meetings? For all we know, a decision that customers may not be fond of wasn't the CEO's idea, but <em>a department head's</em>.
</li><li> A specific example is the American presidency. The way most people blame the president, you'd assume that the president is some kind of single-person dictator or monarch who gets whatever s/he wants when they're in office. Bad economy? Blame the president. Social unrest? Blame the president. World in chaos? Blame the president. Mention the people who actually come up with acts and, unless they're in the news for something scandalous or are in a major position (Minority party leader, speaker of the house, etc), you'll probably get blank stares.
<ul><li> The Supreme Court, and federal courts in general, are also rarely mentioned outside of a few major decisions. Most people often act shocked in the media when nobody can recognize the face of a federal judge, but given how little coverage they get, can you really blame them?
</li></ul></li><li> US presidents have been blamed for the mass-incarceration problems and not using the presidential pardon to reduce prison population. In actuality, the majority of mass-incarcerations are made by state and local officials and even if the president were to maximize the pardoning ability, the incarceration population would only be reduced by 10% since pardons are for federal offenses only.
</li><li> The UK has a different version of the "blame the prime minister" fallacy. The Westminster government sometimes gets blamed by people in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland for something that is actually under the control of the various devolved parliaments (and vice versa). Health and Education generally gets excluded since they have been devolved since devolution became a thing.
</li></ul></li><li> High-ranking politicians rarely write their own speeches. In fact, generally speaking, the more important speech is, the <em>less</em> likely it is that the politician wrote it themselves. This means that many of a politicians' most memorable, catchy, or controversial phrases or lines were not his or her own creation, and may easily reflect a grander, more poetic, or more thoughtful perspective on an issue than the politician would offer on their own. Obviously, all speeches are reviewed by a politician before being read, and some politicians have a reputation for being aggressive editors, but even then, the various oft-quoted lines we cite to describe President-so-and-so's deepest beliefs on this-or-that will often simply be someone else's conception of what the politician believes.
</li><li> Oddly enough, low-ranked people also get misblamed, especially in stores. What's that, the local grocery raised the price on your favorite pizza again!? Better chew out the cashier over the despicable price raise — because surely, in a major company with three thousand workers, prices would be set not by CEOs or other executives, but a lowly cashier in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Flyover Country</a>!
<ul><li> Likewise, any issues with supply. Your favorite soft drink flavor got discontinued, or toilet paper isn't on the shelf? Clearly that's the fault of the first grocery store employee you see, not, say, the soda's manufacturer, who stopped producing a low-selling variety, or the distributor, who simply doesn't have the product to meet demand and therefore isn't shipping it out to the stores.
</li></ul></li><li> When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of a group, race, gender, etc. does something outrageous, in a lot of occasions the entire group gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonized</a> for it, including those that have nothing to do with it or even oppose it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Americans</a> for example: most of them are not loud, boorish, fat, lazy, uncultured, stupid, etc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">While many, if not all countries have "bad apples" as well</a>, due to the number of Americans in the media they are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInAmerica">painted as the problem child</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Certain feminist groups have declared the bra or brassiere a "man's invention" or some expectation a man places on them with some extremists declaring it a man-made torture device. In reality, the brassiere was invented by Mary Phelps (also known as "Caresse Crosby") who <em>isn't</em> a man and invented it to be an alternative to the much more uncomfortable corset, which is often attributed to ... another woman. Catherine de Medici of France is often attributed to introducing the corset and making it a symbol of beauty.
<ul><li> A double example, since feminists get blamed for the whole idea of burning bras, when in fact the notion was created by anti-feminists and the practice has never been adopted by feminists. And now there <em>are</em> groups of feminists who have started burning bras <em>as a result</em> of the notion that feminists followed that practice, making the conception true and turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLZzgbLCdFE">When a 14-year-old girl was interviewed on a lie-detector on the Kyle and Jackie O Radio Show and confessed that she'd been raped two years earlier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Kyle Sandilands received most of the vitriol, even though the girl's mother had known about the rape, yet brought her on the show to win concert tickets, had been asking the questions, and didn't tell anyone in the studio until later. While some blame for the girl's humiliation should go to the producers, Kyle's already poor image as a shock jock and Australian Idol's "mean judge" seems to have made him the main target, and distracted attention from the highly disturbing behaviour of the girl's mother.
<ul><li> Though it didn't help that Kyle's immediate response to the girl's rape comment was: "And is that the only experience you've had?"
</li></ul></li><li> In pretty much anything that's created by a multitude of people, the credits may not correctly identify someone as having any role, and even then, they may not spell out whose idea it was for something that people don't like. This happens in anything, movies, games, software, you name it. Most people don't also know exactly what it's like to create something or how much effort goes into it, but some people subvert this by studying what kinds of technology is used to create their favorite game or the scene in their favorite movie.
<ul><li> Metacritic announced in Spring 2011 that they would be giving scores to game developers, based on an average of the games they worked on. <a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/#!5786068/metacritic-now-rating-humans">Kotaku's commenters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> promptly pointed out that it's usually not Model Rigger #263's fault if they end up working on a poor game.
</li></ul></li><li> Some history books portray Hernán Cortés and his Spaniard conquistadors as being the sole destroyers of the Aztecs beyond smallpox. Not true — they had <em>massive</em> help from the Tlaxcalans and other Native American tribes who <em>hated</em> the Aztecs and saw the Spaniards as the perfect opportunity to get rid of them. Somewhere around 60,000 natives joined the Spaniards — there probably were <em>half</em> that number of Spaniards fighting at <em>most</em>. The Tlaxcalans were also treated <em>much</em> better, often being taken on future Spaniard conquests. Higher-class Aztecs were treated virtually the same for awhile after they were conquered, since Cortés wanted to maintain the structure of the empire. Also, it was illegal to enslave Indians; the law was just not very well-enforced. A lot of the slave-owners in Latin America went there to bypass the laws.
<ul><li> This is part and parcel in American history. People don't mention that intra-tribal warfare was on-going by the time Columbus arrived and that the tribes joined forces with Europeans (and their guns) to kill their enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> affiliate stations (unlike many others) are all branded prominently as "FOX [channel number]". Because this logo appears in their local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewsBroadcast">news broadcasts</a>, it is often assumed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News Channel</a> is responsible for their content or even that the story aired on Fox News <em>itself</em> (by people who apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">don't even know</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">FOX and the Fox News Channel are two separate networks</a>).
</li><li> Apple, Inc. supposedly had only one employee for a long time. His name was Steve Jobs. He was the one who did all of the research and development, made all of the decisions, built all of the products himself, and received all of the criticism, even after death.
<ul><li> Somewhat justified due to the control freak nature of Steve Jobs, who was famously particular and stubborn, going far enough that one of his employees, fed up after numerous rejected designs for the original Mac's calculator, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Calculator_Construction_Set.txt">made an application<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that could be used by Jobs to tailor-make his own design for a calculator, which led to the design that stayed for years, going up to OS 9.
</li><li> And similar to the above, Microsoft supposedly has only one employee: Bill Gates. Similar to how people yell at Steve Jobs for glitches/shortcomings with Apple products, any shortcomings/glitches/what have you with a <em>Microsoft</em> product are treated like it is 100% Bill's doing. Xbox 360 red ringed? Bill Gates did it. Zune broke? Bill Gates' fault. Didn't like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>? Again, Bill Gates. Note that Bill's retirement as CEO has merely slowed the complaints, not stopped them.
<ul><li> Since Bill's retirement, a lot of people just replace his name in complaints with Steve Ballmer's. Some even do this retroactively, assuming that everything bad Microsoft has ever done (including the stuff that led to their big antitrust lawsuit and nearly got the company broken up by the Department of Justice) was really Ballmer's fault and that the only thing Gates ever did wrong was failing to keep a tight enough leash on him.
</li></ul></li><li> Also concerning Apple, in recent years people have been accusing them of mistreating "their" manufacturing workers in China. However, the workers in question are <em>actually</em> employed by Foxconn, a huge electronics company with the likes of Intel, Sony, Microsoft, and many others among their clients. Apple are big enough clients that you could hold them responsible to some degree, but they could cease all orders from Foxconn tomorrow and it, sadly, would not change a thing about how their workers are treated. This lead to a rather huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>: articles criticizing Apple of using Foxconn employees were usually given lots of views and comments. However, fewer articles were written about Foxconn's <em>other</em> clients and the ones that were were, for the most part, ignored.
</li></ul></li><li> When Bill Gates became a household name, he suddenly became, in the minds of the average person, the man who invented computers, or at the very least, was the man producing all computers and computer peripherals on the planet. Many an IT support person or phone technical support person was regaled with how awful a man Bill Gates must be if he made a computer/peripheral that was this poor in quality. These complaints would often be applied to any and all computer hardware, including Apple products, printers and copy machines.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Microsoft Windows</a> is often blamed if any glitches or viruses occur on a computer. While true in some occasions, most of the time the problem is due to user error, hardware error, a bug on an installed program (often doing something that the documentation <em>tells it not to do</em>), or an infected file downloaded from the internet. And as for viruses, let's just say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">the internet is not always a nice place</a>. Most viruses these days are specifically made for Windows environment for the simple reason that it is the most common system right now, and thus a virus is most likely to infect computers and spread if it is programmed with Windows in mind. It was also the most common OS in many previous years, so there are a <em>lot</em> of very old, very insecure Windows systems still in use that are ripe for infecting (modern Windows systems used by non-technophobes rarely get viruses). This has led to Apple computers getting mis <em>credited</em> as being virus-safe when this is only because no one's creating viruses for Mac OS. This situation is now begining to change as malware writers are turning their attention to macs as well, which often lack the security awareness Windows users have normally built up <em>as a result of this</em>.
<ul><li> This is also starting to bite Android users in the rear too. Android is based on the Linux kernel, and many Linux users will tell you how much more secure it is than Windows. Except there are plenty of malware and malicious apps out there for Android, many of which are only do their dirty deeds because the user agreed that the programs have permission to do so.
</li><li> Not to mention, some of the problems with Windows Vista at first was actually with the drivers.
</li><li> Many people blame Microsoft for the fact that 64-bit versions of Windows don't natively support DOS and 16-bit Windows programs. In reality, this was a hardware limitation and therefore entirely the fault of Intel/AMD, since the new 64-bit x86-64 CPU instruction set doesn't allow for the execution of 16-bit code when running in 64-bit mode like it does for 32-bit code (which is why 32-bit applications run just fine).
</li><li> Also if you know anything about Windows internals, you'd realize that most times when an actual Blue Screen of Death appears, it's due to a badly written program attempting to do something which isn't permitted and not the operating system. Usually these are due to faults in 3rd party drivers.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of computer viruses, once that word entered common vernacular, layperson computer owners everywhere began to blame any little problem they encountered on a virus, as though the computer would run flawlessly if viruses didn't exist. When malware, such as spyware, began to be a common problem, users began referring to "spyware viruses", despite the two being very different.
</li><li> In France, most people who have heard of Edouard Pailleron believe that he was a really bad architect who built high schools that were very vulnerable to fire. He was actually a writer, his name was associated with it because the first such high school to burn was named after him.
</li><li> Some internet websites such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hulu">Hulu</a> are often chastised because some or all of their content <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">cannot be viewed outside of the US</a>. Some accuse these sites of only "catering" to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eaglelanders</a>" (and with anti-Americanism at its high, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">you can bet that xenophobic remarks will often pop up</a>). However, this is because of copyright and legal issues between nations and companies preventing the content from being seen legally in other nations. This is also true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">for companies from other nations</a> as well; just try and use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s iPlayer service from anywhere outside the UK.
<ul><li> The worst country in this regard is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse">Japan</a>, who actively seems to <em>want</em> to keep foreigners from using their websites and services, even if they just want to watch something or view fanart. There are ways to make sure the user is, in fact, located in Japan. Sometimes there are ways to circumvent these precautions, but they're absolutely draconian and may require help from someone living there. (The music industry, by the way, is even worse.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the latter years of the 20th century, Intel was blamed a number of prominent failures in their processor and motherboard lines due to errors in the circuitry. What was less well known was that the majority of the errors were introduced by 3rd party manufacturers who incorrectly implemented the specs.
</li><li> Honda's "Hoodie Ninja" ad drew some flack for portraying a Japanese-American character as a ninja because it was a stereotype. While the actress portrayed is Asian-American, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaniaGunadi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaniaGunadi">Tania Gunadi</a> has <em>Indonesian</em> ancestry, not Japanese. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the people complaining about stereotypes couldn't tell one Asian-American from another</a>.
</li><li> Many web server programs (such as Apache) include a default page in the document root directory. This default page is supposed to be seen by an administrator who is testing a newly-installed server, to verify that it's up and running. Sometimes the default page just says something like "It works!" and nothing else, but in other cases it gives the name of the server program (and in the case the program is from an OS distributor rather than the upstream developer, the name of that operating system) and a URL and/or email address for its developers. This has led to the following recurring situation:
<ul><li> A web server machine has a problem of some kind, so its administrator begins reinstalling the server software from scratch; or alternately, the server hostname's DNS record changes to point to a different server machine, one that currently has only an unmodified new web server installation (with no web content).
</li><li> Because of the above condition, the "default page" is served to web browsers in place of the content that would normally be on the server machine.
</li><li> Users try to use the server like they normally do and unexpectedly see the "default page".
</li><li> The users, frustrated that the server isn't working, complain to whoever's contact information is on the "default page" (that being the developers of the web server software and/or the developers of the operating system it's running on), demanding that they fix the server installation (which they can't do, because the server machine doesn't belong to them), and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.centos.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=127">sometimes even accusing them of hacking into the server<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> King George III of England in the USA, beginning in his own time. Although he was opposed to the idea of American independence, many of the grievances listed against him in the Declaration of Independence were actually the fault of individual government ministers in successive governments. Similarly, comparatively, he was rather moderate for a European monarch of the time. However, "Down with the tyrant George" is easier to chant than "Down with various ministers and the institutional ignorance and indifference to colonial concerns within successive British administrations!" Similarly, the nature of the British constitution would have made it hard for him to intervene anyway. He certainly had flaws in his foreign, colonial, and domestic conduct, but he was less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> than ineffectual figurehead. Then again, the colonists placing the blame on Parliament would have been a <em>de facto</em> recognition that Westminster had the power to govern them without their representation.
<ul><li> It remains British legal tradition to formally give the monarch credit (or, it could be said, blame) for every decision "Her Majesty's Government" makes. This is most apparent during the monarch's speech to parliament, in which she speaks in partisan language (written by the prime minister's staff) about the goals of "my government."
</li></ul></li><li> The excesses of the Jacobin government in the French Revolution's 'Reign of Terror' from 1793-4 are often blamed on the Parisian mob of 'sans-culottes' who are portrayed as murderous and bloodthirsty. While there is a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> to the latter in the early phases of the revolution (e. g. the mass-murders of September 1792) and while sans-culottes often provided the appreciative audience to public executions, this downplays the part played by the usually middle-class political leaders in rousing these mobs and who did not set up the Terror régime to pursue the war against the foreign enemies of the Revolution and to defeat and in many cases physically eliminate their political opponents in France.
<ul><li> Blame for the excesses of the Terror is often placed squarely at the feet of the radical Jacobin party, neglecting the circumstances that brought it about. Namely a war declared by the supposedly moderate Girondins, which extremists such as Marat and Robespierre were virtually alone in opposing. Their incompetence and corruption, and later their sparking of federal insurrection against Paris, are factors which made many people accept that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">"terror is the order of the day"</a> since France was fighting a war for <em>its very survival</em>. This does not, of course absolve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> and co. of their responsibility (suspending their newly created, radical, 1793 Constitution and abrogating the Declaration of Human Rights) but the threats faced by France were very real, and from the lowest depths, the French Revolutionary Army defeated all its enemies and centralized itself despite a blockade by the British intended to starve them and local insurrections supported by foreign powers. People also forget that far from an aberration of the Revolution, the Terror saw several unique measures such as subsidies to artisans and shopkeepers, a price-ceiling for bread prices, the drastic reduction of nobility in the army from 90% to 3%, the opening of the Louvre to the public, the Jardin des Plantes, and the abolition of slavery for the first time in any democratic state.
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to kids/young adults and their violent acts of crime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">the culprit will always be video games, according to the media.</a> Despite many studies that disprove the theories that kids who are exposed to violent video games over an extended period of time will become violent themselves, news outlets and activist groups will always blame video games as the sole defining factor on why someone went on a shooting spree. Video games can be an influence if someone's mental health is bad, but it is never the sole cause of violent behavior.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">The New Rock &amp; Roll</a>: not just video games. Over the course of decades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> have blamed comic strips, rock 'n' roll, heavy metal, punk, television, etc. for demoralizing youth. In virtually all the cases, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">the criminals just grew up in a bad background</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal, Joe Paterno was often criticized by the media far more harshly than others allegedly involved in a conspiracy, and even worse than Sandusky himself. As a result, many believe that Joe Paterno willingly allowed child abuse to happen under his nose in the Penn State locker room. The truth is, the Penn State administration did report a similar incident in 1998 and yet DA Ray Gricar declined to press charges. The other incident in 2001 was one of the three counts (of 45) of which Sandusky was found not guilty. How much Paterno knew is unclear but some sources state that he was initially only told of slapping sounds in the shower (with a boy who was later revealed to be 14, not 10) and that same boy actually spoke in defence of Sandusky. At worst, Joe Paterno should have done more; at best, he did what he was supposed to based on the information he was given. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">This is ignoring the fact that trained child care workers at The Second Mile didn't understand what was going on, and they had far more expertise than a football coach.</a>
<ul><li> Many of these people are the same ones who previously said that Paterno was a figurehead who had no real say in coaching the football program and that his assistant coaches did all the work.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2014, the New York City Saint Patrick's Day Parade has been heavily criticized by gay rights activists for not allowing gay groups to display banners (or any gay pride memorabilia) while marching. They don't realize that this ban extends to ALL activist and ideological groups. (That said, said ban was first put in place in no small part because of gay people attempting to march in the parade since the early 1990s, hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Mr. Smithers'</a> reference to the parade in "Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part II.")
</li><li> It's no secret that women in advertisements for clothes, lingerie and so on tend to be noticeable slimmer than the average female consumer. Lots of people say they want photo models that have the body shape of the average woman, but that's only half the truth. See, several major companies have run ad campaigns with more average-sized women. As a general rule, the products advertised that way don't sell too well. People can say they want average-sized models, but when it's time to vote with the wallet, they don't actually buy the clothes advertised that way.
</li><li> Muslims, particularly Umar bin Khattab, are blamed for the burning of Library of Alexandria. This myth started from an obscure and unbacked source, translated later without any verification, then became accepted as legitimate history. Historically, the large part of library was burned in numerous sieges in the past. Ironically, it's Butler, an orientalist, who clears this myth.
<ul><li> Starting in antiquity it was common to blame the most recent burning on whoever was out of favor at the moment: Muslims, Christians, Romans, and at one point even Julius Caesar himself.
</li></ul></li><li> In the early 1970s, the U.S. government took a look at the automotive industry and began to impose stricter regulations on safety and emissions. Some noticed that fewer convertible models were being produced during this time and blamed the government for regulating convertibles out of existence. However, the government was in the clear on this one. Fewer convertibles were being produced because those models weren't selling as well. (In fact, they made a comeback in the '80s.)
</li><li> A common one in certain parts of the US is blaming environmental regulations for the decline in coal usage, badly depressing its price and driving coal mining companies out of business, when what is actually happening is that natural gas is becoming so much cheaper and more convenient to use that everyone is switching to it instead. In other words, market forces, not regulations, are killing coal, but try telling that to people in West Virginia.
</li><li> Fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disneyland</a> frequently place the blame for the mismanagement of the park in the late 1990s on Michael Eisner. In reality, it was actually Paul Pressler and Cynthia Harris, who both came from retail and, to the detriment of the park, saw fit to turn Disneyland into a shopping mall, closing classic attractions to cut costs (in many cases, leaving the infrastructure to rot in plain view), and inventing the infamous "all rides exit into a gift shop" stereotype by, well, having many of the new rides exit into gift shops as a form of aggressive marketing. Deferred maintenance also turned Disneyland into a run-down place, but Pressler and Harris didn't care about the look of the park or guests' opinions, only money. This came to a head when their negligance got two people killed in two separate incidents. Only when Matt Ouimet came onboard as president of Disneyland in 2003 did the situation change.
</li><li> Another thing Eisner very often gets blamed for is the gradual decline and eventual end of the Disney Renaissance, said to have been triggered by his hostility towards Jeffrey Katzenberg. While it is true that Eisner was directly responsible for Katzenberg's departure, the truth is that Katzenberg had been unwittingly sowing the seeds for the downfall of the Renaissance as early as <em>1992</em>. Katzenberg breached Disney's contract with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> regarding the marketing of the film, and the end result? Williams vowed to never work with Katzenberg again, and he kept that vow for the rest of his life, and while he continued to work with Disney after Katzenberg's departure, he never quite forgave the company for what Katzenberg did, resulting in a 25-year ban on new uses of his likeness and unused voice recordings of his that will last until <em>2039</em>. Then, Katzenberg pushed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> in an edgy direction, and the results were disastrous, nearly setting the computer animation industry back several years <em>at the least</em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLasseter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLasseter">John Lasseter</a> convinced Disney to give him and his crew some time to get their act together. And <em>then</em> he had the audacity to approach Eisner for a promotion to Frank Wells's old spot, <em>immediately</em> after learning of Wells's untimely death in an air accident. No wonder Eisner was quick to rebuff him.
</li><li> Many critics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephMcCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> act as if he introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a> to America, which he did not. The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Red_Scare">First Red Scare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lasted for about three years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>. McCarthy is also blamed for aspects of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Red_Scare">his own Red Scare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for which he wasn't responsible. As a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">U.S. Senate</a>, he could not have been part of the House (<em>of Representatives</em>) Un-American Activities Committee. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHollywoodBlacklist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHollywoodBlacklist">The Hollywood Blacklist</a> was also not his fault, nor even his methods. His notoriety came from going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">way too far</a> with his interrogations and making himself (and, by extension, other anticommunists) look foolish.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> footed a lot of the blame for John McCain losing the 2008 US presidential election; not helping was that due to McCain's advanced age voters had extremely high expectations of his running mate, who was thought to be one heart attack away from the most powerful job in the world. In actuality, as most political analysts will tell you, while Palin did adversely affect McCain's presidential campaign, the main proximate cause was the Great Recession; then-President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> had fallen in popularity polls past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> at his least popular, and voters were, for all intents and purposes, so disenchanted with the Republican Party that even without Palin's public image dragging McCain down he would have probably lost anyway. Either way, McCain would regret his choice of running mate for the rest of his life, to the point where she was pointedly <em>not</em> invited to his funeral. To put it in perspective, the only other political personality explicitly excluded from the guest list was Donald Trump. <em>That</em>'s how badly McCain believed Palin had hurt his chances.
</li><li> The word "Xmas" for Christmas is often wrongfully accused of being used to remove any implications of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> from the holiday. In fact, it comes from the fact that X is the first letter in Jesus' title (Χριστός or Christos) in Greek. (Perhaps medieval monks started this—they had to write "Christ" so much in their copying work that they started writing X as shorthand.) This is also why Catholic churches have a big XP on things—it's "CHR", the first letters in "Christ". The expression "Xian" for Christian was originally not a pejorative, but came from online religion discussion groups where, like those medieval monks, you had to type "Christian" so much that Xian became the shorthand. In the absolute worst case of Misblamed, some fundamentalist Christians accuse Jews of "starting" the trend to remove any trace of Christianity from the holiday <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">despite it originating with Christians themselves</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">This makes them look even more ignorant than they already are.</a>
</li><li> For pretty much as long as print journalism as we know it has existed, newspaper and magazine reporters have not written the headlines for their stories, which are typically written by an editor (be it of the section or department they write for, a copy editor or the editor-in-chief of the publication) instead. It is very common for readers to complain directly to a reporter about a weird, bad or misleading headline on one of their stories, which they had nothing to do with coming up with, because their name is on the byline below it.
</li><li> Never mind that Wetpaint had stopped maintaining itself before Travis Derouin stepped in, took over, and renamed it Wikifoundry, and is sincerely trying to keep the site running, any time Wikifoundry suffers a breakdown on any level (up to and including Defcon 1), you can always expect the blame to be shunted over to Travis and Wikifoundry itself to be unfavorably compared to Wetpaint.
</li><li> In September 2020, perfume brand Jo Malone came under heavy fire after an advert starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoyega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoyega">John Boyega</a> was re-shot for China <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">with a Chinese actor instead of Boyega</a>. A lot of this criticism ended up directed at Malone herself, despite the fact that she sold the company to Estee Lauder in <em>1999</em> and hasn't been involved with it at all since 2006. The company were forced to clarify that fact during one of their several apologies, and Malone herself denounced both the company's actions and the mis-blaming, insisting that if she'd had anything to say about it, the whole thing would never have happened.
</li><li> In any given traffic jam, somebody (or, more likely, many somebodies) will blame it on the driver directly in front of them just sitting in the car without moving forward. Oftentimes, there is a different obstruction causing that driver, and usually more, to stop.
</li><li> The legal doctrine of Innocent Agent is mainly intended to avert this, and basically says in most cases if a person is tricked or forced into committing a crime they are considered an "innocent agent" and the person who tricked/forced them is liable. For example: if someone fraudulently says a person is trying to molest their kid, and a bystander beats the crap out of that person, the person who lied in the first place would be the guilty party as the bystander was (to his knowledge) just trying to protect the kid.
</li><li> The Long Island arcade Spaceplex made national headlines for being the alleged place where then 10-year old Katie Beers was abducted, and people these days blame that for the reason it closed. Spaceplex was not involved in the kidnapping at all, and it closed three years afterward due to its owners being involved in a Ponzi scheme.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu">The Spanish Flu</a>, which killed around fifty million people (some say up to one-hundred million) in the late 1910s, as it was so named because it was believed at the time that this sickness originated from Spain. However, this was a <em>massive</em> example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseCause">False Cause</a>; Spain was the only country regularly reporting on the disease outbreak while other nations censored news on the outbreak to prevent loss of morale during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> (in which Spain was neutral), so it only <em>appeared</em> as though Spain was particularly affected. The actual origin of the pandemic is still uncertain, although the first officially recorded case came from the United States.
