The reasoning is that even if people are trying to raise a big stink about how some work is immoral, incorrect, offensive, or corrupting the youth of the world, they're just giving it attention, increasing how well-known it is, arousing people's natural curiosity as to why this thing's so offensive, and making the work into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a>.
</p><p>In real life, there <em>is</em> always such a thing as bad publicity: For example, if it turns out a car model or another product has a flaw that endangers the lives of everyone who uses them, and this is highly publicized, the amount of people buying it is going to steeply drop. A little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> can devastate anyone's life forever. This trope refers to a something that <em>gains</em> popularity because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> draw attention to it. Strangely, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">never seem to learn</a> from the fact that they're doing a good job of making their objects of hate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">more popular</a>, thus, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolthing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolthing">free advertising</a></em>. On the Internet, it is usually those bad aspects of a product which the producer can never live down that undergo discussion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>, and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing">extra advertising</a>, notoriety and more misconceptions spreading around.

Edgy content always has a market, for example, pornography existed in the Victorian era but crossing the streams, i.e. bringing subversive elements into the mainstream was a huge taboo. Works are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney">Rated M for Money</a> when they target their expected audience and don't cross the line. However, this can backfire if you step on too many toes and often it doesn't mean that the work has more to recommend than the scandal. Sure offending some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> draws attention to a work but thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a>, expect later people to scratch their heads and wonder what the fuss was about. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> will eventually get bored attacking the same thing over and over. "Oh, look, [<em>insert creator here</em>] has released another extremely offensive and totally controversial [<em>insert media type here</em>]. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">How shocking</a></em>." This trope isn't just limited to Moral Guardians. Hatedoms have had this happen. As mentioned with the Control Alt Delete theorem later on the page, because people can be <em>so</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a> about works they claim to hate, people often find out about it from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> and either experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash">Critical Backlash</a> or even if they don't like it...<em>still</em> gave it sales or views.

No matter what your intentions were when you made a work, poor reception and bad publicity affect the context in which people see it, and your work will not be seen how you intend it but instead become a political or topical football. It can directly affect sales via smear campaign, boycotts and distributors not exhibiting your work because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">Guilt by Association</a>. In worst cases, controversy has killed careers by making it impossible for you to find people to see your next work, making you unemployable and so on. Also, don't expect critics to stand by you, they may see you as self-indulgent and arrogant and pan it, and the people who spend money on it are going to let others know that it's not worth it. Books, DVDs, or video games can still be returned, ticket refunds can still be given partway through a movie or show, radios can still be turned off, etc. Whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">Worth It</a> or not, depends on how much you believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">Viewers Are Geniuses</a> and your faith in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a>.

<ul><li> Although it was nearly canceled for it, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime first gained popularity internationally after the infamous seizure-inducing episode, <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP038">"Computer Warrior Porygon."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> There were a lot of downsides though. The Japanese studio had to hack up any sequence of Pikachu's electricity from previous episodes, which was sold for the international release, thus making a lot of the action sequences get extremely choppy. The studio toned down the special effects from that point forward and banned the episode, as well as effectively banning Porygon from ever appearing again (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">despite the whole incident technically being the fault of Ash's Pikachu...</a>).
<ul><li> Several American TV affiliates also refused to carry the show initially, though they quickly reversed their position when it took off. So while it got a lot of free press, the show still suffered for the backlash early on.
<ul><li> On the other hand, some foreign TV affiliates and distribuitors (like Televix for Latin America) actually picked up the show and dubbed it BECAUSE the Porygon incident made the show popular in the first place.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>'s notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RRatedOpening">R-Rated Opening</a> was one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">many</a></em> reasons why it got a lot of attention. It was unable to air in major markets due to <em>many other</em> reasons, and it only has one commercial. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">It does not mean</a> that it was unable to sell and be adored by fans despite being partially fueled by this.
</li><li> <em>Kodomo no Jikan</em> might not have gotten so much media attention if Seven Seas Entertainment had not publicly announced that it would cease distributing it in the USA because of its questionable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">Lolicon and Shotacon</a> content.
</li><li> A promo for <em>Magical Suite Prism Nana</em> was yanked from Youtube for a "nudity or sexual content" violation (it showed girls prancing around in bikinis, with a prominent focus on their attributes). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Not surprisingly</a>, this became a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/03/11/video-shafts-too-hot-for-youtube-prism-nana-pilot">popular topic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the video showed up on other sites almost immediately.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic">Pop Team Epic</a></em> can be considered to be one of the most polarizing anime adaptations of all time. It much like the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGO">Teen Titans Go!</a>! has plenty of haters that will stop at nothing to explain to a viewer or fan why their enjoyment of the series is wrong and how their taste in anime is trash because of liking it. That didn't stop the series from becoming critically acclaimed from various anime reviewers for being radically different from the norm and becoming so successful that not only is there going to be a special continuing the series despite the intense disdain but has a loyal following from both anime fans and people that don't watch anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism">King of Prism</a></em> got a lot of buzz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettySeries">Pretty Series</a></em> veterans due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> elements added into what is typically a young girl's franchise.

However, the buzz from the fanservice coupled with several eyewitness accounts of the movie helped propel the series into the mainstream. Masakazu Hishida even said he invoked this reaction in an interview, mentioning that the team added in the fanservice scenes so people could have something to talk about.

All this fuss lead to the series getting an enormous amount of attention from anime fans, casual and hardcore alike, and it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/12/09-1/the-rising-of-the-shield-hero-is-the-most-continuously-watched-anime-in-2019">reportedly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> became the most continuously-viewed anime of 2019. Additionally, the series spawned some of the most viral anime memes of the year, and, in a rare move, it was announced that it would be getting <em>two</em> additional seasons rather than one.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UzakiChanWantsToHangOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UzakiChanWantsToHangOut">Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!</a></em> was immediately met with outcry online over the titular lead's character design, with her combination of a rounded, doll-like face and gigantic boobs being met with accusations of sexism and female objectification, among others. However, this same outcry gave the series a gigantic boost in popularity from more hardcore anime fans, leading it to become one of the most prominent and popular anime of summer 2020, heights that most analysts (including those who supported the show) pointed out would never have been achieved otherwise.

</li><li> The media couldn't shut up over the controversy of the film's ultra-violence.

</li><li> The trope being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in France. Mel Gibson persuaded local newspapers to print an article about how the film was "too hot for France!" despite the fact that French cinemas had been very interested in carrying the film since its announcement.
</li></ul></li><li> Some movies that have been attacked by the Church became popular enough to be considered a blockbuster.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuelInTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuelInTheSun">Duel in the Sun</a></em> a highly sexualized western melodrama by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KingVidor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KingVidor">King Vidor</a>, produced by David O. Selznick was mockingly called "Lust in the Dust" by Catholic groups, which naturally led to a huge number of Catholics to see the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOutlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOutlaw">TheOutlaw</a></em> was held up from release for five years solely because of <em>a woman's cleavage</em>.

This also influenced producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHughes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHughes">Howard Hughes</a> to recreate the success of <em>The Outlaw</em> by making racy films, then have his employees pose as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> to actively encourage people to boycott them.
</li><li> The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElCrimenDelPadreAmaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElCrimenDelPadreAmaro">El Crimen del Padre Amaro</a></em>, a Mexican film (based on a book by Portuguese writer Eça de Queirós) about a Catholic priest who falls in love with a girl and decides to ignore his vows of celibacy, <a class="urllink" href="http://pacocalderon.net/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=1197">which actually turned overnight from a small, low-profile film into a massive blockbuster!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Which later resulted in the Catholic Church in Mexico wising up on this, and when other films (and even political parties) attempted to exploit their own controversy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">they refused to comment on them</a>.
</li><li> The Chilean Catholic Church tried to avoid this with <em>El bosque de Karadima</em>, based on the true story of Fernando Karadima, a priest who for decades abused male adolescents. The church gave strict orders not to comment on the film, hoping that the lack of controversy would make the film go unnoticed. It did not work, as the film attracted more than 300,000 viewers, making it the most successful Chilean film of 2015.

The Religious Right went nuts with protests, generating the film a lot of publicity and a by-word for controversial religious artworks (second only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses">The Satanic Verses</a>) but contrary to popular belief, very poor box-office sales.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BasicInstinct">Basic Instinct</a></em>: People were protesting in the streets because Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls">Showgirls</a></em> is about as well known for the scandal surrounding its NC-17 rating as it is for being a critical and box-office disaster. In a slight inversion of this trope, no major studio has attempted a mass release of an NC-17 film since its epic flop, and its taken numerous DVD releases for the film to show a profit, regardless of its cult success.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> wrapped up filming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeathLedger">Heath Ledger</a>, who was cast as antagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, tragically died from an accidental toxic combination of prescription medications.

People actually protested outside theaters, even though the Vatican themselves never officially commented on it. The movie made out well. Then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelsAndDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelsAndDemons">Angels &amp; Demons</a></em>, the prequel. The Vatican had learned their lesson, and beyond quietly refusing the filmmakers any access to their sites, and kept a tighter leash on the priests who did complain the first time. It still went on to make well over its production budget, but nowhere near the scale as the first with the controversy.

The additional publicity of Moore giving money to someone who became broke because of health-related costs while protesting a film that protests health care costs turned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

</li><li> At some point, some people started going to see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> just to see the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">overrated</a>" film people kept complaining about.
</li><li> <em>Caligula</em> would have come and gone in two weeks had it been left to succeed or fail on its nonexistent merits. It became successful, and something of a cult classic, solely because of the protests that it sparked.
</li><li> Invoked by Mark Cuban over the controversy surrounding his film <em>Redacted</em>. Lots of political pundits were mighty pissed about the movie's alleged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">Demonization</a> of U.S. Marines, to which Cuban — who produced the movie — responded by sarcastically thanking them for all the free publicity. However, <em>Redacted</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">barely made six digits at the box office</a>.
</li><li> Had it not been for his antics (criticising other directors such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EliRoth">Eli Roth</a> as being "Retards" and boxing matches) making himself one of the most hated people in the history of film, director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a> probably would have been forgotten by the end of the year had people not had such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">Bile Fascination</a> with his movies.
</li><li> A pair of news stories involving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Drive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Drive">Drive</a></em> — one involving a moviegoer suing the studio for false advertising and another about a golf spectator being inspired by the film to throw a hot dog at <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerWoods">Tiger Woods</a> — helped the film, which was starting to drop theatres heavily, stick around for longer in some markets. A few markets even brought the film back and had stronger results than its first run due to the publicity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> is one of the most <em>hated</em> people on the Internet, even on this very wiki people had to prevent pages for his movies from being excessively vandalized and slandered. No matter where you go, you'll look on Twitter and find millions of people lamenting at how some movie he directed actually making money - and yet they make more money than movies people hype as being "good".
</li><li> The anti-Confederate and pro-revenge themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DjangoUnchained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DjangoUnchained">Django Unchained</a></em> were bound to cause controversy in certain parts of the United States (along with the film's graphic violence) but it hasn't stopped the film from being a critical and financial success.
</li><li> The surprisingly strong opening weekend of <em>Fruitvale Station</em> was largely chalked up to the similarities between the film and the high profile George Zimmerman trial that was going on at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Khalnayak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Khalnayak">Khalnayak</a></em> was a controversial movie with India's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, specifically because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheItemNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheItemNumber">The Item Number</a>. The title of the song translates as "What's Behind the Blouse?" and the lyrics are a little cheeky. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Although the answer to the question posed in the song title isn't nearly as perverted as one would think!</span> Because of that controversy (and the prospect of seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadhuriDixit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadhuriDixit">Madhuri Dixit</a> dance), more people went to the theaters to see it.
</li><li> Darren Aronofsky's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah">Noah</a></em> got a lot of backlash from fundamentalist Christian groups before and after the movie was released due to the story being deviated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> which as Aronofsky puts it, "the least biblical Biblical movie". Of course, the backlash made other people, most especially atheists, become curious about it and it hit #1 in the US box office on the first week.
</li><li> When various religious groups began to organize protests of his new film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> was devious enough to join one of the protests. And ended up getting interviewed about it by a reporter who didn't know who he was. Rather than clarify things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">he stayed in character and denounced the film for its sacrilegious content.</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/QepgKVOVfZ8">See for yourself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> An interesting case concerning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterview">The Interview</a></em>. The film would have probably flown under the radar had it been about anything or any<em>one</em> else. However, because it was about the comedic assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un, it managed to piss off North Korea, leading to Sony being hacked and releasing a bunch of e-mail. Now everyone, even the President of the United States, wants the film released, but Sony, licking its wounds, had refused to. Though now apparently they are going for a limited release, on the original release date. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note183zz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note183zz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note183zz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fairness to Sony, they only pulled the film after the movie theater companies refused to show it. </span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanSniper">American Sniper</a></em> received a lot of flak from critics who accused the film of being propaganda for the military and glorifying its subject matter (Chris Kyle and the war in Iraq), with others also accusing the film of being anti-Muslim as well. Still didn't stop it from having the highest opening weekend in January - a whopping $89 million - and eventually becoming the highest-grossing film (in terms of domestic receipts) of 2014. Though considering the film was successful before the critical noises came out, it's debatable what effect the bad publicity had on the film.
</li><li> One time when a movie studio actually tried to Invoke this Trope (with rather poor taste) was in the aftermath of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily">Manson Family</a> murders, after the author of a true crime book on the Family inadvertently coined the term "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm">Snuff Film</a>" under the later debunked theory that the killers had recorded some of their movies. American producers brought the low budget Argentinian exploitation horror film <em>Slaughter</em> (based loosely on the Manson killings) over to America they, retitled it <em>Snuff</em>, gave it a new and even <em>gorier</em> ending, and launched a viral campaign that someone had actually been murdered on film as part of the movie. They even put out false newspaper clippings that reported a citizens group's crusading against the film and hired people to act as protesters to picket screenings. It was all blatant false advertising in an attempt to get people to watch what was an already-bad slasher movie, and it got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">very</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">bad publicity</a>, which only helped add fuel to a growing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> that real snuff films existed.
</li><li> After a news story where the trailer was accidentally screened before a showing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingDory">Finding Dory</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty">Sausage Party</a></em> attracted many curious patrons who wanted to see just how raunchy an adult animated movie written by Seth Rogen could be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFalconAndTheSnowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFalconAndTheSnowman">The Falcon and the Snowman</a></em> is a minor example. Although Googling it does turn up quite a few results and it was a well-received movie when it initially came out, many contemporary audiences have learned of the film because of it falling victim to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Midnight_broadcast_signal_intrusion">the Captain Midnight broadcast hijack.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The perpetrator, whose alias the incident is named after, was fed up with the then-new practices of premium content providers (HBO in this case) scrambling their signals and not only requiring expensive descramblers to view them but also a monthly fee on top of it. Because the perpetrator ran a satellite business of his own and it was causing damages to it, he blocked the signal out of frustration with an on-screen message in protest using the equipment he already had at his engineering job. He just so happened to be performing this intrusion during a showing of this movie, and because broadcast intrusions are such a rarity and pieces of history in their own right, much of the modern publicity this movie gets is due to this exact incident.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloudAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloudAtlas">Cloud Atlas</a></em>: In-universe. Dermott Hodgins throws a pompous literary critic who blasted his autobiographical novel over a balcony to his death, following which his book's sales shoot through the roof.
</li><li> The anti-nuclear documentary <em>If You Love This Planet</em> got an outright <em>obscene</em> boost in interest and popularity when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">the Reagan Administration</a> labelled a movie by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NationalFilmBoardOfCanada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NationalFilmBoardOfCanada">National Film Board of Canada</a> as "foreign political propaganda" and tried to have it suppressed. The film's director Terre Nash even thanked the U.S. Department of Justice for the free press when the film won the 1982 Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">Remember, Ronald Reagan doesn't want you to watch it</a> so <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FjgBBQFmGs">don't you dare follow this link!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Anytime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsVonTrier">Lars von Trier</a> made a movie and premiered at Cannes Film Festival, it would bring all kinds of press on his provocative antics and contents of his works. The most recent example is when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHouseThatJackBuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHouseThatJackBuilt">The House That Jack Built</a></em> screened at Cannes Film Festival 2018, it caused a mass walkout and standing ovations at the end. Later, all the one-night theatrical screenings of Unrated Director's Cut were sold out quickly and made even more publicity when MPAA nearly sanctioned IFC for "violating" their rules.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em> was the subject of much fervor from anti-SJW types during the lead-up to its release, due to star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrieLarson">Brie Larson</a>'s comments about the lack of diversity in film criticism, as well as the feminist themes in the film's trailers, which led them to assume that the film was going to be a feminist (and by "feminist" they actually meant "anti-male") propaganda. This, of course, only served to draw further attention to the film, which ended up clearing a billion dollars at the box office.
<ul><li> A year earlier, these same groups loudly resisted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther</a></em>, which was not helped by conspiracy theories about white audiences being violently attacked by black audiences in the theaters for daring to see "their movie." It ended up also making over a billion dollars.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeoneDOro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeoneDOro">Golden Lion award</a> at the prestigious Venice Film Festival, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em> received some negative publicity and media fears that it would inspire ideologically-motivated shootings. This led Warner Bros. to bar journalists from attending the red carpet premiere, and police forces watched over a number of high profile theaters that screened the film's premiere for security. That constant media drama only served to increase interest among moviegoers to see what riled up the media so badly, and the movie ended up making more than $96 million on the opening weekend, making its budget back instantly and breaking some box office records for the month of October.
</li><li> Universal attempted to do this with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHunt2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHunt2020">The Hunt</a></em>, a politically-charged take-off on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMostDangerousGame">The Most Dangerous Game</a></em>. In August 2019 the film was shelved after the trailer came out, in large part due to backlash over the film's premise as a result of some recent high-profile shootings. The trailer also received hostile reactions from the right-wing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> (though he didn't mention the film by name when he brought it up) because they perceived the film to be a glorification of violence against conservatives (which the filmmakers have denied), with Trump going so far as to call the filmmakers "racists." Six months later, the film was rescheduled for March 2020, with a new advertising campaign focusing squarely on the backlash; however, the film ended up being rushed onto VOD due to the coronavirus pandemic.
</li><li> HBO didn't think their documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingClear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingClear">Going Clear</a></em>, which was critical of Scientology, would attract many viewers. Then the Church of Scientology started an ad campaign against it. It later became the second-most-watched HBO documentary of the decade.
<div class="indent"> When I saw my name in a full-page ad in <em>The New York Times</em>, I knew. Docs dont get full-page ads, and when they do, they do really well.
</div></li><li> The anti-feminist blog The Return of the King published an article calling for a boycott of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em> considering it "feminist propaganda" (based on trailers only). This had a huge impact on the media, mainly to make fun of how stupid the idea was. Later the same blog published another article thanking the free publicity, because that way "more people would realize how Hollywood is contaminated by feminism." Ironically, this can be considered a subversion, since the boycott call caused many people, including many women, to pay attention to Fury Road, which has been considered one of the most feminist films of all time. The fact that this box office hit then won a slew of Academy Awards drove the point home at how much the sexist smearing backfired.
</li><li> Despite calls to cancel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> and the company's stock taking a hit, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cuties">Cuties</a></em> quickly became one of the most-watched movies on the service after being bolstered by controversy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> is an excellent example. If not for all its controversial aspects, it probably wouldn't be nearly as well known as it is.
<ul><li> <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em>, a "nonfiction" book based on similar ideas got a lot of publicity and sales when the authors sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown">Dan Brown</a> for plagiarism, even though they lost the case.
<ul><li> Of course, they lost because they claimed their book was nonfiction because you can't plagiarize facts or even "facts". If they had claimed they made the whole thing up, they likely would have won.
</li></ul></li><li> During a television special on <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, one of the authors of <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em> willingly and deliberately provided a lot of information on both books and was actually pretty informative. It seems the authors didn't care so much about having Dan Brown using similar ideas to them because it got them a lot more publicity and opportunities to appear on television to advertise their book. Very smart!
</li><li> The ironic thing is, the biggest controversial idea brought up in the book - that Mary Magdalene was actually Jesus' wife and that the facts were changed by whoever first penned the information about her in the Bible - is nothing new. The idea has been floating around for <em>centuries</em>, the book was only the first to suggest it in such a public way.
</li><li> This also happens to Dan Brown's sixth novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DanBrownsInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DanBrownsInferno">Inferno</a></em>, where the novel's description of Manila, which is the setting of one of the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a>, received some outcry from some Filipinos. This also led to some curious people buying the novel and only to find out that the description has nothing to do with the plot. Somehow, the controversy also serves as an eye-opener to the Manila city government to improve the city's state.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> owes a small percentage of its success to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> who can't shut up about how it's corrupting children, though this controversy came much later in the day.
<ul><li> Also occurs in-story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">The Order of the Phoenix</a></em> with Umbridge's ban of Harry's <em>Quibbler</em> interview. As Hermione <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out</a>, "If there was one thing she could have done to ensure everyone would read [his] article it was banning it." (This is almost certainly a deliberate in-joke by Rowling, who had heard <em>a lot</em> of this sort of argument after the first four volumes.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf">Mein Kampf</a></em>, Hitler's famous screed, is banned in Germany. Despite this, it still makes the bestsellers list there almost every year. Note that the book itself cannot make it to the bestseller list, given that it wasn't openly sold in its entirety in Germany for nearly 60 years now. The Bavarian state has the copyright for that book that will expire in 2015 (70 years after Hitler's death) and tightly controls reprinting and selling of uncommented or complete copies in Germany. The only openly available prints outside of the Internet are either old, commented or cut. Remarkable, as the book itself is not a good read; when it was force-fed to the population, almost no one read it. (Possibly the reverse effect of this trope.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken">Al Franken</a> wrote a book called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</a></em>. Fox News, one of the entities with which Franken has a grudge and directly antagonizes in the book's pages, immediately sued for use of their trademarked "Fair and Balanced" tagline, in an attempt to prevent the book from being published. As a result, a lot of people bought the book just to see what all the hubbub was about.
<ul><li> The lawsuit was particularly telling on a number of grounds in and of itself: Fox News did not draw complaints about the portrayals of their anchors (though, to be fair, the book was not yet published at the time), and the suit was functionally <em>laughed out of court</em>, with the judge essentially telling Fox News that their complaint was entirely baseless. Franken did not miss the opportunity to include that information in the republication of his book.
<ul><li> And just over a year after becoming Minnesota's new U.S. Senator, Franken presided over <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Chin">that selfsame judge's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> confirmation hearings for a promotion to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> tried this and failed. The author, Philip Pullman, wanted the series to offend lots of people, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> were too busy criticizing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>. To quote:
<div class="indent"><em>"I've been surprised by how little criticism I've got. Harry Potter's been taking all the flak... Meanwhile, I've been flying under the radar, saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said. My books are about killing God."</em>
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> was more successful at drawing fire, but this didn't lead to any notable box office assistance.

Then came the revelation that the author had made up a good portion of the book, which he was selling as a nonfiction memoir. The publicity his book got from having Oprah rake him over the coals was amazing, and sales still went on, because everyone wanted to know what pissed off Oprah.
</li><li> Most of the works on this list have aroused a lot of controversy but how many have provoked national leaders to call for the author's execution? Ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalmanRushdie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalmanRushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatanicVerses">The Satanic Verses</a></em>. After the book's publication, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a <em>fatwa</em> calling on all Muslims to kill Rushdie and his publishers. The book's Japanese translator was killed, the Italian, Norwegian and Turkish translators were attacked, and Rushdie himself had to be put under police protection. Most people would never have heard of the book if not for the <em>fatwa</em>. Regardless, many people bought copies of the novel afterwards if only to defy Khomeini and show support for Rushdie dealing with this threat.
<ul><li> And indeed most people outside the Muslim world would not have heard of a <em>fatwa</em> if not for the book. This sometimes leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a>.
</li><li> This also worked for the Ayatollah; something a lot of people forget is that <em>The Satanic Verses</em> actually had an Iranian publication and was reviewed in Iranian media. It was only when the Ayatollah needed to shore up internal support that he released the <em>fatwa</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatcherInTheRye">The Catcher in the Rye</a></em>. If it weren't for all the censorship over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">swear</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">words</a>, teenage prostitution and teen drinking, it would not have sold so well, nor would it have found its way into required reading curriculum. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain">Some asshole whose name isn't worth mentioning</a> holding a copy as he killed John Lennon didn't hurt either.
</li><li> The novella <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGodPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatGodPan">The Great God Pan</a></em>, published in 1890 (and again in 1894) by Arthur Machen, was decried by the Victorian era press for its immoral and sexual content (for example, a character's "seizures" are actually revealed to be orgasmic convulsions). It went on to become a best-seller of the time period.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> once wrote to his editor: "Apparently, the Concord library has condemned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn">Huck</a> as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another five thousand copies for sure!" And boy was he right... many libraries around the United States at least usually run a week celebrating "Banned books" that were "challenged" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> back in the day, encouraging kids to read them. Look through the library and ask yourself this... how many kids would have willingly picked up <em>half</em> those books of their own free will were it not for that? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></em> is just about the number one on the list.
</li><li> In-story example: In Andrew Clements' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frindle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frindle">Frindle</a></em>, Nick's teacher expresses outraged disapproval at his creation of a new word for 'pen', spreading it far further than it would have otherwise. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's quite cunning and was playing up the villain in order to do precisely that</span>.
</li><li> Kaavya Viswanathan's debut novel, <em>How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</em>, had already generated quite a bit of publicity at the time of its 2006 release, due to the author being 19 and having written it during her freshman year at Harvard. However, things completely blew up four weeks later when the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> reported that over 40 passages in the book had been plagiarized from two other novels by Megan McCafferty. Sales of the book skyrocketed, but the whole thing ended just a few days later when Viswanathan's publisher recalled the book from stores. After <em>that</em> happened, people were selling it on eBay for $80! (The controversy couldn't have hurt McCafferty, either, as she had just released a third book at almost the same time the first two were suddenly back in the spotlight.)
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> had some praise back in its day that led to some of its success, the movies and books also owe their success to their Hatedom and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a>, too. A lot of people who never would have heard of the books or seen the movies actually went to read/watch them because they were so angry about it, unable to <em>keep their mouths shut</em>.
<ul><li> To put it into perspective... the original <em>Twilight</em> book was written in 2005. Wanted to find it then? You'd have to do quite a bit of digging in the back of the bookstore. Nowadays? There is often a "Teen paranormal romance" section, and <em>Twilight</em> regularly finds itself on the bestseller lists in the very front of the store.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyGotHisGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyGotHisGun">Johnny Got His Gun</a></em>, a rather famous antiwar novel, endured this. Published in the mid-30s, it was pulled from publication when America entered World War II; Dalton Trumbo infamously reported people who wrote to him, desperately hoping he had spare copies that he might be willing to part with, to the FBI for "hindering the war effort", as the novel was embraced by the US Isolationist movement in the early years of the war (while Trumbo was anti-war, he hated the Nazis and thought that they needed to be stopped). Trumbo's own legal problems due to his left-wing views only added to the book's mystique; it was brought back into print and adapted into a movie by Trumbo during the height of the Vietnam War. But the movie flopped, and the novel itself largely faded into view until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> bought the rights to the movie version and re-edited it to create the video for "One" (which was about the novel), their first music video ever. This revived interest in the novel and the movie, though in a bit of irony, Metallica sat on the movie rights for nearly two decades, adding to its infamy because many fans considered "One" to be the preferred version of "Johnny Got His Gun", due to the film being seen as being too longwinded for its own good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>, within the first year it was printed, sold over 60 million copies (more than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>!) and is printed in 37 countries. It owes all this to its controversial nature as well as the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> it spawned. Several groups have problems with the content. Reviewers criticize the poor writing style, BDSM practitioners dislike it for getting their fetishes wrong, feminists say it normalizes abusive relationships, and conservatives dislike the explicit sex. It got so much hate, TV Tropes had to lock both the main page and YMMV page.
</li><li> Budding author Jacqueline Howett, author of <em>Greek Seaman</em>, threw a fit upon getting a review that critiqued her grammar. The review and her completely unfounded, myopic, immature and (ironically) ungrammatical comments can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110401071913/http://booksandpals.blogspot.com/2011/03/greek-seaman-jacqueline-howett.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In one of her comments, she states that she's been getting an increase in sales due to the blog going viral.
</li><li> Religious scholar Reza Aslan (who happens to be Muslim) wrote a book about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist">Jesus Christ</a> and had a Fox News interview about it where the interviewer was clueless and even somewhat offensive. He shrugged it off and actually said: "you can't buy that kind of publicity." In short, people who might not have cared otherwise watched the bad interview to criticize or mock Fox (which has something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a>, to say the least) and that got them talking about the book as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShermanAlexie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShermanAlexie">Sherman Alexie</a> has frequently had his YA book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAbsolutelyTrueDiaryOfAPartTimeIndian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAbsolutelyTrueDiaryOfAPartTimeIndian">The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</a></em>, pulled from school libraries and reading curriculums... and each time sales of the book skyrocket. After one such incident in an Idaho school district (which resulted in pro-literacy groups <em>handing out copies of the book for free</em>), Alexie attended a reading-and-conversation seminar in Boise and said the following.
<div class="indent"><strong>Alexie:</strong> <em>When books get banned, I get a lot of tweets and emails and letters from people concerned that I am disturbed or hurt. I'm not. When my books get banned, I sell so many; the exact opposite thing the banners want.</em>

The titular protagonist runs a vanity publishing firm, and agrees to publish a smalltime gangster's autobiographical novel, which is universally agreed to be completely dreadful and unsaleable; then the book suddenly becomes a runaway hit when the gangster makes headlines by publicly throwing a critic from a rooftop for writing him a bad review.
</li><li> Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StratemeyerSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StratemeyerSyndicate">Stratemeyer Syndicate</a>, felt this way about a dust-up between him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> who felt like his popular children's books (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a>, etc.,) were little more than literary junk food who would turn kids off reading "better" books (this has since been proven untrue). When asked if he was upset that the Newark Public Library refused to stock his books, he said he was fine with it; if kids couldn't <em>rent</em> the books from a library, they were more likely to <em>buy</em> them from stores, and his sales in Newark more than tripled.
</li><li> When Scarlett Lewis, whose son was one of the children murdered in the Sandy Hook shooting, wrote <em>Nurturing, Healing Love</em>, a book about recovering from a tragic event, numerous conspiracy theorists who believed the shooting was a hoax swarmed the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nurturing-Healing-Love-Mothers-Forgiveness/dp/1401945864">Amazon page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in an attempt to discredit her, giving the book one-star reviews and accusing her of lying and scamming. This ultimately backfired though, as once news of this reached social media, hundreds of people came to counteract the negativity with positive reviews and raised the book's popularity and sales.
</li><li> When the Medved brothers wrote <em>The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time</em> at the back end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, they made sure to include some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">trolling picks</a> because the uproar could bring them attention back when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">Accentuate the Negative</a> wasn't as popular. Thus along with schlock such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster">Robot Monster</a></em> there were several better-regarded (if, even in their day, divisive) titles that eventually made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerEbertGreatMoviesList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerEbertGreatMoviesList">Roger Ebert: Great Movies List</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastYearAtMarienbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastYearAtMarienbad">Last Year at Marienbad</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IvanTheTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IvanTheTerrible">Ivan the Terrible</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringMeTheHeadOfAlfredoGarcia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringMeTheHeadOfAlfredoGarcia">Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</a></em>) <a class="urllink" href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/623-how-plan-9-from-outer-space-earned-and-lost-the-ti/">and one recent release<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">they regretted putting in</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOmen1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOmen1976">The Omen</a></em>.
</li><li> When the lawyers of the Donald Trump administration issued a cease and desist to Michael Wolff's book <em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Donald Trump White House</em>, the publishers announced that the book would be released four days early, and the book's preorders shot up to the top of Amazon's bestselling books list.

Michael goes out of his way to avoid saying his name, but context makes it clear that the descendant is Nimrod, the character who tried to build the Tower of Babel in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>.

Black naturally saw an opportunity and began retweeting these alt-right attacks to drum up more publicity for the book. Not surprisingly, it became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> itself doesn't encourage bad singers, every season has at least someone that is so incredibly bad that they become an internet meme for a month. In one season, there was William Hung, a guy that tried to sing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin">Ricky Martin</a>'s "She Bangs" and failed horribly at it, but was popular enough to get record deals and other recordings because of his positive personality and he took the criticisms in stride. However, there was another contestant that tried to sing the <em>Jigglypuff song</em> (yes, the same lullaby the Pokemon uses in the anime) and it sounded like he was trying to be bad on purpose. He didn't get the same amount of fame as William did, but he gained infamy nonetheless. It's a well-known fact that the producers would deliberately let horrible singers pass during the prescreening phase in order to display their "talents" to the judges and boost ratings from it. In either case, there are people that know they cannot sing at all, but will deliberately sing horribly on the show just to get their 15 minutes of fame, even if they are being mocked for it. Considering many people <em>only</em> watch the <em>Idol</em> auditions just for the bad ones, it works.

<ul><li> In "Close to the Metal", Joe has a journalist friend write an article about the new Cardiff Electric PC; however, Cameron loses her work on the BIOS just before she completes it.

When Joe was ready to walk out on Cardiff Electric, Gordon convinces him that the controversy surrounding Cardiff Electric can be seen as an asset, helping them stand out against the likes of IBM, Microsoft, and Apple at COMDEX.

Investors agree and Joe gets millions in startup capital.
</li><li> Subverted in season 4, when Cameron, frustrated that her publisher refuses to release her newest game, tries to get around them by leaking the game to the press. This ends up backfiring, as the critics rip it to shreds and mock her for her pretensions of still being an "rebel".

Their Facebook page's comment sections are often filled with complaints about the show's fakery and threats of boycott, and recap articles (especially from the Sydney Morning Herald) are full of snark.

</li><li> A subversion was the case of the Chilean sitcom <em>Vivir al Día</em>, from 1998, which addressed many topics that were then taboo in Chilean society, such as homosexuality, abortion or drug use.

<ul><li> Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards and rankings, particularly the annual 500, exist mainly to get people talking. The criteria for who is eligible and how they rank is very vague (though a few veteran readers have managed to find some patterns) and often deliberately against conventional schools of thought in order to get people who disagree with it to vote on the end of the year awards. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>'s Knockout Division inspired them to split women wrestlers off into a top 50 list, wound up generating even more hate mail over the years, because it is short enough for more people to read all the way through and excludes serves as an opportunity to exclude even more wrestlers fans care about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">despite being made to include more.</a> A common argument is that women should have just gotten more consideration for the 500 rather than trying than adding another fifty spots after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">an already lengthy list</a>, but PWI <em>had</em> tried that.

Ragtime, blues, jazz, swing, rock and roll, and its sub-genres, heavy metal and punk, and their sub-genres, and gangster rap.

Then, as the result of some teenager shooting a state trooper and claiming to be influenced by the record, Dan Quayle publicly denounces the record as having 'No place in our society'. Now, 2Pac is considered one of, if not the, greatest rappers who ever lived. 2Pac personally took great enjoyment in this public denouncement, using Quayle's audio clips as part of "Pac's Theme" in his next album.
<ul><li> 2Pac had this effect on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG">Biggie Smalls</a> as well. Biggie was fairly popular but had only put out one album at the time that 2Pac was accusing him publicly of being involved in his shooting. This, coupled with the subsequent East-West Coast Rivalry ensured that Biggie, who would only put out two albums compared to 2Pac's six, would be forever compared with and alongside 2Pac.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">deaths of the two rappers</a> also increased their sales, with both having albums that went Diamond as a direct result.
</li></ul></li><li> Southern rapper, Ludacris, was popular only with hardcore rap fans. He only became a household name in America after Bill O Reilly of Fox News went on a personal campaign trying to persuade his audience not to buy and listen the rap artist music, especially after the hit rap single <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/GUUTjmAyliM">"Area Codes"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> came out. Instead, the opposite effect happened and Ludacris became one of the biggest rap artists of the early 2000s, even being elevated to getting movie roles. O Reilly finally stopped his campaign against Ludacris, after it came out he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">sexually harassing</a> a fellow female employee, which many of his detractors pointed out as hypocritical. And despite many hit rap songs, the one rap song Ludacris is known for the most is... you guessed it, "Area Codes".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a>'s enormous popularity was fueled by the number of people protesting him (especially at the Grammies) constantly. He got hate from both sides of the political spectrum; the bible thumping Christians on the right and from gay rights groups like GLAAD and feminist groups on the left for his supposedly homophobic lyrics and for songs like "Kim" and "Stan" being accused of promoting violence against women, respectively. And he knows it; he said at an awards show that "Every time a critic pans me, I sell more records so I really want to thank you people." In an inversion, this is largely considered the reason he got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">snubbed</a> of the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2000 (the first time a hardcore rap album was nominated for it) losing to <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a></strong>. The Academy would have done anything to avoid the controversy of having to actually give him the award in the midst of the protests. To Em's credit, he toned down the misogyny and homophobia later in his career, even coming out as supporting gay rights.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo">Emo</a> was gaining some popularity among teenagers in Mexico.

They reached their peak for using this trope after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado in 1999. Manson's music was blamed for inciting the shooters in the massacre to commit their actions, giving them tons of free publicity from the news media. Manson's considerable decline in shock value was spoofed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a> in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/marilyn-manson-now-going-doortodoor-trying-to-shoc,459/">this 2001 article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

It was subsequently banned by the BBC (and its videos didn't fare much better) shortly after its release and hit number one on five consecutive occasions. Even the Beeb itself has poked fun at this in more recent broadcasts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> owes a good portion to his popularity to his obsessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a>. It's a vicious cycle for the haters: the more famous he gets the more they hate him, and the more they hate him the more famous he gets.
</li><li> Rebecca Black's "Friday" wouldn't have become such a hit if not for the people linking to the video just to show others how bad it is. The main difference here is that Bieber has a significant fanbase backing him, while Black does not.
</li><li> British boy band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a> fits this trope the exact same way Bieber does.
<ul><li> An American pop-rock band, Uncharted Shores, was known as One Direction for the first three years of their career and formed about a year before the British group did. As soon as a lawsuit was filed, Directioners quickly took notice and started protesting against the band, even sending a few hashtags up the charts; and the US group's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> videos had terrible like-to-dislike ratios. Unsurprisingly, nothing supporting the American group was able to trend.
</li><li> You can argue that it was the <em>lack</em> of bad publicity that ultimately proved to help 1D. When they first took off in 2012, most people assumed that the group was a flash-in-the-pan act would have faded back into obscurity by no later than the end of 2013, with the inevitable hype backlash set to kill them faster than it could ever do to Bieber. In a surprising twist of events, most of Bieber's hatedom chose to continue having him in their line of fire rather than switch over to the brand new targets. With that, 1D would roar through 2012 with a nearly unscathed public image, cannibalizing Bieber Fever as rapidly as Facebook did away with MySpace, with the public and media actually pulling their support behind them if only to wipe Bieber away once and for all. By the end of 2013, One Direction was more popular than ever and as massively popular, if not more so, as Bieber was at his peak, whereas the latter's career was on <em>life support</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, deliberately cultivated bizarre publicity for himself by becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">Reclusive Artist</a> and offering made-up stories to the tabloid press that claimed he 1) regularly slept in a hyperbaric chamber in order to live to 150 and 2) wanted to buy the skeletal remains of Joseph Merrick, the "Elephant Man". This and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTysonZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTysonZone">The Tyson Zone</a> applying to his real life by that point (this <em>was</em> the era of Bubbles the chimp, etc.) encouraged further wacky stories to circulate. Similarly, he didn't seem to mind all the negative press that came in the wake of the 1991 premiere of the video for "Black or White" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous">Dangerous</a></em>, which premiered on four different networks in prime time and started out as family-friendly, but ended with a tuneless, car-smashing, crotch-grabbing, fly-zipping epilogue. (The <em>Dangerous — The Short Films</em> collection of videos from this album includes a brief montage of post-premiere news coverage.) The public perception of him as a first-class weirdo turned on him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> progressed, especially after he was first accused of child molestation in '93. All along, Jackson <em><strong>always</strong></em> painted himself as a <em>helpless, suffering</em> victim of the evil tabloid press/mass media, and his fans continue to carry the torch for him after his death.
<ul><li> Michael's sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a> also received international attention after the Nipplegate incident in 2004, where she showed her naked breast during a Superbowl broadcast and caused a lot of controversy ... and higher album sales as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> The shambolic live broadcast of the BRIT Awards in 1989, which was poorly organized and hosted by Mick Fleetwood and Samantha Fox (neither of whom had much experience as television presenters) has been described as the most important thing that ever happened to the awards, renewing the public's interest in this show that was "prepared to take live risks". Ironically, as a result of this broadcast (which could only be described as catastrophic in almost every sense), the Awards weren't broadcast live again for almost twenty years. So much for taking live risks.
</li><li> The Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) did this for almost every band that they protested during the '80s, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WASP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WASP">WASP</a> were the ones that benefited the most, as their record sales doubled soon after Tipper Gore did her rant about how the band's initials supposedly stood for "We Are Sexual Perverts"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2021v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2021v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2021v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> to be fair, she drew this conclusion from that very phrase being inscribed on the front and back of their debut album, though it was still wrong, as Blackie Lawless later admitted the acronym didn't stand for anything; it was just a way to make the band's name stand out. </span>.
<ul><li> The PMRC also helped lots of musicians through their successful push to have "Parental Advisory" stickers, nicknamed "Tipper Stickers" on music albums, which helped let people know exactly which albums were cool and had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The original cover for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> 1966 U.S. album "Yesterday...And Today" featured the group posing in butcher aprons with cuts of bloodied meat and dismembered baby dolls. Rumor had it that this was in protest of Capitol Records "butchering" their albums by taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a> approach to the track-lists — in fact, the intent of the photo was to subvert the band's wholesome image, it wasn't intended as album art at all, and apparently it was Capitol themselves who chose to put it on the front of the album, without The Beatles' knowledge. After a backlash of initial protest, the boys made a second cover, posing quietly around a steamer trunk. Some album sleeves with the "butcher" cover that had not left the press shop yet had the new cover photo pasted over.
<ul><li> John Lennon's off-the-record quote that the Beatles were "more popular than Jesus" sparked even louder outrage, especially among the Bible Belt. His clarification and apology did little to appease the extreme fundamentalists.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles">The Rutles</a></em>, which pointed out that people were buying Rutles/Beatles albums just to burn them.

<ul><li> During a 1969 concert in Toronto, Cooper picked up a chicken someone had thrown onstage and tossed it back out to the audience, vaguely thinking that it would fly away. Turns out that chickens can't fly that well — it plummeted into the audience, which promptly tore it to shreds. This story quickly mutated into a rumor that Cooper <em>himself</em> had actually bitten the head off the chicken. Cooper received a phone call from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> asking if he'd done so. When he replied that he hadn't, Zappa said, "Well, don't tell anybody you didn't do it!"

Cooper responded by sending her a thank-you note and bouquet of flowers, as he believed the controversy helped the song hit number one on the charts.

Although she has been under conservatorship since 2008, she has continued to perform at Vegas and make albums.
</li><li> Though completely unintentional, Jennifer Hudson got a ton of publicity after her mother, brother and nephew were murdered. It made her into a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobie</a> and most likely has contributed to her success.
</li><li> Even fans of Norwegian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> bands like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burzum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burzum">Burzum</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> acknowledge that they probably wouldn't have heard of them if not for the various violent crimes committed by the members of said bands.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCount">Body Count</a> song "Cop Killer" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCountAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BodyCountAlbum">Body Count</a></em> is a subversion. The song garnered <em>enormous</em> controversy during the early-'90s (especially from figures like Tipper Gore) and was even blamed for the Los Angeles Riots that took place in 1992. However, in spite of its publicity, the song never became a hit outside of certain crime syndicates. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceT">Ice-T</a> himself has publicly admitted that (despite its massive publicity) it wasn't a very good song, so he had no qualms about removing it from the band's self-titled album.
</li><li> This trope may indeed be helping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> in her transition to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">more adult image</a> in 2013-14. She seems to be better associated as a "twerk queen" rather than "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>", and it has given her more freedom and new audiences for her movies, music, etc. She later made a switch to a more mature and softer image starting with the 2017 single "Malibu".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a>'s song I Don't Care is about this.
<div class="indent"><em>I don't care what you think</em> <br/><em>As long as it's about me...</em>
</div></li><li> Pussy Riot was little more than an obscure Russian punk rock band with a few political motivations that nobody in the west had ever <em>heard</em> of, up until the Russian government made such a big stink about their protest and convicted two members on "hooliganism" charges (for what most western legal experts would have defined as trespassing) and suspicious Russian hate sites targeting them with rather absurd accusations started to pop up. Almost overnight, the treatment of this obscure group became the focus of a global outcry, and opinion of the Russian government's policies started a downhill slide. (Which only got worse with the current crisis in Ukraine.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwoLiveCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwoLiveCrew">2 Live Crew</a> wasn't much to write home about when their career started, at least not until a Florida sheriff made shutting them down a huge priority for his administration. Predictably, they blew up.
</li><li> The Buoys' record label contract did not include promotion, so the band had to search for other ways to find a hit single. In came songwriter Rupert Holmes, who suggested the band deliberately invoke this trope and record a song that would be banned from the radio, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">making the public want to hear it more</a>. He wrote for them "Timothy", a very catchy song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">cannibalism</a>. Sure enough, the gamble worked out perfectly; their record label attempted to backtrack the bans by saying the titular "Timothy" wasn't a human, but a donkey, but Holmes refused to play along with the charade, especially given the bans only made people buy the single more.
</li><li> Vince Staples's song "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/mb6Jc4juSF8">Norf Norf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" gained a lot of attention after <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Q939EfR1EDs">a video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of an angry Christian mother ranting about (a censored version of) the song being played on the radio went viral, spawning many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidStatementDanceMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidStatementDanceMix">Stupid Statement Dance Mixes</a>. Said mom ranted about the song by reciting <em>all of its lyrics</em>, profanities and all, <em>while her kids were around</em>. Needless to say, people quickly checked out the song to see why it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkerTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkerTears">drove her to actual tears</a>, and discovered that the song isn't anywhere close to being another boastful rap song about material wealth—rather, the graphic language and imagery featured in the song are used to build atmosphere and tell a story. Surprisingly, Staples actually went out and defended the mother who made the video, saying he respected her views on the song, and that her clear misunderstanding of its intent didn't warrant all the backlash she was receiving.
</li><li> Rino Sashihara from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48">AKB48</a> took a hit in her career when an ex-boyfriend leaked intimate details about their relationship and sex life to the media, which affected her popularity (especially due to the group's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> and no-dating rule to preserve the image of being "attainable" to their male fans) and caused her to be transferred to a sister group, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HKT48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HKT48">HKT48</a>. However, the scandal actually made her more popular than before. She was later ranked first in the yearly line-up election and consistently ranks high in popularity polls today. On one variety show, she even (sarcastically) thanked the tabloids for running the story for bringing her newfound popularity.

Even during the 2011 "Summer of Punk", when he was at the center of the WWE's biggest storyline in nearly a decade and more intense down-to-the-wire negotiations with the WWE to get his contract renewed, Punk's homophobic comments against a fan didn't hurt him a bit, even after they got reported by Perez Hilton on his website.

But if the goal was to give any sort of extra publicity to <em>Tropical Freeze</em>, it certainly worked, as "Cranky Kong" peaked at the #2 Twitter trend in the hours after the reveal (indeed, it was practically the <em>only</em> thing retweeted from VGX), and all the angry reactions have kept the game's name in headlines across numerous gaming news outlets and forums.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> received some free publicity for its violent content, but it had primitive graphics and non-shocking gameplay (the player is your average good guy who merely kills hellspawn and zombies without murdering cops, working for mobsters or soliciting prostitutes), which reduced the potential for media scandal. However, after the Columbine High School shootings, it was reported that the shooters were fans of the game and that one of them had designed levels that resembled the school. While this was untrue - he had, in fact, designed some unremarkable <em>Doom</em> levels (one of which featured custom-made gorier monster death animations, albeit cheap ones), but none depicting the school - the media ran with it anyway, and kindly gifted <em>id</em> with a lot more sales.

</li><li> The downloadable PlayStation 3 game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatPrincess">Fat Princess</a></em> is about soldiers from red and blue teams rescuing their princess, who is being held in the enemy team's castle. The enemy team, for their part, can feed said princess cake to make her harder to carry. A blogger ranted about it and was trolled (the definition of a troll including anyone who disagreed with her at all). The trolled post currently has <strong>over a thousand</strong> comments. The end result is that several blogs made fun of the initial blogger, and several others linked her in support. The blog got a lot of new readers, and several gamers vowed to buy several extra copies of the game just to piss the blogger off. In other words, <em>both</em> sides of the debate benefited.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hatred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hatred">Hatred</a></em>, a Steam Greenlight game that was pulled from the marketplace due to concerns about the content... which caused controversy, not because of the content, but because it was removed from Steam greenlight. Not only was it placed back online (by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve Software</a></em> founder Gabe Newell himself, no less, along with an apology), it later became the number one seller on Steam Greenlight.

This, combined with an article declaring that an uncensored patch that was released violated Steam's ToS (it didn't) and an attempted smear campaign directed at the developer got the game enough attention that it rocketed up to #7 on the sales list shortly after and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">was met with a lot of praise from those who bought it.</a>

The game garnered an <em>enormous</em> backlash from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and parents alike, with some senators even lobbying to pull the game from store shelves and arcades altogether. Of course, this just added to the game's "cool factor" among children, and thus, the game not only became a massive success but (along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, mentioned below) showed the world that video games could indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">have grown-up appeal</a>.

<ul><li> A case where it very much <em>was</em> bad publicity, since none of those people actually <em>paid</em> for the game, and CNN's intentionally stirred-up moral outrage had nasty repercussions throughout the entire industry when someone started yelling at the UN about how much Japan sucks.

<ul><li> Worse, the Rapelay incident is the primary reason why eroge companies are scared shitless of even thinking about releasing their titles outside of Japan: they don't want the same happening to them.

Actually, <em>Sniper</em> was also the very first game he reviewed, so in a sense, they've both made each other famous. The game now has something of a cult following in the country, to the point where some fans have even hunted down and interviewed its Polish creator. Sadly he didn't receive any royalties from the game's popularity boom since the rights got sold off long before.

Given that the game was allowed to be finished and released before the order hit, it's been theorized by some that SEGA quietly approved of it and allowed <em>Remake</em> to circulate intentionally before dropping the banhammer. Of course, some could argue that SEGA took legal action <em>because</em> it was starting to get popular.

While still having no shortage of crude humor, the show switched more toward social and political satire.

Things became so bad, in fact, that MTV had to add a disclaimer at the beginning of every episode to remind viewers that Beavis and Butt-Head aren't real and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">you shouldn't try what they do at home.</a>

Ward's response? "Please sue us, we love the publicity." Kirby dropped it because his case wasn't strong enough.

The episode, "The Story of 420", pokes fun at this happening with video games.

While Larrity objects at first, he's then extremely happy as the labels cause their game sales to skyrocket to the point where Reagan then has to reverse the move and ban them from having the labels on their games.

Both articles decry the show for various reasons, which prompted the /co/ board on 4chan to see if really was so bad, causing it to take off in online popularity.
<ul><li> Likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FillyFuntasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FillyFuntasia">Filly Funtasia</a></em> definitely would've remained unknown for the longest time if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/EquestriaDaily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/EquestriaDaily">Equestria Daily</a> didn't report on the show <em>three times</em>, starting in October 2013. 4chan certainly helped with its popularity as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The DVD for the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> proudly displays a blurb from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> group review of the show warning parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">not to let their kids watch the show</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> had an in-universe case of inversion when Krusty needed a way to increase the sales of Absolute Krusty (yes, it's a vodka brand). Krusty was baffled at the idea of such thing as <em>good</em> publicity existing.
<ul><li> Speaking of which, the show itself generated an enormous amount of controversy when it premiered, due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">more adult tone</a> and, particularly, the character of Bart Simpson - who was deemed a bad influence on children. Needless to say, this just contributed to the show's runaway success.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Season 4 premiere episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em>, Pretty Boy Flizzy, a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a>, explains this trope to Tom DuBois, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Tom found out he staged the convenient robbery story and most of his other criminal actions, except the Christianna (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>) beating. He explains that his only fanbase are women who like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">bad boy image</a>, because women hate men who are "boring".</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow">SheZow</a></em> got the best free publicity possible when the far right One Million Moms attacked it as promoting a "gay transvestite agenda."
<ul><li> The same thing happened when they complained about two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>: "Overnight Success", in which we learn that Clyde has two dads, and "L Is For Love", which ends by showing the viewers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luna has a crush on a girl named Sam</span>. The show, which was already popular to begin with, had the fanbase grow as a result of these episodes.
</li><li> When they complained about and failed to get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em> banned for alleged Satanism and LGBT themes, it only made people more curious to see what all the fuss is about. The fanbase exploded in growth after the Enchanting Grom Fright episode, where Luz's friend Amity is shown to have a crush on her, and the show remains one of Disney's biggest hits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popetown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popetown">Popetown</a></em> was supposedly "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">meets</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>"; characters included an infantile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope</a> and cardinals involved with slavery. Success varied from country to country  in its native UK it didn't even make it on air.
<ul><li> MTV Germany broadcast the series in 2006, shortly after Easter, and added fuel to the fire with an ad in which Jesus had come down from the cross to laugh at the show (without actually saying anything about <em>Popetown</em> itself). This sparked a major debate, with many people demanding that it be banned for blasphemy and others pointing at press freedom. (Some of the defenders also pointed out that some of the accusers had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">themselves defended the Muhammad cartoons  some of which were much worse </a> a few weeks earlier, and that most of them had presumably only seen the ad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">instead of the actual show</a>.) The first episode subsequently achieved the highest ratings ever for MTV, but viewers soon found that <em>Popetown</em> was really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">nothing special</a> and it quickly fell into obscurity again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has earned a reputation as being one of the most hated cartoons in recent history...and yet it's one of Cartoon Network's highest-rated and biggest money-making shows partly because of this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BobsBurgersS1E3SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BobsBurgersS1E3SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a>". When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVegetarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVegetarian">Straw Vegetarian</a> named Randy is filming a documentary about Bob being a cow murderer for being a burger chef, it actually boosts the restaurant's popularity.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>:
<ul><li> Roman historian Livy wrote that the consul Marcus Manlius Capitolinus (died 384 BC) "preferred notoriety to respectability".
</li><li> Herostratus was a man, who in 356 BC, set fire to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenWondersOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenWondersOfTheWorld">Seven Wonders of the World</a>, solely because he wanted to be remembered. The Ephesian authorities not only executed him, but attempted to condemn him to a legacy of obscurity by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">erasing his name from all their records, and making it a crime to mention his name on penalty of death</a>. It didn't work out.
</li><li> In 1595, French author Montaigne wrote in his <em>Essais</em>: "Trogus Pompeius says of Herostratus, and Titus Livius of Manlius Capitolinus, that they were more ambitious of a great reputation than of a good one. This is very common; we are more solicitous that men speak of us than how they speak: and it is enough for us that our names are often mentioned, be it after what manner it will."
</li></ul></li><li> From a letter by painter Thomas Buchanan Read: "The small beer poets and ginger pop painters have always been industrious in abusing me into notice, and I am indebted to them, but shall not pay them back in kind, it being far more generous to let them remain in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">well-earned obscurity</a>."
</li><li> One truly ironic example. The Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 might not have succeeded if not for someone who opposed it. The organizers had little means to distribute the information to the black community except for word of mouth and flyers. Eventually, however, a white editor of a major newspaper got hold of one of the flyers and wrote a nasty editorial <em>condemning</em> the boycott, thereby spreading the word to the entire black community of Montgomery. (And seeing as not everyone owned a television or even a radio at the time, this condemnation got the word out better than anything else almost overnight.)
</li><li> Subverted by painter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali">Salvador Dalí</a>, who once said: "What matters is that people talk about me, even if it's good!"
</li><li> Take any bad review, whether it's in a newspaper, a radio show, a TV show, on a website, on a forum or in an Internet review. No matter how much the critics torpedo the product in question into the ground they often attract more curiosity from their audience to actually go out and check it out, even purchase it, than actually leading people away from it. This may sound awesome, but at the same time the audience sends out a signal to those companies to bring out more similar half-assed crap, just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons">the people will still come and check it out</a>. Every time again!
</li><li> An odd double example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a>'s shenanigans at the VMAs. While it's likely he did it in part because he was drunk (people tend to forget that he came up to the stage with a <em>mostly empty</em> bottle of Hennessy) and really did think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyoncé</a>'s video was better he still gained quite a bit of press from it. And then he conversely ended up giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> more publicity. Although she was already popular and successful, quite a few people admitted afterward that they hadn't known who she was until after the incident.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Comfort">Ray Comfort's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> claim that the banana is undeniable proof of God's creation of the universe has been thoroughly crushed, both for the fact that modern bananas are a result of human cultivation and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">Accidental Innuendo</a>. He's since made the claim that his public humiliation has only served to let more people know about the Gospel.
</li><li> Some suspect this was the idea behind the abortive Ashley Madison transit ad campaign in Toronto. The online dating site aimed at adulterers had offered the transit commission unprecedented amounts of money for the ad space and promised to stave off a coming fare hike, but of course, the organization turned them down, citing concerns over "family values", resulting in a storm of controversy over free speech and such. It's quite likely the reason so much money was offered was they knew they were counting on never having to make good on it and getting their advertising free from the local news instead.
</li><li> Sanford Wallace, the self-titled "Spam King" (e-mail, not meat product) was a firm believer in this. In the end, though, his spam "empire" has been smashed into little bits, and except for occasionally being targeted by lawsuits that mostly fade into obscurity fairly quickly, he's mostly a non-entity on the internet.
</li><li> Anna Chapman, the Russian spy who lived in Britain, who was a well-known example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything</a>, seems to be heading this way. Now she's heading into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> status, and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://nocussing.com">No Cussing Club<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had a lot of publicity, but because of all the hate mail and Anonymous attacks, it got <em>even more</em>. Now the founder boasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">not giving up</a> and even writes books and makes DVDs about his club, despite having (supposedly) been the most cyberbullied kid in the world at the time the organization had notoriety, which he proudly boasts on the front cover of his (dated) book.
</li><li> Those who subscribe to the "She outed herself" theory of the Traci Lords underage porn scandal (which includes pretty much adult performer and director active at the time) believe this was much of the motivation behind the initial outing: Lords wanted to ride the controversy into a mainstream film career. If that truly was the case (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">it's still unknown who actually leaked Lords' actual age</a>), mission accomplished. Lords has had a respectable non-porn career.
<ul><li> The controversy also worked out great for actress Vanessa L. Williams as well: Williams posed for a spread in Penthouse a few months before being crowned Miss America (and later stripped of her crown due to the photos.) This is the same issue in which Lords was that month's centerfold. Since the issue was thus rendered illegal to own or sell due to Lords being underage, distribution of it became extremely limited and allowed Williams to prevent her acting career from being damaged by scandal.
</li></ul></li><li> It's a common practice for companies — usually ones who can't even hope to pony up the cash to land an ad slot — to submit a racy/morally offensive/questionable ad to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>, causing them to get rejected — and thus landing them the publicity that comes with getting rejected from the largest stage of the commercial world. The aforementioned Ashley Madison has pulled this stunt.
</li><li> PETA. If they're not trying to turn children against their parents with nightmarish pamphlets depicting parents happily disemboweling animals or throwing the corpses of euthanized animals on the doorstep of businesses, they're posing nude on the street or writing a will dedicating their bodies to be barbecued in a public venue. Infamy just means the message is getting out there! Really! Even though, if you described half of these shock stunts to a neutral party unfamiliar with them, they'd have <em>no bloody idea</em> what message that's supposed to be.
<ul><li> PETA themselves has caused this, though, with their attacks against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookingMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookingMama">Cooking Mama</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy">Super Meat Boy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand">Super Mario 3D Land</a></em>, boosting the games' popularity. Majesco and Edmund McMillen turned PETA's attacks to their commercial advantages with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> statement and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> respectively as stated above, while Nintendo simply issued a response saying that PETA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory">overanalyzed</a> the Tanooki Suit<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note798tz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note798tz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note798tz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if you want to know, the actual statement is: "Mario often takes the appearance of certain animals and objects in his games. These have included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">a frog</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">a penguin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">a balloon</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">a metallic version of himself</a>. These lighthearted and whimsical transformations give Mario different abilities and make his games fun to play. <strong>The different forms Mario takes make no statement beyond the games themselves</strong>."</span> (if only because they didn't need bad publicity per se, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Mario being Mario</a>).
</li><li> After PETA's attack on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, it seemed like Nintendo had enough, telling them to cut it out and responding with "Nintendo takes its intellectual property seriously." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">This did not stop PETA from creating a sequel game</a>, not more than a year later.
</li><li> PETA co-founder Ingrid Newkirk even admitted that the organization was "complete press sluts."
</li></ul></li><li> In politics, this is known as "shifting the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton Window<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Political positions that are "unthinkable" become more accepted by being discussed in the media.
</li><li> In April 2012, the National Organization for Marriage (NOM<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note87bo7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note87bo7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note87bo7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No, not like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">sound of eating something yummy</a></span>) began a boycott of Starbucks for its company statement affirming approval of same-sex marriage, the main issue NOM opposes. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120425194323/http://instinctmagazine.com/blogs/blog/nom-s-boycott-is-already-impacting-starbucks">It seems to have backfired<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This was parodied by a <em>Huffington Post</em> article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-wooledge/microsoft-apple-unite-to-_b_1394821.html">in which Microsoft and Apple request a similar boycott<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> On a similar note, the anti-gay protests by the Westboro Baptist Church have actually hurt the <em>church</em> more than anything else as of late, and gained sympathy and support for the LGBT community. News of their protests often creates counter-protests numbering in the thousands, and state governments are finding more and more loopholes in the original Supreme Court decision to make sure they keep their distance from funerals.
</li><li> The Southern Baptists eventually gave up (saying so publicly) after their boycott of Disney for hiring gays and lesbians only made Disney's stock rise. (They had no more success trying to turn people against Starbucks, Cheerios, Oreos, Microsoft, and several other much-beloved products and companies, which is no surprise.)
</li><li> Officials from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">the Mormon Church</a>, have flat-out admitted that this is part of the reason why they don't do a whole lot to protest media that mocks their church, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a></em> musical or the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "All About Mormons" — while said media might not portray the church in a flattering light, it DOES get people curious, and a number of them investigate the church further as a result.
<ul><li> Some Mormon missionaries are even using <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a></em> to their advantage, handing out copies of the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon">Book of Mormon</a> as "souvenirs" at showings of the musical.
</li></ul></li><li> The UK courts have ordered major Internet Service Providers to block access to the file-sharing search engine The Pirate Bay by May 30th, 2012. Soon after the first ISP implemented the block it was reported that The Pirate Bay had actually seen the number of visits increase by several million. Many of these extra visitors are assumed to be people who hadn't heard about the site until it was reported in the news, while some others are visitors who are just trying to circumvent the block.
</li><li> Anyone on the internet that posts questionable content (as in controversial topics or posting subjective quality artwork) will usually get a lot of backdraft from trolls or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDom">Hate Dom</a>. The poster in question may use this sort of attention to keep posting more content that is sure to get attention no matter how bad or subjective said content is. In other words, the poster will assume negative attention equals popularity and will keep doing it.
<ul><li> There is a disorder that relies on this trope. People who crave attention will accept ANY kind of attention, even if it's a bad one because some attention of any flavor is better than being ignored entirely. It's also part of the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> trope exists.
</li></ul></li><li> Around July of 2012, the CEO of Chick-fil-A, a chicken-based fast food chain, made a comment on the radio stating that he believed in "the Biblical definition" of marriage. Combined with the millions of dollars he has donated to anti-gay organizations, including several that are labeled hate-groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, this caused a massive uproar across the United States and created a divide between the supporters and the protesters. The people that were appalled by the CEO's comment staged protests and boycotts of the fast food chain while supporters went out to eat at every Chick-fil-A restaurant to show the CEO their support. Some cities are also banning the fast-food chain from setting up shop in their city because of the controversial comment. A few months later it was announced that the company would stop donating to anti-gay groups a few months after the initial kerfuffle... and then it was discovered that they lied about <em>that</em>. All in all more people likely know about the company now thanks to the whole story than if it had never happened, and the chain has moved up from the 7th most popular fast food chain to the 3rd most popular.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GarbagePailKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GarbagePailKids">Garbage Pail Kids</a> trading cards that were popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Early on, sales were slow... then they started to take off when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">parents and teachers</a> started to complain about the cards being in bad taste and banning them from households/schools.
</li><li> Tea Party Express leader Mark Williams once called Allah "the terrorists' monkey god". (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a> ensues when one considers that "Allah" refers to the same being as the Christian god). He would later state in an interview with the Washington Post that the controversy incited by his statement had been great for the movement's visibility.
</li><li> New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had passed several laws and regulations that either regulates or bans something in order to boost life expectancy and to ease the strain on the healthcare system. Smoking has been heavily restricted (and he currently trying to make it illegal to have cigarettes out in full view in order to protect kids), trans fat oils has been banned in the city, and the mayor wanted all sodas sold beyond 16 oz cups to be banned, but the proposal was blocked by a judge. Citizens and critics alike blasted the mayor for trying to meddle in everyone's lifestyles and many have called him the nanny mayor, but Bloomberg openly stated that he doesn't mind being called a nanny if it means getting people to start changing their lifestyles for a better healthy one.
</li><li> It's still too early to tell for sure, but it looks as though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DuckDynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DuckDynasty">Duck Dynasty</a></em> might have inverted this trope. Ratings for the season 5 premiere (the first episode since Phil Robertson's interview, in which he uttered controversial statements) were <strong>down</strong> 28% from the season 4 premiere. <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> even <a class="urllink" href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/01/16/duck-dynasty-ratings-controversey/">commented<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, "Maybe there <em>is</em> such a thing as bad publicity?"
<ul><li> A big reason for that is, Phil made some more controversial remarks; aside from making homophobic comments (which Robertson's conservative defenders dwelled more on), it also included a statement interpreted as endorsing statutory rape (it should be noted that he wasn't), and another saying that African-Americans were much better off without the Civil Rights Movement. Even the most staunch conservative defenders of the First Amendment have limits.
</li><li> However, loads of <em>Duck Dynasty</em> merchandise popped up after the controversy - making some people assume the controversy was engineered as an attempt to drum up interest.
</li></ul></li><li> Newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst seemed to know this, so he decided to subvert it with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em> by giving it no publicity, causing the movie to bomb at the box office.
</li><li> Mimi Faust of the reality show <em>Love and Hop Hip</em> purposely made a sex tape with her boyfriend and even released a trailer promoting it as amateur porn. Just as she hoped for, it caused a negative stir in the media but became popular with most of the viewing audience. For one, the trailer caused the sale of shower curtains to go up, even selling out in some stores. Why? Because of a scene she did with a shower curtain on the video. And according to pre-order numbers, the sex tape has already made over 400,000 dollars and counting before the official release date.
</li><li> An Australian eatery named their new (extremely sugary and fattening) dessert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">'Diabetes'</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> had a meltdown, demanding that they change the name. The Facebook post announcing the name exploded. The restaurant's Facebook page gained at least 200 likes during the furor.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9ot53');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9ot53" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9ot53');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The restaurant briefly pulled the dessert from the menu, then brought it back under a new name after receiving requests for it.</span>
<ul><li> A similar thing happened a few months afterward with a burger restaurant in New South Wales. A post was made on their Facebook page <a class="urllink" href="http://images.goodfood.com.au/2014/11/11/5973995/Article%20Lead%20-%20narrow6308213311k2i9image.related.articleLeadNarrow.353x0.11k2hh.png1415646810504.jpg-300x0.jpg">mocking a vegan customer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, which, like the 'Diabetes' post from the above story, promptly exploded. Offended vegans left negative reviews on the Facebook page and Trip Advisor (most of the Trip Advisor reviews have since been removed), some even sending the owner death threats. As many consider vegans to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTarget">Acceptable Target</a>, people flocked to the Facebook page to watch it all unfold and support the owners, resulting in the page gaining more than 1,000 new likes. A few news sites posting articles on the protest gave the restaurant even more exposure. According to the owner, business increased significantly in the months after the incident, and it has remained popular since then. Many of the new and existing customers left sarcastic comments thanking the protesters for giving the place publicity.
</li></ul></li><li> Some political groups, in attempting to demonize their opposition, simply end up giving them free publicity. Especially if the demonizing group is larger and more popular than the opposition in the first place. If the demonizing is extreme enough, the reality may look reasonable by comparison. Sometimes the first group may even lose members, possibly defecting, because they get sick of the slandering.
</li><li> A number of commentators said this about the fledgling Formula E championship, an all-electric top-level racing series, after a major accident on the last lap of the first official race. The incident, between Nico Prost and Nick Heidfeld, generated buzz about the series in a way that simply talking about the fact that it was the first all-electric motorsports championship never could, though it probably helps that neither driver was hurt in the incident.
</li><li> Averted with OJ Simpson. Sometime after his trial for the murder of his wife, he released a book called <em>"If I Had Done It"</em>, recounting among other facts what he says <em>would</em> have done to kill his wife. The public backlash (and the publisher's own distaste of the idea, even going as far as calling it OJ's "confession") completely annihilated any chance of sales and of Simpson's fame from taking off again.
</li><li> French humorist Dieudonné M'bala hit this hard when his shows started to verge towards antisemitism, along with him being openly friendly with the negationist side of the French far-right (including journalist and author Alain Soral, considered one of the leaders of antisemitism in Europe). Things stayed calm until the government intervened to censor him, with (then) prime minister Manuel Valls launching a full-blown legal war against him. A head of government chose to focus on a single humorist instead of ruling the country did wonders for Dieudonné's publicity, with several people admitting they were looking him up just because the Prime Minister hated him.
</li><li> It would appear that while Keemstar, infamous for "Drama Alert" and "The Federation of Asshole Gamers" (abbreviated to F@G), has come under fire for downright falsifying stories, bullying people to the point that they have to outright resign from their work, being racist, abusive, homophobic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">and so on</a>, it sadly hasn't so much as dented his subscriber numbers.
<ul><li> However, he did lose a bunch of subscribers after a group of famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTubers">YouTubers</a> such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GradeAUnderA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GradeAUnderA">GradeAUnderA</a> and iDubbbz began to publicly call him out for his actions.
</li></ul></li><li> Katie Hopkins has basically managed to make a career out of offending people, then getting paid to appear on TV and 'defend' her generally insane viewpoint. She has been reported to the police on grounds of racial hatred numerous times but never prosecuted. However, she eventually ran out of media outlets that were willing to employ her and is now mostly working for an obscure Canadian far-right-wing website.
</li><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a>. In light of the information about the crimes he had allegedly done (sexual harassment and rape, all of the cases now too old to prosecute), not only has his career taken a fatal nosedive, but places and TV stations that considered him a darling worthy of emulation (because of his work for the advancement of the black community) have stopped broadcasting his TV shows and are now doing their damnedest to turn him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unperson</a> (a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a>) <em>while he's still alive</em>. And then there are the four words that someone in his situation should <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">never, ever tweet</a></em>: "<a class="urllink" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/bill-cosby-rape-allegations">Go ahead. Meme me!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"
</li><li> Oddly enough, this contributed to the development of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic">Fanfic</a>. Back when the genre was in its infancy, most studios and creators were scandalized or enraged by it, considering it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct">Shoddy Knockoff Product</a> that would diminish audience interest in the <em>very</em> expensive films and TV shows they were based on. Fanfic's notoriety when it came to explicit sexual and political content didn't help matters, either. Pre-Internet, if a studio caught wind of a fanfic publisher, they'd send out the lawyers and sue them into the poorhouse. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> and <em>no</em> stranger to controversy or overt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Trolling</a> of Hollywood sensibilities, <em>laughed his ass off</em> at all the Kirk/Spock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slash">Slash</a>, risque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilkSong">FilkSongs</a>, and definitely didn't mind political commentary. While others were trying to play whack-a-mole in stopping fanfic writers, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> actively <em>encouraged</em> it, and it contributed greatly to a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> TV show becoming a global phenomenon.
</li><li> In 2011, a group called One Million Moms protested against an issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LifeWithArchieTheMarriedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LifeWithArchieTheMarriedLife">Life with Archie</a></em> in which one of the characters, a gay man, married his partner. End result? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">The issue selling out in record time and copies being sold higher on eBay.</a> When they caught wind of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> was doing in an issue of <em>Astonishing X-Men</em>, they did the same. Marvel's response? "Please, <em>keep protesting</em>."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Floyd Mayweather Jr.</a> might be the king of the trope when it comes to combat sports. Floyd Mayweather Jr. started out as "Pretty Boy", a very good technical boxer. After gaining fame, Floyd noticed that he had a lot of critics and decided to use them to his advantage. He left boxing for over a year and came back as "Money" Mayweather - a cocky, bragging, personality that flashed his money and taunted his detractors about being undefeated. The result was Floyd making the biggest paydays in the history of sports itself. This was mainly because most people who went to the arenas and ordered his fights on PPV (Paid Per View), did so in hopes of seeing him lose. After he won, the critics picked another hope to beat him and the cycle continued. It all came to a head when many of his detractors believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Manny Pacquiao</a> was the guy to beat him and that Floyd was afraid to fight him. After a 5-year wait, because of negotiations failing twice, the fight happened. Floyd won and earned over 300 million dollars for the fight. He was named the highest paid sports athlete 3 years in a row by Forbes Magazine and won a countless number of boxing awards throughout his career. Floyd picked an easy fight in Andre Berto, afterward, which only made 400K PPV buys and retired undefeated in 2015.
</li><li> In 2015, a fitness supplement company called Protein World launched a billboard ad campaign in the United Kingdom that showed supermodel Renee Somerfield in a bikini with the tagline "Are you beach body ready?" The ads were immediately attacked by feminists who accused Protein World of "body-shaming." Rather than apologizing and removing the ads, Protein World used Twitter to mock their feminist critics by saying things like "Your insecurities are not our problem." This enraged the feminists even more, but a lot of people praised Protein World for standing their ground and not giving into the "cry-bullies." In the end, Protein World reported that the controversy resulted in a significant boost in sales.
</li><li> A quote attributed to C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup: "There are two kinds of programming languages: those everybody bitches about and those nobody uses."
</li><li> Sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Pewdiepie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Pewdiepie">Pewdiepie</a>'s less than okay gags &amp; reactions, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">his infamous Fiverr experiment</a>, lost him quite a few sponsorships and earned him plenty of media scrutinity, but as far as his subscriber numbers go, he's still going strong.
</li><li> Ditto with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron">JonTron</a>. While he made a comment that could easily be interpreted as extremely racist during an interview, his next video after the massive controversy was easily the most popular (although it's also because Flex Tape was also hilarious).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganPaul">Logan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakePaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakePaul">Jake Paul</a> have stood in the Internet spotlight for their wild and outrageous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jackass">Jackass</a></em>-style stunts and egostical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> personalities that held questionable reputations of them, but still let them succeed. Even the former's highly condemned Aokigahara suicide forest vlog, which everyone can agree crippled Logan's reputation and business relations, earned him many more subscribers.
</li><li> This is why destroying products doesn't work as a protest. Case in point: in 2017, Keurig withdrew sponsorship of conservative pundit Sean Hannity for defending Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of making unwanted sexual advances towards underage teenagers. Hannity's supporters responded by destroying their Keurig coffee makers out of spite. The "destroy Keurig" campaign was ridiculed since Keurig already taken the protestor's money and they only screwed themselves over for destroying property that they could've used or pawned. Then there are some people who went so far as to buy Keurig coffee machines ust to destroy them.
</li><li> It's safe to say that teenage environmentalist Greta Thunberg would never have become the new face in the fight against climate change if it weren't for the far-right harassing her on social media.
</li><li> The London district of Sidcup got a lot of attention after it was brought up that the UK version of Dasani was just purified water from the area.
</li><li> In December 2019, wedding-planner company Zola had an ad campaign featuring various same-sex weddings pulled from the Hallmark Channel after a protest by One Million Moms, which they rather pathetically tried to claim was due to violating a rule about public displays of affection, despite leaving in the two ads from the campaign that featured straight couples.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10uhgz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10uhgz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10uhgz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hallmark Channel is <em>very</em> popular among conservative Christians who see it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralAlternative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralAlternative">The Moral Alternative</a> to the "liberal, God-hating" mainstream networks, including actress Candace Cameron Bure, the network's biggest star.</span> Zola promptly declared it was ceasing its partnership with the network entirely, and facing down a boycott right in its busiest time in December, plus critics of the channel calling them hypocrites due to the head of the channel admitted that gay representation on Hallmark was not out of the question, the network quickly put the ads back, but not before Zola's sales began to skyrocket thanks to the controversy alone, with one marketing person telling the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>: "This is Christmas [sales] times 100!"
</li><li> Defied by Juan Flynn, a witness for the prosecution at the Manson trials. He was an actor, and defense attorney Irving Kanarek (infamous for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic">courtroom antics</a>) attempted to discredit him by pointing out that there was a lot of publicity surrounding the case that he could use to further his own career. Flynn bluntly stated that it was the kind of publicity he didn't want.
</li><li> The story of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Borker">Vitaly Borker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, proprietor of DecorMyEyes, an eyeglasses store. Once upon a time, he snapped at one of his customers, resulting in them leaving a negative review. To his surprise, that negative review actually <em>boosted</em> his Google Search, so he makes sure to try and harass a couple customers every month just to keep his shop at the top of search list while staying just below the threshold of getting banned. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">It worked</a></em>, but the sheer number of traumatized customers over the years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">finally got him charged and imprisoned.</a>
</li><li> Inverted by Gerald Ratner, the owner of the UK high street jewellery shop chain Ratners. At a speech for the Institute of Directors in 1991, he made disparaging remarks about the products sold in his stores, calling them "total crap" and saying a pair of earrings they sold was "cheaper than a prawn sandwich but probably wouldn't last as long". The value of the company dropped by £500m, and ended up having to rebrand completely within a couple of years. To this day executives damaging the reputation of their own companies are sometimes described as having a "Ratner moment" or "doing a Ratner".
